"204",10148,"face; then, turning on his heel, strode away from them down the forest","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"205",10148,"glade. But his heart was bitterly angry, for his blood was hot and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"207",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"208",10148,"Now, well would it have been for him who had first spoken had he left","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"209",10148,"Robin Hood alone; but his anger was hot, both because the youth had","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"210",10148,"gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts of ale that he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"211",10148,"had been quaffing.  So, of a sudden, without any warning, he sprang to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"212",10148,"his feet, and seized upon his bow and fitted it to a shaft. ""Ay,"" cried","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"213",10148,"he, ""and I'll hurry thee anon.""  And he sent the arrow whistling after","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"218",10148,"arrow whistled within three inches of his head. Then he turned around","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"219",10148,"and quickly drew his own bow, and sent an arrow back in return.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"226",10148,"the others could gather their wits about them, Robin Hood was gone into","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"227",10148,"the depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"229",10148,"they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to Nottingham","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"234",10148,"it was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"245",10148,"lasses of sweet Locksley Town; for he was outlawed, not only because he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"246",10148,"had killed a man, but also because he had poached upon the King's deer,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"247",10148,"and two hundred pounds were set upon his head, as a reward for whoever","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"252",10148,"wanted the two hundred pounds, and next, because the forester that Robin","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"256",10148,"time there gathered around him many others like himself, cast out from","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"257",10148,"other folk for this cause and for that. Some had shot deer in hungry","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"259",10148,"act by the foresters, but had escaped, thus saving their ears; some had","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"260",10148,"been turned out of their inheritance, that their farms might be added to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"261",10148,"the King's lands in Sherwood Forest; some had been despoiled by a great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"262",10148,"baron or a rich abbot or a powerful esquire--all, for one cause or","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"266",10148,"Robin Hood, and chose him to be their leader and chief. Then they vowed","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"267",10148,"that even as they themselves had been despoiled they would despoil their","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"271",10148,"give a helping hand in need and trouble, and would return to them that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"272",10148,"which had been unjustly taken from them. Besides this, they swore never","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"282",10148,"washing his head and hands in the cold brown brook that leaped laughing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"291",10148,"through highway and byway, through dingly dell and forest skirts. Now he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"293",10148,"word and passed their way; now he saw a fair lady upon an ambling pad,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"375",10148,"dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the crown that caused the blood to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2406",10148,"turned the blows to the left hand and to the right. Then quickly and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2407",10148,"with a dainty backhanded blow, he rapped Eric beneath his guard so","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2415",10148,"right good mettle, and also he had no sweet memory of the blow that he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2422",10148,"foiled, he lost his wits and began to rain blows so fiercely and so fast","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5450",10148,"they had come to a certain little church that belonged to the great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5451",10148,"estates owned by the rich Priory of Emmet.  Here it was that fair Ellen","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5452",10148,"was to be married on that morn, and here was the spot toward which the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5453",10148,"yeomen had pointed their toes. On the other side of the road from where","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5454",10148,"the church stood with waving fields of barley around, ran a stone wall","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5455",10148,"along the roadside. Over the wall from the highway was a fringe of young","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5456",10148,"trees and bushes, and here and there the wall itself was covered by a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5457",10148,"mass of blossoming woodbine that filled all the warm air far and near","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5458",10148,"with its sweet summer odor.  Then straightway the yeomen leaped over the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5459",10148,"wall, alighting on the tall soft grass upon the other side, frightening","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5460",10148,"a flock of sheep that lay there in the shade so that they scampered away","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5461",10148,"in all directions. Here was a sweet cool shadow both from the wall and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5462",10148,"from the fair young trees and bushes, and here sat the yeomen down, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5472",10148,"sleeping. Then all was quiet save only for the low voices of those that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5473",10148,"talked together, and for Allan's restless footsteps pacing up and down,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5474",10148,"for his soul was so full of disturbance that he could not stand still,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5477",10148,"upon his back and gazed aloft into the leaves of the trees, his thought","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5532",10148,"Little John and Will Stutely, had come to the church. Robin sat him down","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5533",10148,"on a bench beside the door, but Little John, carrying the two bags of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5534",10148,"gold, went within, as did Will Stutely.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5535",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5536",10148,"So Robin sat by the door, looking up the road and down the road to see","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5537",10148,"who might come, till, after a time, he saw six horsemen come riding","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5538",10148,"sedately and slowly, as became them, for they were churchmen in high","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5539",10148,"orders.  Then, when they had come nearer, Robin saw who they were, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5540",10148,"knew them. The first was the Bishop of Hereford, and a fine figure he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5541",10148,"cut, I wot. His vestments were of the richest silk, and around his neck","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5542",10148,"was a fair chain of beaten gold.  The cap that hid his tonsure was of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5543",10148,"black velvet, and around the edges of it were rows of jewels that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5544",10148,"flashed in the sunlight, each stone being set in gold. His hose were of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5545",10148,"flame-colored silk, and his shoes of black velvet, the long, pointed","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5546",10148,"toes being turned up and fastened to his knees, and on either instep was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5547",10148,"embroidered a cross in gold thread. Beside the Bishop rode the Prior of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5548",10148,"Emmet upon a mincing palfrey. Rich were his clothes also, but not so gay","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5549",10148,"as the stout Bishop's. Behind these were two of the higher brethren of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5550",10148,"Emmet, and behind these again two retainers belonging to the Bishop; for","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5551",10148,"the Lord Bishop of Hereford strove to be as like the great barons as was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5553",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5554",10148,"When Robin saw this train drawing near, with flash of jewels and silk","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5555",10148,"and jingle of silver bells on the trappings of the nags, he looked","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5556",10148,"sourly upon them.  Quoth he to himself, ""Yon Bishop is overgaudy for a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5557",10148,"holy man. I do wonder whether his patron, who, methinks, was Saint","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5558",10148,"Thomas, was given to wearing golden chains about his neck, silk clothing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5559",10148,"upon his body, and pointed shoes upon his feet; the money for all of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5560",10148,"which, God wot, hath been wrung from the sweat of poor tenants.  Bishop,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5562",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5563",10148,"So the holy men came to the church; the Bishop and the Prior jesting and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5564",10148,"laughing between themselves about certain fair dames, their words more","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5565",10148,"befitting the lips of laymen, methinks, than holy clerks. Then they","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5566",10148,"dismounted, and the Bishop, looking around, presently caught sight of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5567",10148,"Robin standing in the doorway. ""Hilloa, good fellow,"" quoth he in a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5595",10148,"horses. The first of all was a tall, thin man, of knightly bearing,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5596",10148,"dressed all in black silk, with a black velvet cap upon his head, turned","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5597",10148,"up with scarlet. Robin looked, and had no doubt that this was Sir","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5598",10148,"Stephen, both because of his knightly carriage and of his gray hairs.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5599",10148,"Beside him rode a stout Saxon franklin, Ellen's father, Edward of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5601",10148,"therein was a maiden whom Robin knew must be Ellen.  Behind this litter","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5606",10148,"horse and, coming to the litter, handed fair Ellen out therefrom. Then","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5607",10148,"Robin Hood looked at her, and could wonder no longer how it came about","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6692",10148,"youth with a tough quarterstaff in his hand came pushing his way through","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6693",10148,"the crowd and at last leaped lightly over the rope into the ring. He was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6694",10148,"not as heavy as stout William, but he was taller and broader in the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6710",10148,"shout went up, for William had gotten the better hold of the two. For a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6711",10148,"short time they strained and struggled and writhed, and then stout","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6712",10148,"William gave his most cunning trip and throw, but the stranger met it","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6713",10148,"with greater skill than his, and so the trip came to nought.  Then, of a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6714",10148,"sudden, with a twist and a wrench, the stranger loosed himself, and he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6715",10148,"of the scar found himself locked in a pair of arms that fairly made his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6716",10148,"ribs crack.  So, with heavy, hot breathing, they stood for a while","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6717",10148,"straining, their bodies all glistening with sweat, and great drops of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6719",10148,"that at last stout William's muscles softened under his grip, and he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8398",10148,"the different bands of archers, for the King's yeomen were divided into","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8399",10148,"companies of fourscore men, and each company had a captain over it; so","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8400",10148,"on the bright greensward stood ten booths of striped canvas, a booth for","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8401",10148,"each band of the royal archers, and at the peak of each fluttered a flag","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8402",10148,"in the mellow air, and the flag was the color that belonged to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8403",10148,"captain of each band. From the center booth hung the yellow flag of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8404",10148,"Tepus, the famous bow bearer of the King; next to it, on one hand, was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8405",10148,"the blue flag of Gilbert of the White Hand, and on the other the blood-","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8406",10148,"red pennant of stout young Clifton of Buckinghamshire.  The seven other","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8407",10148,"archer captains were also men of great renown; among them were Egbert of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8408",10148,"Kent and William of Southampton; but those first named were most famous","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8409",10148,"of all.  The noise of many voices in talk and laughter came from within","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8410",10148,"the booths, and in and out ran the attendants like ants about an ant-hill.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8411",10148,"Some bore ale and beer, and some bundles of bowstrings or sheaves","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8412",10148,"of arrows. On each side of the archery range were rows upon rows of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8413",10148,"seats reaching high aloft, and in the center of the north side was a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8414",10148,"raised dais for the King and Queen, shaded by canvas of gay colors, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8415",10148,"hung about with streaming silken pennants of red and blue and green and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8417",10148,"benches were full of people, rising head above head high aloft till it","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8418",10148,"made the eye dizzy to look upon them. Eightscore yards distant from the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8419",10148,"mark from which the archers were to shoot stood ten fair targets, each","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8420",10148,"target marked by a flag of the color belonging to the band that was to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8428",10148,"the guard, the bright sunlight flashing from the polished blades of the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8429",10148,"steel halberds they carried.  Behind these came the Court in a great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8430",10148,"crowd, so that presently all the lawn was alive with bright colors, with","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8431",10148,"silk and velvet, with waving plumes and gleaming gold, with flashing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8437",10148,"surging of the people, and the waving of scarfs and kerchiefs, the King","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8438",10148,"and Queen came to their place, and, getting down from their horses,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8439",10148,"mounted the broad stairs that led to the raised platform, and there took","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8440",10148,"their seats on two thrones bedecked with purple silks and cloths of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8443",10148,"When all was quiet a bugle sounded, and straightway the archers came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8444",10148,"marching in order from their tents.  Fortyscore they were in all, as","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8446",10148,"they came in orderly fashion and stood in front of the dais where King","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8447",10148,"Henry and his Queen sat.  King Henry looked up and down their ranks","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8448",10148,"right proudly, for his heart warmed within him at the sight of such a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8449",10148,"gallant band of yeomen.  Then he bade his herald Sir Hugh de Mowbray","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8450",10148,"stand forth and proclaim the rules governing the game. So Sir Hugh","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8451",10148,"stepped to the edge of the platform and spoke in a loud clear voice, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8452",10148,"thus he said:","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8453",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8454",10148,"That each man should shoot seven arrows at the target that belonged to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8456",10148,"the best should be chosen.  These three should shoot three arrows","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8457",10148,"apiece, and the one that shot the best should again be chosen. Then each","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8458",10148,"of these should again shoot three arrows apiece, and the one that shot","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8459",10148,"the best should have the first prize, the one that shot the next best","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8460",10148,"should have the second, and the one that shot the next best should have","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8461",10148,"the third prize. Each of the others should have fourscore silver pennies","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8462",10148,"for his shooting. The first prize was to be twoscore and ten golden","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8463",10148,"pounds, a silver bugle horn inlaid with gold, and a quiver with ten","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8464",10148,"white arrows tipped with gold and feathered with the white swan's-wing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8465",10148,"therein. The second prize was to be fivescore of the fattest bucks that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8466",10148,"run on Dallen Lea, to be shot when the yeoman that won them chose. The","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8468",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8469",10148,"So Sir Hugh spoke, and when he had done all the archers waved their bows","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8470",10148,"aloft and shouted.  Then each band turned and marched in order back to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8472",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8473",10148,"And now the shooting began, the captains first taking stand and speeding","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8474",10148,"their shafts and then making room for the men who shot, each in turn,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8475",10148,"after them.  Two hundred and eighty score shafts were shot in all, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8476",10148,"so deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done each target","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8477",10148,"looked like the back of a hedgehog when the farm dog snuffs at it. A","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8478",10148,"long time was taken in this shooting, and when it was over the judges","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8479",10148,"came forward, looked carefully at the targets, and proclaimed in a loud","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8480",10148,"voice which three had shot the best from the separate bands. Then a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8481",10148,"great hubbub of voices arose, each man among the crowd that looked on","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8482",10148,"calling for his favorite archer.  Then ten fresh targets were brought","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8483",10148,"forward, and every sound was hushed as the archers took their places","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8485",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8486",10148,"This time the shooting was more speedily done, for only nine shafts were","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8490",10148,"judges came forward again, and looking at the targets, called aloud the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8491",10148,"names of the archer chosen as the best bowman of each band.  Of these","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9132",10148,"as the yolk of an egg is from cobwebs.  At last he came to where a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9133",10148,"little stream spread across the road in a shallow sheet, tinkling and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9134",10148,"sparkling as it fretted over its bed of golden gravel. Here Robin","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9135",10148,"stopped, being athirst, and, kneeling down, he made a cup of the palms","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9136",10148,"of his hands, and began to drink. On either side of the road, for a long","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9137",10148,"distance, stood tangled thickets of bushes and young trees, and it","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9138",10148,"pleased Robin's heart to hear the little birds singing therein, for it","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9139",10148,"made him think of Sherwood, and it seemed as though it had been a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9140",10148,"lifetime since he had breathed the air of the woodlands.  But of a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9141",10148,"sudden, as he thus stooped, drinking, something hissed past his ear, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9142",10148,"struck with a splash into the gravel and water beside him. Quick as a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9143",10148,"wink Robin sprang to his feet, and, at one bound, crossed the stream and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9144",10148,"the roadside, and plunged headlong into the thicket, without looking","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9145",10148,"around, for he knew right well that that which had hissed so venomously","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9146",10148,"beside his ear was a gray goose shaft, and that to tarry so much as a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9147",10148,"moment meant death. Even as he leaped into the thicket six more arrows","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9148",10148,"rattled among the branches after him, one of which pierced his doublet,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9149",10148,"and would have struck deeply into his side but for the tough coat of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9150",10148,"steel that he wore.  Then up the road came riding some of the King's men","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9151",10148,"at headlong speed.  They leaped from their horses and plunged","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9152",10148,"straightway into the thicket after Robin.  But Robin knew the ground","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9154",10148,"running across some little open, he soon left them far behind, coming","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9155",10148,"out, at last, upon another road about eight hundred paces distant from","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9156",10148,"the one he had left. Here he stood for a moment, listening to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9158",10148,"like hounds that had lost the scent of the quarry.  Then, buckling his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9164",10148,"of the King's men seated in the shade along the roadside in the valley","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9165",10148,"beneath.  Then he paused not a moment, but, seeing that they had not","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9166",10148,"caught sight of him, he turned and ran back whence he had come, knowing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9173",10148,"coursing over the ground like a greyhound. He never slackened his pace,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9175",10148,"beyond the Derwent River, nigh to Derby Town.  Here, seeing that he was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9176",10148,"out of present danger, he slackened in his running, and at last sat him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9337",10148,"sevenscore and more of miles.  He thought now to travel on without","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9339",10148,"score of miles he felt his strength giving way beneath him like a river","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9340",10148,"bank which the waters have undermined. He sat him down and rested, but","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9342",10148,"feet felt like lumps of lead, so heavy were they with weariness.  Once","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9344",10148,"was fain to give the matter up, so, coming to an inn just then, he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9345",10148,"entered and calling the landlord, bade him show him to a room, although","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9346",10148,"the sun was only then just sinking in the western sky. There were but","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9347",10148,"three bedrooms in the place, and to the meanest of these the landlord","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9348",10148,"showed Robin Hood, but little Robin cared for the looks of the place,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9350",10148,"stripping off his clothes without more ado, he rolled into the bed and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9357",10148,"grim mutter of the coming thunder was heard. Then up rode four stout","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9358",10148,"burghers of Nottingham Town, for this was the only inn within five","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9360",10148,"thunderstorm as this that was coming upon them. Leaving their nags to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9370",10148,"and banging the doors and shutters, smelling of the coming rain, and all","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9371",10148,"wrapped in a cloud of dust and leaves. As though the wind had brought a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9372",10148,"guest along with it, the door opened of a sudden and in came a friar of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9373",10148,"Emmet Priory, and one in high degree, as was shown by the softness and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9374",10148,"sleekness of his robes and the richness of his rosary.  He called to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9375",10148,"landlord, and bade him first have his mule well fed and bedded in the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9376",10148,"stable, and then to bring him the very best there was in the house. So","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9377",10148,"presently a savory stew of tripe and onions, with sweet little fat","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9378",10148,"dumplings, was set before him, likewise a good stout pottle of Malmsey,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9379",10148,"and straightway the holy friar fell to with great courage and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9380",10148,"heartiness, so that in a short time nought was left but a little pool of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9381",10148,"gravy in the center of the platter, not large enow to keep the life in a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9384",10148,"In the meantime the storm broke.  Another gust of wind went rushing by,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9385",10148,"and with it fell a few heavy drops of rain, which presently came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9386",10148,"rattling down in showers, beating against the casements like a hundred","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9387",10148,"little hands. Bright flashes of lightning lit up every raindrop, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9388",10148,"with them came cracks of thunder that went away rumbling and bumping as","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9389",10148,"though Saint Swithin were busy rolling great casks of water across rough","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9394",10148,"At last the holy friar bade the landlord show him to his room; but when","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9395",10148,"he heard that he was to bed with a cobbler, he was as ill contented a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9396",10148,"fellow as you could find in all England, nevertheless there was nothing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9397",10148,"for it, and he must sleep there or nowhere; so, taking up his candle, he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9398",10148,"went off, grumbling like the now distant thunder. When he came to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9399",10148,"room where he was to sleep he held the light over Robin and looked at","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9400",10148,"him from top to toe; then he felt better pleased, for, instead, of a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9401",10148,"rough, dirty-bearded fellow, he beheld as fresh and clean a lad as one","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9402",10148,"could find in a week of Sundays; so, slipping off his clothes, he also","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9403",10148,"huddled into the bed, where Robin, grunting and grumbling in his sleep,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9404",10148,"made room for him. Robin was more sound asleep, I wot, than he had been","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9405",10148,"for many a day, else he would never have rested so quietly with one of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9406",10148,"the friar's sort so close beside him.  As for the friar, had he known","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9407",10148,"who Robin Hood was, you may well believe he would almost as soon have","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9408",10148,"slept with an adder as with the man he had for a bedfellow.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9409",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9410",10148,"So the night passed comfortably enough, but at the first dawn of day","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9411",10148,"Robin opened his eyes and turned his head upon the pillow. Then how he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9412",10148,"gaped and how he stared, for there beside him lay one all shaven and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9413",10148,"shorn, so that he knew that it must be a fellow in holy orders. He","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9414",10148,"pinched himself sharply, but, finding he was awake, sat up in bed, while","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9415",10148,"the other slumbered as peacefully as though he were safe and sound at","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9416",10148,"home in Emmet Priory.  ""Now,"" quoth Robin to himself, ""I wonder how this","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9417",10148,"thing hath dropped into my bed during the night."" So saying, he arose","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9418",10148,"softly, so as not to waken the other, and looking about the room he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9419",10148,"espied the friar's clothes lying upon a bench near the wall.  First he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9420",10148,"looked at the clothes, with his head on one side, and then he looked at","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9421",10148,"the friar and slowly winked one eye. Quoth he, ""Good Brother What-e'er-","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9422",10148,"thy-name-may-be, as thou hast borrowed my bed so freely I'll e'en borrow","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9423",10148,"thy clothes in return."" So saying, he straightway donned the holy man's","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9424",10148,"garb, but kindly left the cobbler's clothes in the place of it.  Then he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9425",10148,"went forth into the freshness of the morning, and the stableman that was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9426",10148,"up and about the stables opened his eyes as though he saw a green mouse","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9427",10148,"before him, for such men as the friars of Emmet were not wont to be","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9428",10148,"early risers; but the man bottled his thoughts, and only asked Robin","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9429",10148,"whether he wanted his mule brought from the stable.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9430",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9431",10148,"""Yea, my son,"" quoth Robin--albeit he knew nought of the mule--""and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9432",10148,"bring it forth quickly, I prythee, for I am late and must be jogging.""","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9433",10148,"So presently the stableman brought forth the mule, and Robin mounted it","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9434",10148,"and went on his way rejoicing.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9435",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9436",10148,"As for the holy friar, when he arose he was in as pretty a stew as any","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9437",10148,"man in all the world, for his rich, soft robes were gone, likewise his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9438",10148,"purse with ten golden pounds in it, and nought was left but patched","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9439",10148,"clothes and a leathern apron.  He raged and swore like any layman, but","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9440",10148,"as his swearing mended nothing and the landlord could not aid him, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9441",10148,"as, moreover, he was forced to be at Emmet Priory that very morning upon","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9442",10148,"matters of business, he was fain either to don the cobbler's clothes or","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9443",10148,"travel the road in nakedness. So he put on the clothes, and, still","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9444",10148,"raging and swearing vengeance against all the cobblers in Derbyshire, he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9445",10148,"set forth upon his way afoot; but his ills had not yet done with him,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9446",10148,"for he had not gone far ere he fell into the hands of the King's men,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9447",10148,"who marched him off, willy-nilly, to Tutbury Town and the Bishop of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9448",10148,"Hereford.  In vain he swore he was a holy man, and showed his shaven","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9449",10148,"crown; off he must go, for nothing would do but that he was Robin Hood.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9450",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9451",10148,"Meanwhile merry Robin rode along contentedly, passing safely by two","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9453",10148,"because of the nearness of Sherwood; so he traveled ever on to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9454",10148,"eastward, till, of a sudden, he met a noble knight in a shady lane. Then","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9455",10148,"Robin checked his mule quickly and leaped from off its back. ""Now, well","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9456",10148,"met, Sir Richard of the Lea,"" cried he, ""for rather than any other man","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9459",10148,"himself safe, being so nigh to Sherwood again. But when Robin had done,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9460",10148,"Sir Richard shook his head sadly. ""Thou art in greater danger now,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9462",10148,"the Sheriff's men blocking every road and letting none pass through the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9463",10148,"lines without examining them closely.  I myself know this, having passed","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9464",10148,"them but now. Before thee lie the Sheriffs men and behind thee the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9465",10148,"King's men, and thou canst not hope to pass either way, for by this time","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9470",10148,"Sir Richard bent his head in thought, and Robin felt his heart sink","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10935",10148,"he swore both loud and deep, and took a solemn vow that he would not","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10938",10148,"soldier as ever donned harness.  Sir William Dale was well acquainted","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10939",10148,"with Sherwood Forest, for he was head keeper over that part of it that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10940",10148,"lay nigh to good Mansfield Town; so to him the King turned, and bade him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10941",10148,"take an army of men and go straightway to seek Robin Hood.  Likewise the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10942",10148,"King gave Sir William his signet ring to show to the Sheriff, that he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10945",10148,"search for Robin Hood; and for seven days they hunted up and down, yet","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10950",10148,"had fought for years under King Richard, and was changed from what he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10955",10148,"first man slain in that fight was the Sheriff of Nottingham, for he fell","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10956",10148,"from his horse with an arrow in his brain ere half a score of shafts had","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10960",10148,"were left behind him, stretched out all stiff beneath the sweet green","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10965",10148,"seized upon him.  For three days it held him, and though he strove to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10966",10148,"fight it off, he was forced to yield at last. Thus it came that, on the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10967",10148,"morning of the fourth day, he called Little John to him, and told him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10968",10148,"that he could not shake the fever from him, and that he would go to his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10969",10148,"cousin, the prioress of the nunnery near Kirklees, in Yorkshire, who was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10970",10148,"a skillful leech, and he would have her open a vein in his arm and take","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10971",10148,"a little blood from him, for the bettering of his health.  Then he bade","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10972",10148,"Little John make ready to go also, for he might perchance need aid in","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10973",10148,"his journeying. So Little John and he took their leave of the others,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10974",10148,"and Robin Hood bade Will Stutely be the captain of the band until they","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10975",10148,"should come back. Thus they came by easy stages and slow journeying","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10984",10148,"should bring the King's wrath upon her also. Thus it happened that when","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10985",10148,"Robin came to her and told her how he wished her services as leech, she","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10987",10148,"to him she might find favor with his enemies. Nevertheless, she kept","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10988",10148,"this well to herself and received Robin with seeming kindness.  She led","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10989",10148,"him up the winding stone stair to a room which was just beneath the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10990",10148,"eaves of a high, round tower; but she would not let Little John come","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10992",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10993",10148,"So the poor yeoman turned his feet away from the door of the nunnery,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11001",10148,"Prioress sent all of the others away; then, taking a little cord, she","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11002",10148,"tied it tightly about Robin's arm, as though she were about to bleed","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11003",10148,"him.  And so she did bleed him, but the vein she opened was not one of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11004",10148,"those that lie close and blue beneath the skin; deeper she cut than","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11006",10148,"blood runs leaping from the heart. Of this Robin knew not; for, though","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11007",10148,"he saw the blood flow, it did not come fast enough to make him think","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11009",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11010",10148,"Having done this vile deed, the Prioress turned and left her cousin,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11013",10148,"to do so.  Again and again he called for help, but no help came, for his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11014",10148,"cousin had betrayed him, and Little John was too far away to hear his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11015",10148,"voice. So he bled and bled until he felt his strength slipping away from","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11017",10148,"his hands against the wall, he reached his bugle horn at last. Thrice he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11018",10148,"sounded it, but weakly and faintly, for his breath was fluttering","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11019",10148,"through sickness and loss of strength; nevertheless, Little John heard","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11021",10148,"came running and leaping toward the nunnery.  Loudly he knocked at the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11022",10148,"door, and in a loud voice shouted for them to let him in, but the door","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11023",10148,"was of massive oak, strongly barred, and studded with spikes, so they","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11024",10148,"felt safe, and bade Little John begone.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11028",10148,"mortar, such as three men could not lift nowadays.  Little John took","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11029",10148,"three steps forward, and, bending his back, heaved the stone mortar up","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11030",10148,"from where it stood deeply rooted.  Staggering under its weight, he came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11031",10148,"forward and hurled it crashing against the door.  In burst the door, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11032",10148,"away fled the frightened nuns, shrieking, at his coming. Then Little","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11037",10148,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11099",10148,"flew, his hand sank slowly with the bow till it lay across his knees,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11100",10148,"and his body likewise sank back again into Little John's loving arms;","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
