"163",10214,"animal, and the peculiarities, as the rational and irrational, will be","Introduction to the Philosophy and Writings of Plato","Taylor, Thomas","Philosophy","en"

"171",10214,"which its sensible, which is body with a particular quality, is motive of","Introduction to the Philosophy and Writings of Plato","Taylor, Thomas","Philosophy","en"
"172",10214,"sense. From hence it is evident that the thing which excites the sense is","Introduction to the Philosophy and Writings of Plato","Taylor, Thomas","Philosophy","en"
"173",10214,"something incorporeal. For if it was body, it would not yet be the object","Introduction to the Philosophy and Writings of Plato","Taylor, Thomas","Philosophy","en"
