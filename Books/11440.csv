"1348",11440,"and along the colonnades the people of that city walked with solemnity","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1349",11440,"and care according to the rites of ancient ceremony. All in that city","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1350",11440,"was of ancient device; the carving on the houses, which, when age had","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1351",11440,"broken it remained unrepaired, was of the remotest times, and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1352",11440,"everywhere were represented in stone beasts that have long since","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1353",11440,"passed away from Earth--the dragon, the griffin, and the hippogriffin,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1354",11440,"and the different species of gargoyle. Nothing was to be found,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1355",11440,"whether material or custom, that was new in Astahahn. Now they took no","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1356",11440,"notice at all of us as we went by, but continued their processions and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1357",11440,"ceremonies in the ancient city, and the sailors, knowing their custom,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1358",11440,"took no notice of them. But I called, as we came near, to one who","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1359",11440,"stood beside the water's edge, asking him what men did in Astahahn and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1360",11440,"what their merchandise was, and with whom they traded. He said, ""Here","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1361",11440,"we have fettered and manacled Time, who would otherwise slay the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1362",11440,"gods.""","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1363",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1364",11440,"I asked him what gods they worshipped in that city, and he said, ""All","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1365",11440,"those gods whom Time has not yet slain."" Then he turned from me and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1366",11440,"would say no more, but busied himself in behaving in accordance with","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1367",11440,"ancient custom. And so, according to the will of Yann, we drifted","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1368",11440,"onwards and left Astahahn, and we found in greater quantities such","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1369",11440,"birds as prey on fishes. And they were very wonderful in their","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1370",11440,"plumage, and they came not out of the jungle, but flew, with their","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1371",11440,"long necks stretched out before them, and their legs lying on the wind","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1372",11440,"behind straight up the river over the mid-stream.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1373",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1374",11440,"And now the evening began to gather in. A thick white mist had","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1375",11440,"appeared over the river, and was softly rising higher. It clutched at","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1376",11440,"the trees with long impalpable arms, it rose higher and higher,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1377",11440,"chilling the air; and white shapes moved away into the jungle as","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1378",11440,"though the ghosts of shipwrecked mariners were searching stealthily in","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1379",11440,"the darkness for the spirits of evil that long ago had wrecked them on","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1382",11440,"As the sun sank behind the field of orchids that grew on the matted","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1383",11440,"summit of the jungle, the river monsters came wallowing out of the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1384",11440,"slime in which they had reclined during the heat of the day, and the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1385",11440,"great beasts of the jungle came down to drink. The butterflies a while","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1386",11440,"since were gone to rest. In little narrow tributaries that we passed","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1387",11440,"night seemed already to have fallen, though the sun which had","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1388",11440,"disappeared from us had not yet set.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1389",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1390",11440,"And now the birds of the jungle came flying home far over us, with the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1391",11440,"sunlight glistening pink upon their breasts, and lowered their pinions","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1392",11440,"as soon as they saw the Yann, and dropped into the trees. And the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1393",11440,"widgeon began to go up the river in great companies, all whistling,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1394",11440,"and then would suddenly wheel and all go down again. And there shot by","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1395",11440,"us the small and arrow-like teal; and we heard the manifold cries of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1396",11440,"flocks of geese, which the sailors told me had recently come in from","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1397",11440,"crossing over the Lispasian ranges; every year they come by the same","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1398",11440,"way, close by the peak of Mluna, leaving it to the left, and the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1399",11440,"mountain eagles know the way they come and--men say--the very hour,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1400",11440,"and every year they expect them by the same way as soon as the snows","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1401",11440,"have fallen upon the Northern Plains. But soon it grew so dark that we","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1402",11440,"saw these birds no more, and only heard the whirring of their wings,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1403",11440,"and of countless others besides, until they all settled down along the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1404",11440,"banks of the river, and it was the hour when the birds of the night","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1405",11440,"went forth. Then the sailors lit the lanterns for the night, and huge","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1406",11440,"moths appeared, flapping about the ship, and at moments their gorgeous","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1407",11440,"colours would be revealed by the lanterns, then they would pass into","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1408",11440,"the night again, where all was black. And again the sailors prayed,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1409",11440,"and thereafter we supped and slept, and the helmsman took our lives","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1410",11440,"into his care.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1411",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1412",11440,"When I awoke I found that we had indeed come to Perdondaris, that","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1413",11440,"famous city. For there it stood upon the left of us, a city fair and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1414",11440,"notable, and all the more pleasant for our eyes to see after the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1415",11440,"jungle that was so long with us. And we were anchored by the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1416",11440,"marketplace, and the captain's merchandise was all displayed, and a","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1417",11440,"merchant of Perdondaris stood looking at it. And the captain had his","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1418",11440,"scimitar in his hand, and was beating with it in anger upon the deck,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1419",11440,"and the splinters were flying up from the white planks; for the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1420",11440,"merchant had offered him a price for his merchandise that the captain","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1421",11440,"declared to be an insult to himself and his country's gods, whom he","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1422",11440,"now said to be great and terrible gods, whose curses were to be","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1423",11440,"dreaded. But the merchant waved his hands, which were of great","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1424",11440,"fatness, showing his pink palms, and swore that of himself he thought","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1425",11440,"not at all, but only of the poor folk in the huts beyond the city to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1426",11440,"whom he wished to sell the merchandise for as low a price as possible,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1427",11440,"leaving no remuneration for himself. For the merchandise was mostly","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1428",11440,"the thick toomarund carpets that in the winter keep the wind from the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1429",11440,"floor, and tollub which the people smoke in pipes. Therefore the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1430",11440,"merchant said if he offered a piffek more the poor folk must go","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1431",11440,"without their toomarunds when the winter came, and without their","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1432",11440,"tollub in the evenings, or else he and his aged father must starve","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1433",11440,"together. Thereat the captain lifted his scimitar to his own throat,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1434",11440,"saying that he was now a ruined man, and that nothing remained to him","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1435",11440,"but death. And while he was carefully lifting he beard with his left","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1436",11440,"hand, the merchant eyed the merchandise again, and said that rather","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1437",11440,"than see so worthy a captain die, a man for whom he had conceived an","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1438",11440,"especial love when first he saw the manner in which he handled his","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1439",11440,"ship, he and his aged father should starve together and therefore he","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1440",11440,"offered fifteen piffeks more.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1441",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1442",11440,"When he said this the captain prostrated himself and prayed to his","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1443",11440,"gods that they might yet sweeten this merchant's bitter heart--to his","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1444",11440,"little lesser gods, to the gods that bless Belzoond.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1445",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1446",11440,"At last the merchant offered yet five piffeks more. Then the captain","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1447",11440,"wept, for he said that he was deserted of his gods; and the merchant","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1448",11440,"also wept, for he said that he was thinking of his aged father, and of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1449",11440,"how soon he would starve, and he hid his weeping face with both his","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1450",11440,"hands, and eyed the tollub again between his fingers. And so the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1451",11440,"bargain was concluded, and the merchant took the toomarund and tollub,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1452",11440,"paying for them out of a great clinking purse. And these were packed","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1453",11440,"up into bales again, and three of the merchant's slaves carried them","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1454",11440,"upon their heads into the city. And all the while the sailors had sat","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1455",11440,"silent, cross-legged in a crescent upon the deck, eagerly watching the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1456",11440,"bargain, and now a murmur of satisfaction arose among them, and they","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1457",11440,"began to compare it among themselves with other bargains that they had","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1458",11440,"known. And I found out from them that there are seven merchants in","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1459",11440,"Perdondaris, and that they had all come to the captain one by one","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1460",11440,"before the bargaining began, and each had warned him privately against","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1461",11440,"the others. And to all the merchants the captain had offered the wine","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1462",11440,"of his own country, that they make in fair Belzoond, but could in no","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1463",11440,"wise persuade them to it. But now that the bargain was over, and the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1464",11440,"sailors were seated at the first meal of the day, the captain appeared","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1465",11440,"among them with a cask of that wine, and we broached it with care and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1466",11440,"all made merry together. And the captain was glad in his heart because","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1467",11440,"he knew that he had much honour in the eyes of his men because of the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1468",11440,"bargain that he had made. So the sailors drank the wine of their","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1469",11440,"native land, and soon their thoughts were back in fair Belzoond and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1470",11440,"the little neighbouring cities of Durl and Duz.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1471",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1472",11440,"But for me the captain poured into a little glass some heavy yellow","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1473",11440,"wine from a small jar which he kept apart among his sacred things.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1474",11440,"Thick and sweet it was, even like honey, yet there was in its heart a","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1475",11440,"mighty, ardent fire which had authority over souls of men. It was","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1476",11440,"made, the captain told me, with great subtlety by the secret craft of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1477",11440,"a family of six who lived in a hut on the mountains of Hian Min. Once","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1478",11440,"in these mountains, he said, he followed the spoor of a bear, and he","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1479",11440,"came suddenly on a man of that family who had hunted the same bear,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1480",11440,"and he was at the end of a narrow way with precipice all about him,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1481",11440,"and his spear was sticking in the bear, and the wound not fatal, and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1482",11440,"he had no other weapon. And the bear was walking towards the man, very","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1483",11440,"slowly because his wound irked him--yet he was now very close. And","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1484",11440,"what the captain did he would not say, but every year as soon as the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1485",11440,"snows are hard, and travelling is easy on the Hian Min, that man comes","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1486",11440,"down to the market in the plains, and always leaves for the captain in","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1487",11440,"the gate of fair Belzoond a vessel of that priceless secret wine.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1488",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1489",11440,"And as I sipped the wine and the captain talked, I remembered me of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1490",11440,"stalwart noble things that I had long since resolutely planned, and my","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1491",11440,"soul seemed to grow mightier within me and to dominate the whole tide","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1492",11440,"of the Yann. It may be that I then slept. Or, if I did not, I do not","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1493",11440,"now minutely recollect every detail of that morning's occupations.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1494",11440,"Towards evening, I awoke and wishing to see Perdondaris before we left","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1495",11440,"in the morning, and being unable to wake the captain, I went ashore","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1496",11440,"alone. Certainly Perdondaris was a powerful city; it was encompassed","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1497",11440,"by a wall of great strength and altitude, having in it hollow ways for","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1498",11440,"troops to walk in, and battlements along it all the way, and fifteen","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1499",11440,"strong towers on it in every mile, and copper plaques low down where","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1500",11440,"men could read them, telling in all the languages of those parts of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1501",11440,"the Earth--one language on each plaque--the tale of how an army once","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1502",11440,"attacked Perdondaris and what befell that army. Then I entered","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1503",11440,"Perdondaris and found all the people dancing, clad in brilliant silks,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1504",11440,"and playing on the tam-bang as they danced. For a fearful thunderstorm","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1505",11440,"had terrified them while I slept, and the fires of death, they said,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1506",11440,"had danced over Perdondaris, and now the thunder had gone leaping away","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1507",11440,"large and black and hideous, they said, over the distant hills, and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1508",11440,"had turned round snarling at them, showing his gleaming teeth, and had","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1509",11440,"stamped, as he went, upon the hilltops until they rang as though they","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1510",11440,"had been bronze. And often and again they stopped in their merry","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1511",11440,"dances and prayed to the God they knew not, saying, ""O, God that we","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1512",11440,"know not, we thank Thee for sending the thunder back to his hills.""","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1513",11440,"And I went on and came to the market-place, and lying there upon the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1514",11440,"marble pavement I saw the merchant fast asleep and breathing heavily,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1515",11440,"with his face and the palms of his hands towards the sky, and slaves","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1516",11440,"were fanning him to keep away the flies. And from the market-place I","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1517",11440,"came to a silver temple and then to a palace of onyx, and there were","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1518",11440,"many wonders in Perdondaris, and I would have stayed and seen them","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1519",11440,"all, but as I came to the outer wall of the city I suddenly saw in it","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1520",11440,"a huge ivory gate. For a while I paused and admired it, then I came","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1521",11440,"nearer and perceived the dreadful truth. The gate was carved out of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1522",11440,"one solid piece!","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1523",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1524",11440,"I fled at once through the gateway and down to the ship, and even as I","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1525",11440,"ran I thought that I heard far off on the hills behind me the tramp of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2092",11440,"wondered what befell Singanee, for there was a stillness about his","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2103",11440,"He had no information to give me about the old man--he was sufficient","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2108",11440,"began to praise it.  I asked him what was the use of it, and he said","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2109",11440,"that it was of no use but that it had only been invented a week ago","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2323",11440,"ruffling up the edge of the skirts of night, then Saranoora the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2324",11440,"princess of the North led me out into a garden.  Dark groves of trees","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2325",11440,"were there which filled the night with perfume and guarded night's","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2326",11440,"mysteries from the arising dawn.  There floated over us, wandering in","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2327",11440,"that garden, the triumphant melody of those dark musicians, whose","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2328",11440,"origin was unguessed even by those that dwelt there and knew the Lands","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2330",11440,"festival of that night had scared him and he was silent.  For only a","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2331",11440,"moment once we heard him singing in some far grove because the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2332",11440,"musicians rested and our bare feet made no sound; for a moment we","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2333",11440,"heard that bird of which once our nightingale dreamed and handed on","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2334",11440,"the tradition to his children.  And Saranoora told me that they have","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2335",11440,"named the bird the Sister of Song; but for the musicians, who","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2336",11440,"presently played again, she said they had no name, for no one knew who","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2337",11440,"they were or from what country.  Then some one sang quite near us in","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2338",11440,"the darkness to an instrument of strings telling of Singanee and his","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2339",11440,"battle against the monster.  And soon we saw him sitting on the ground","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2340",11440,"and singing to the night of that spear-thrust that had found the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2341",11440,"thumping heart of the destroyer of Perdondaris; and we stopped awhile","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2342",11440,"and asked him who had seen so memorable a struggle and he answered","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2343",11440,"none but Singanee and he whose tusk had scattered Perdondaris, and now","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2344",11440,"the last was dead.  And when we asked him if Singanee had told him of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2345",11440,"the struggle he said that that proud hunter would say no word about it","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2346",11440,"and that therefore his mighty deed was given to the poets and become","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2347",11440,"their trust forever, and he struck again his instrument of strings and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2348",11440,"sang on.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2350",11440,"When the strings of pearls that hung down from her neck began to gleam","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2351",11440,"all over Saranoora I knew that dawn was near and that that memorable","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2352",11440,"night was all but gone.  And at last we left the garden and came to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2353",11440,"the abyss to see the sunrise shine on the amethyst cliff. And at first","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2354",11440,"it lit up the beauty of Saranoora and then it topped the world and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2355",11440,"blazed upon those cliffs of amethyst until it dazzled our eyes, and we","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2356",11440,"turned from it and saw the workman going out along the tusk to hollow","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2358",11440,"who had drunken bak began to awake and to open their dazzled eyes at","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2359",11440,"the amethyst precipice and to rub them and turn them away.  And now","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2360",11440,"those wonderful kingdoms of song that the dark musicians established","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2361",11440,"all night by magical chords dropped back again to the sway of that","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2362",11440,"ancient silence who ruled before the gods, and the musicians wrapped","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2363",11440,"their cloaks about them and covered up their marvellous instruments","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2364",11440,"and stole away to the plains; and no one dared ask them whither they","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2365",11440,"went or why they dwelt there, or what god they served.  And the dance","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2366",11440,"stopped and all the queens departed.  And then the female slave came","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2367",11440,"out again by a door and emptied her basket of sapphires down the abyss","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2368",11440,"as I saw her do before.  Beautiful Saranoora said that those great","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2370",11440,"day at noon a merchant from the mountains sold new ones for that","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2371",11440,"evening.  Yet I suspected that something more than extravagance lay at","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2372",11440,"the back of that seemingly wasteful act of tossing sapphires into an","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2373",11440,"abyss, for thee were in the depths of it those two dragons of gold of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2374",11440,"whom nothing seemed to be known.  And I thought, and I think so still,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2375",11440,"that Singanee, terrific though he was in war with the elephants, from","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2376",11440,"whose tusks he had built his palace, well knew and even feared those","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2377",11440,"dragons in the abyss, and perhaps valued those priceless jewels less","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2378",11440,"than he valued his queens, and that he to whom so many lands paid","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2379",11440,"beautiful tribute out of their dread of his spear, himself paid","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2380",11440,"tribute to the golden dragons. Whether those dragons had wings I could","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2381",11440,"not see; nor, if they had, could I tell if they could bear that weight","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2382",11440,"of solid gold from the abyss; nor by what paths they could crawl from","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2384",11440,"sapphires be or a queen. Only it seemed strange to me that so much","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2385",11440,"wealth of jewels should be thrown by command of a man who had nothing","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2386",11440,"to fear--to fall flashing and changing their colours at dawn into an","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2388",11440,"","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2389",11440,"I do not know how long we lingered there watching the sunrise on those","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2394",11440,"the daylight in the solitary sapphire that Saranoora had and that she","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2395",11440,"wore upon her finger in a ring.  Then, the dawn wind being all about","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2396",11440,"her, she said that she was cold and turned back into the ivory palace.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2397",11440,"And I feared that we might never meet again, for time moves","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2398",11440,"differently over the Lands of Dream than over the fields we know; like","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2399",11440,"ocean-currents going different ways and bearing drifting ships.  And","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2400",11440,"at the doorway of the ivory palace I turned to say farewell and yet I","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2401",11440,"found no words that were suitable to say.  And often now when I stand","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2402",11440,"in other lands I stop and think of many things to have said; yet all I","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2403",11440,"said was ""Perhaps we shall meet again.""  And she said that it was","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2404",11440,"likely that we should often meet for that this was a little thing for","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2405",11440,"the gods to permit not knowing that the gods of the Lands of Dream","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2406",11440,"have little power upon the fields we know.  Then she went in through","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2407",11440,"the doorway. And having exchanged for my own clothes again the raiment","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2408",11440,"that the chamberlain had given me I turned from the hospitality of","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2409",11440,"mighty Singanee and set my face towards the fields we know.  I crossed","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2410",11440,"that enormous tusk that had been the end of Perdondaris and met the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2411",11440,"artists carving it as I went; and some by way of greeting as I passed","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2412",11440,"extolled Singanee, and in answer I gave honour to his name.  Daylight","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2413",11440,"had not yet penetrated wholly to the bottom of the abyss but the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2414",11440,"darkness was giving place to a purple haze and I could faintly see one","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2415",11440,"golden dragon there. Then looking once towards the ivory palace, and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2416",11440,"seeing no one at the windows, I turned sorrowfully away, and going by","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2417",11440,"the way that I knew passed through the gap in the mountains and down","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2418",11440,"their slopes till I came again in sight of the witch's cottage.  And","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2419",11440,"as I went to the upper window to look for the fields we know, the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2420",11440,"witch spoke to me; but I was cross, as one newly waked from sleep, and","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2421",11440,"I would not answer her. Then the cat questioned me as to whom I had","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2422",11440,"met, and I answered him that in the fields we know cats kept their","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2423",11440,"place and did not speak to man.  And then I came downstairs and walked","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2424",11440,"straight out of the door, heading for Go-by Street.  ""You are going","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2425",11440,"the wrong way,"" the witch called through the window; and indeed I had","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2426",11440,"sooner gone back to the ivory palace again, but I had no right to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2427",11440,"trespass any further on the hospitality of Singanee and one cannot","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2428",11440,"stay always in the Lands of Dream, and what knowledge had that old","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2430",11440,"snares that bind our feet therein? So I paid no heed to her, but kept","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2431",11440,"on, and came to Go-by Street.  I saw the house with the green door","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2432",11440,"some way up the street but thinking that the near end of the street","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2433",11440,"was closer to the Embankment where I had left my boat I tried the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2434",11440,"first door I came to, a cottage thatched like the rest, with little","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2435",11440,"golden spires along the roof-ridge, and strange birds sitting there","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2436",11440,"and preening marvellous feathers.  The door opened, and to my surprise","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2437",11440,"I found myself in what seemed like a shepherd's cottage; a man who was","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2438",11440,"sitting on a log of wood in a little low dark room said something to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2439",11440,"me in an alien language.  I muttered something and hurried through to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2440",11440,"the street. The house was thatched in front as well as behind.  There","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2441",11440,"were not golden spires in front, no marvellous birds; but there was no","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2442",11440,"pavement.  There was a row of houses, byres, and barns but no other","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2443",11440,"sign of a town.  Far off I saw one or two little villages.  Yet there","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2444",11440,"was the river--and no doubt the Thames, for it was the width of the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2445",11440,"Thames and had the curves of it, if you can imagine the Thames in that","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2446",11440,"particular spot without a city around it, without any bridges, and the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2447",11440,"Embankment fallen in.  I saw that there had happened to me permanently","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2455",11440,"the man who led them had a wild, strange look.  I spoke to him and he","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2456",11440,"did not understand me.  Then I went down to the river to see if my","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2457",11440,"boat was there and at the very spot where I had left it, in the mud","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2458",11440,"(for the tide was low) I saw a half-buried piece of blackened wood","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2459",11440,"that might have been part of a boat, but I could not tell.  I began to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2460",11440,"feel that I had missed the world.  It would be a strange thing to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2461",11440,"travel from far away to see London and not be able to find it among","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2462",11440,"all the roads that lead there, but I seemed to have travelled in Time","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2463",11440,"and to have missed it among the centuries.  And when as I wandered","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2464",11440,"over the grassy hills I came on a wattled shrine that was thatched","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2465",11440,"with straw and saw a lion in it more worn with time than even the","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2468",11440,"centuries of treacherous years between me and anything that I had","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2469",11440,"known.  And then I sat on the grass by the worn paws of the lion to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2470",11440,"think out what to do.  And I decided to go back through Go-by Street","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2471",11440,"and, since there was nothing left to keep me any more to the fields we","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2472",11440,"know, to offer myself as a servant in the palace of Singanee, and to","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2473",11440,"see again the face of Saranoora and those famous, wonderful,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2474",11440,"amethystine dawns upon the abyss where the golden dragons play.  And I","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2475",11440,"stayed no longer to look for remains of the ruins of London; for there","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2476",11440,"is little pleasure in seeing wonderful things if there is no one at","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2477",11440,"all to hear of them and to wonder.  So I returned at once to Go-by","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2478",11440,"Street, the little row of huts, and saw no other record that London","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2479",11440,"had been except that one stone lion.  I went to the right house this","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2480",11440,"time.  It was very much altered and more like one of those huts that","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2481",11440,"one sees on Salisbury plain than a shop in the city of London, but I","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2482",11440,"found it by counting the houses in the street for it was still a row","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2483",11440,"of houses though pavement and city were gone. And it was still a shop.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2484",11440,"A very different shop to the one I knew, but things were for sale","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2485",11440,"there--shepherd's crooks, food, and rude axes.  And a man with long","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2486",11440,"hair was there who was clad in skins. I did not speak to him for I did","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2487",11440,"not know his language. He said to me something that sounded like","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2488",11440,"""Everkike.""  It conveyed no meaning to me; but when he looked towards","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2489",11440,"one of his buns, light suddenly dawned in my mind, and I knew that","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2490",11440,"England was even England still and that still she was not conquered,","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2491",11440,"and that though they had tired of London they still held to their","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2492",11440,"land; for the words that the man had said were, ""Av er kike,"" and then","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2493",11440,"I knew that that very language that was carried to distant lands by","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2500",11440,"remembered how far away I was.  I think I was silent for a little","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2501",11440,"while.  Suddenly I saw that the man who kept the shop was asleep.","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2502",11440,"That habit was strangely like the ways of a man who if he were then","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2504",11440,"over a thousand years old.  But then how old was I?  It is perfectly","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2505",11440,"clear that Time moves over the Lands of Dream swifter or slower than","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"2511",11440,"backdoor--I went to the far end of his wattled shop.  There was a door","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"2512",11440,"of a sort on leather hinges.  I pushed it open and there I was again","Tales of Three Hemispheres","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
