"1165",12747,"take such as they had been told of; they chose to view the land first.","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1212",12747,"ending, that Ufeigh fell before Thorbiorn in Grettir's-Gill, near","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1213",12747,"Heel. There were many drawn together to the sons of Ufeigh concerning","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1214",12747,"the blood-suit, and Onund Treefoot was sent for, and rode south in","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1215",12747,"the spring, and guested at Hvamm, with Aud the Deeply-wealthy, and","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1216",12747,"she gave him exceeding good welcome, because he had been with her west","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1217",12747,"over the Sea. In those days, Olaf Feilan, her son's son, was a man","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1218",12747,"full grown, and Aud was by then worn with great eld; she bade Onund","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1219",12747,"know that she would have Olaf, her kinsman, married, and was fain that","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1220",12747,"he should woo Aldis of Barra, who was cousin to Asa, whom Onund had to","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1221",12747,"wife. Onund deemed the matter hopeful, and Olaf rode south with him.","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1222",12747,"So when Onund met his friends and kin-in-law they bade him abide with","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1223",12747,"them: then was the suit talked over, and was laid to Kialarnes Thing,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1224",12747,"for as then the Althing was not yet set up. So the case was settled","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1225",12747,"by umpiredom, and heavy weregild came for the slayings, and Thorbiorn","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1226",12747,"Earl's-champion was outlawed. His son was Solmund, the father of Kari","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1230",12747,"they backed Olaf's wooing, which was settled with ease, because men","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1231",12747,"knew how mighty a woman Aud was. So the bargain was made, and, so much","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1232",12747,"being done, Onund rode home, and Aud thanked him well for his help to","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1242",12747,"Onund and Asa had two sons; the elder was called Thorgeir, the younger","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1243",12747,"Ufeigh Grettir; but Asa soon died. Thereafter Onund got to wife a","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1244",12747,"woman called Thordis, the daughter of Thorgrim, from Gnup in Midfirth,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1245",12747,"and akin to Midfirth Skeggi. Of her Onund had a son called Thorgrim;","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1246",12747,"he was early a big man, and a strong, wise, and good withal in matters","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1247",12747,"of husbandry. Onund dwelt on at Coldback till he was old, then he died","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1248",12747,"in his bed, and is buried in Treefoot's barrow; he was the briskest","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1249",12747,"and lithest of one-footed men who have ever lived in Iceland.","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1250",12747,"","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1251",12747,"Now Thorgrim took the lead among the sons of Onund, though others of","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1252",12747,"them were older than he; but when he was twenty-five years old he","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1253",12747,"grew grey-haired, and therefore was he bynamed Greypate; Thordis, his","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1254",12747,"mother, was afterwards wedded north in Willowdale, to Audun Skokul,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1255",12747,"and their son was Asgeir, of Asgeir's-River. Thorgrim Greypate and","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1256",12747,"his brothers had great possessions in common, nor did they divide the","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1257",12747,"goods between them. Now Eric, who farmed at Arness, as is aforesaid,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1258",12747,"had to wife Alof, daughter of Ingolf, of Ingolfs-firth; and Flosi was","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1259",12747,"the name of their son, a hopeful man, and of many friends. In those","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1260",12747,"days three brothers came out hither, Ingolf, Ufeigh, and Eyvind, and","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1261",12747,"settled those three firths that are known by their names, and there","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1262",12747,"dwelt afterwards. Olaf was the name of Eyvind's son, he first dwelt","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1263",12747,"at Eyvind's-firth, and after at Drangar, and was a man to hold his own","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1265",12747,"","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1266",12747,"Now there was no strife betwixt these men while their elders were","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1267",12747,"alive; but when Eric died, it seemed to Flosi, that those of Coldback","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1268",12747,"had no lawful title to the lands which Eric had given to Onund; and","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1269",12747,"from this befell much ill-blood betwixt them; but Thorgrim and his","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1270",12747,"kin still held their lands as before, but they might not risk having","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1271",12747,"sports together. Now Thorgeir was head-man of the household of those","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1272",12747,"brothers in Reekfirth, and would ever be rowing out a-fishing, because","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1273",12747,"in those days were the firths full of fish; so those in the Creek","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1274",12747,"made up their plot; a man there was, a house-carle of Flosi in Arness,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1275",12747,"called Thorfin, him Flosi sent for Thorgeir's head, and he went and","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1276",12747,"hid himself in the boat-stand; that morning, Thorgeir got ready to row","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1277",12747,"out to sea, and two men with him, one called Hamund, the other Brand.","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1278",12747,"Thorgeir went first, and had on his back a leather bottle and drink","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1280",12747,"Thorfin ran at him, and smote him with an axe betwixt the shoulders,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1281",12747,"and the axe sank in, and the bottle squeaked, but he let go the axe,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1282",12747,"for he deemed that there would be little need of binding up, and would","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1283",12747,"save himself as swiftly as might be; and it is to be told of him that","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1284",12747,"he ran off to Arness, and came there before broad day, and told of","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1285",12747,"Thorgeir's slaying, and said that he should have need of Flosi's","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1604",12747,"will not go out on grazing. At such times thou shalt lock the horses","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1611",12747,"","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1612",12747,"Now Grettir took to the horse-watching, and so the time went on till","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1613",12747,"past Yule-time; then came on much cold weather with snow, that made","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1614",12747,"grazing hard to come at. Now Grettir was ill clad, and as yet little","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1615",12747,"hardened, and he began to be starved by the cold; but Keingala grazed","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1616",12747,"away in the windiest place she could find, let the weather be as rough","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1617",12747,"as it would. Early as she might go to the pasture, never would she go","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1618",12747,"back to stable before nightfall. Now Grettir deemed that he must think","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1619",12747,"of some scurvy trick or other, that Keingala might be paid in full","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1620",12747,"for her way of grazing: so, one morning early, he comes to the","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1621",12747,"horse-stable, opens it, and finds Keingala standing all along before","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1622",12747,"the crib; for, whatever food was given to the horses with her, it was","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1623",12747,"her way to get it all to herself. Grettir got on her back, and had a","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1624",12747,"sharp knife in his hand, and drew it right across Keingala's shoulder,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1625",12747,"and then all along both sides of the back. Thereat the mare, being","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1626",12747,"both fat and shy, gave a mad bound, and kicked so fiercely, that her","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1627",12747,"hooves clattered against the wall. Grettir fell off; but, getting","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1628",12747,"on his legs, strove to mount her again. Now their struggle is of the","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1629",12747,"sharpest, but the end of it is, that he flays off the whole of the","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1630",12747,"strip along the back to the loins. Thereafter he drove the horses out","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1631",12747,"on grazing; Keingala would bite but at her back, and when noon was","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1632",12747,"barely past, she started off, and ran back to the house. Grettir now","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1633",12747,"locks the stable and goes home. Asmund asked Grettir where the horses","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1634",12747,"were. He said that he had stabled them as he was wont. Asmund said","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2688",12747,"a man of rash temper, of good birth, and somewhat akin to Thorkel; he","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2689",12747,"was not well loved of men, for he would slander much those who were","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2690",12747,"with Thorkel, and in this wise he sent many away. Grettir and he","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2691",12747,"had little to do together; Biorn thought him of little worth weighed","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2692",12747,"against himself, but Grettir was unyielding, so that things fell","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2693",12747,"athwart between them. Biorn was a mightily boisterous man, and made","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2694",12747,"himself very big; many young men gat into fellowship with him in these","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2698",12747,"by the noise that Biorn and his fellows had made. The brute got so","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2699",12747,"hard to deal with that he tore down the herds of men, and Thorkel","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2703",12747,"Now one day Thorkel bade his men to follow him, and search for the","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2704",12747,"lair of the bear. They found it in sheer sea-rocks; there was a high","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2705",12747,"rock and a cave before it down below, but only one track to go up to","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2720",12747,"that the beast was there before him, and roaring savagely. Biorn lay","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2722",12747,"till the beast should stir abroad as his manner was. Now the bear had","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2724",12747,"very sleepy where he lay, and cannot wake up, and just at this time","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2734",12747,"was Grettir and Biorn and other followers of Thorkel. Grettir had on","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2735",12747,"a fur-cloak, which he laid aside while they set on the beast. It was","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2737",12747,"spear-thrusts, and all the spear-points the bear turned off him with","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2739",12747,"went not so nigh as to run the risk of any hurt. Amid this, when men","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2771",12747,"He went up into the pass forthwith, and when the beast saw a man, it","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2783",12747,"heaviest of the two, and came down first upon the stone heap below,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2784",12747,"Grettir being the uppermost, and the beast was much mangled on its","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3606",12747,"early to leave Meals; Gamli offered him men to go with him. Now Grim","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3607",12747,"was the name of Gamli's brother; he was of all men the swiftest; he","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3608",12747,"rode with Grettir with another man; they were five in all. Thus they","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3609",12747,"rode on till they came to Ramfirth-neck, west of Bowerfell. There","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3610",12747,"stands a huge stone that is called Grettir's heave; for he tried long","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3611",12747,"that day to lift that stone, and thus they delayed till Kormak and his","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3612",12747,"fellows were come. Grettir rode to meet them, and both sides jumped","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3613",12747,"off their horses. Grettir said it was more like free men now to","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3614",12747,"deal blows of the biggest, than to fight with staves like wandering","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3615",12747,"churles. Then Kormak bade them take the challenge in manly wise, and","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3616",12747,"do their best. Thereafter they ran at one another and fought. Grettir","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3617",12747,"went before his men, and bade them take heed, that none came at his","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3624",12747,"his men to go between them. But the others were by then so eager that","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3625",12747,"they could do nought. Grettir broke forth fiercely, and before him","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3626",12747,"were the sons of Thorir, and they both fell as he thrust them from","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3627",12747,"him; they waxed exceeding furious thereat, insomuch that Gunnar dealt","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3628",12747,"a death-blow at a house-carle of Atli; and when Thorbiorn saw that,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3629",12747,"he bade them part, saying withal that he would aid which side soever","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3630",12747,"should pay heed to his words. By then were fallen two house-carles of","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3632",12747,"bring aid to them against him, wherefore now he gave up the battle,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3633",12747,"and all were wounded who had been at that meeting. But much it","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6784",12747,"hill-sides grass-grown and set with bushes. Hot springs there were","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6785",12747,"therein, and it seemed to him that it was by reason of earth-fires","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6790",12747,"scarcely tell over the sheep that were in that valley, so many they","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6792",12747,"","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6793",12747,"Now Grettir abode there, and made himself a hut of such wood as he","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6795",12747,"on one of them than on two elsewhere: one ewe there was, brown with a","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6796",12747,"polled head, with her lamb, that he deemed the greatest beauty for","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6798",12747,"thereafter slaughtered it: three stone of suet there was in it, but","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6799",12747,"the whole carcase was even better. But when Brownhead missed her lamb,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6800",12747,"she went up on Grettir's hut every night, and bleated in suchwise that","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6801",12747,"he might not sleep anight, so that it misliked him above all things","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6804",12747,"But every evening at twilight he heard some one hoot up in the valley,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"10159",12747,"was indisputably for all reasons the greatest of Icelandic outlaws,","The Story of Grettir the Strong",NA,"Fantasy","en"
