"34",1460,"As I may, without vanity, presume that the name and official description","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"35",1460,"prefixed to this Proem will secure it, from the sedate and reflecting","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"37",1460,"such attention as is due to the sedulous instructor of youth, and the","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"40",1460,"recommendations of my labours which they must necessarily anticipate","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"41",1460,"from the perusal of the title-page. Nevertheless, I am not unaware,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"42",1460,"that, as Envy always dogs Merit at the heels, there may be those who","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"43",1460,"will whisper, that albeit my learning and good principles cannot","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"44",1460,"(lauded be the heavens) be denied by any one, yet that my situation at","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"45",1460,"Gandercleugh hath been more favourable to my acquisitions in learning","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"46",1460,"than to the enlargement of my views of the ways and works of the present","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"47",1460,"generation. To the which objection, if, peradventure, any such shall be","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"48",1460,"started, my answer shall be threefold:","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"49",1460,"","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"50",1460,"First, Gandercleugh is, as it were, the central part--the navel (SI","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"51",1460,"FAS SIT DICERE) of this our native realm of Scotland; so that men, from","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"52",1460,"every corner thereof, when travelling on their concernments of business,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"53",1460,"either towards our metropolis of law, by which I mean Edinburgh, or","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"54",1460,"towards our metropolis and mart of gain, whereby I insinuate Glasgow,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"55",1460,"are frequently led to make Gandercleugh their abiding stage and place of","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"56",1460,"rest for the night. And it must be acknowledged by the most sceptical,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"57",1460,"that I, who have sat in the leathern armchair, on the left-hand side of","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"58",1460,"the fire, in the common room of the Wallace Inn, winter and summer,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"59",1460,"for every evening in my life, during forty years bypast (the Christian","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"60",1460,"Sabbaths only excepted), must have seen more of the manners and customs","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"61",1460,"of various tribes and people, than if I had sought them out by my","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"62",1460,"own painful travel and bodily labour. Even so doth the tollman at the","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"63",1460,"well-frequented turn-pike on the Wellbraehead, sitting at his ease in","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"64",1460,"his own dwelling, gather more receipt of custom, than if, moving forth","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"65",1460,"upon the road, he were to require a contribution from each person whom","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"66",1460,"he chanced to meet in his journey, when, according to the vulgar adage,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"67",1460,"he might possibly be greeted with more kicks than halfpence.","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"68",1460,"","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"69",1460,"But, secondly, supposing it again urged, that Ithacus, the most wise of","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"70",1460,"the Greeks, acquired his renown, as the Roman poet hath assured us, by","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"71",1460,"visiting states and men, I reply to the Zoilus who shall adhere to this","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"72",1460,"objection, that, DE FACTO, I have seen states and men also; for I have","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"73",1460,"visited the famous cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, the former twice,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"74",1460,"and the latter three times, in the course of my earthly pilgrimage. And,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"75",1460,"moreover, I had the honour to sit in the General Assembly (meaning, as","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"76",1460,"an auditor, in the galleries thereof), and have heard as much goodly","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"77",1460,"speaking on the law of patronage, as, with the fructification thereof","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"78",1460,"in mine own understanding, hath made me be considered as an oracle upon","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"79",1460,"that doctrine ever since my safe and happy return to Gandercleugh.","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"80",1460,"","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"81",1460,"Again--and thirdly, If it be nevertheless pretended that my information","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"82",1460,"and knowledge of mankind, however extensive, and however painfully","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"83",1460,"acquired, by constant domestic enquiry, and by foreign travel, is,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"84",1460,"natheless, incompetent to the task of recording the pleasant narratives","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"85",1460,"of my Landlord, I will let these critics know, to their own eternal","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"86",1460,"shame and confusion as well as to the abashment and discomfiture of all","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"87",1460,"who shall rashly take up a song against me, that I am NOT the writer,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"88",1460,"redacter, or compiler, of the Tales of my Landlord; nor am I, in one","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"89",1460,"single iota, answerable for their contents, more or less. And now, ye","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"90",1460,"generation of critics, who raise yourselves up as if it were brazen","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"91",1460,"serpents, to hiss with your tongues, and to smite with your stings, bow","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"92",1460,"yourselves down to your native dust, and acknowledge that yours have","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"93",1460,"been the thoughts of ignorance, and the words of vain foolishness. Lo!","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"94",1460,"ye are caught in your own snare, and your own pit hath yawned for you.","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"95",1460,"Turn, then, aside from the task that is too heavy for you; destroy","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"96",1460,"not your teeth by gnawing a file; waste not your strength by spurning","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"97",1460,"against a castle wall; nor spend your breath in contending in swiftness","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"98",1460,"with a fleet steed; and let those weigh the Tales of my Landlord, who","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"99",1460,"shall bring with them the scales of candour cleansed from the rust of","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"100",1460,"prejudice by the hands of intelligent modesty. For these alone they were","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"101",1460,"compiled, as will appear from a brief narrative which my zeal for truth","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"102",1460,"compelled me to make supplementary to the present Proem.","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"103",1460,"","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"104",1460,"It is well known that my Landlord was a pleasing and a facetious man,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"106",1460,"Laird, the Exciseman, and those for whom he refused to draw liquor upon","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"107",1460,"trust. Their causes of dislike I will touch separately, adding my own","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"108",1460,"refutation thereof.","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"109",1460,"","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"110",1460,"His honour, the Laird, accused our Landlord, deceased, of having","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"111",1460,"encouraged, in various times and places, the destruction of hares,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"112",1460,"rabbits, fowls black and grey, partridges, moor-pouts, roe-deer, and","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"113",1460,"other birds and quadrupeds, at unlawful seasons, and contrary to the","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"114",1460,"laws of this realm, which have secured, in their wisdom, the slaughter","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"115",1460,"of such animals for the great of the earth, whom I have remarked to take","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"116",1460,"an uncommon (though to me, an unintelligible) pleasure therein. Now, in","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"117",1460,"humble deference to his honour, and in justifiable defence of my friend","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"118",1460,"deceased, I reply to this charge, that howsoever the form of such","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"119",1460,"animals might appear to be similar to those so protected by the law, yet","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"120",1460,"it was a mere DECEPTIO VISUS; for what resembled hares were, in fact,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"121",1460,"HILL-KIDS, and those partaking of the appearance of moor-fowl, were","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"122",1460,"truly WOOD PIGEONS and consumed and eaten EO NOMINE, and not otherwise.","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"123",1460,"","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"124",1460,"Again, the Exciseman pretended, that my deceased Landlord did encourage","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"125",1460,"that species of manufacture called distillation, without having an","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"126",1460,"especial permission from the Great, technically called a license, for","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"127",1460,"doing so. Now, I stand up to confront this falsehood; and in defiance","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"128",1460,"of him, his gauging-stick, and pen and inkhorn, I tell him, that I","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"129",1460,"never saw, or tasted, a glass of unlawful aqua vitae in the house of","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"130",1460,"my Landlord; nay, that, on the contrary, we needed not such devices, in","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"131",1460,"respect of a pleasing and somewhat seductive liquor, which was vended","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"132",1460,"and consumed at the Wallace Inn, under the name of MOUNTAIN DEW. If","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"133",1460,"there is a penalty against manufacturing such a liquor, let him show me","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"134",1460,"the statute; and when he does, I'll tell him if I will obey it or no.","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"135",1460,"","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"138",1460,"has grieved my bowels as if the case had been mine own. Nevertheless, my","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"139",1460,"Landlord considered the necessities of a thirsty soul, and would permit","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"141",1460,"of moisture, to drink to the full value of their watches and wearing","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"142",1460,"apparel, exclusively of their inferior habiliments, which he was","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"143",1460,"uniformly inexorable in obliging them to retain, for the credit of the","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"144",1460,"house. As to mine own part, I may well say, that he never refused me","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"145",1460,"that modicum of refreshment with which I am wont to recruit nature after","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"146",1460,"the fatigues of my school. It is true, I taught his five sons English","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"148",1460,"that I instructed his daughter in psalmody. Nor do I remember me of","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"149",1460,"any fee or HONORARIUM received from him on account of these my labours,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"150",1460,"except the compotations aforesaid. Nevertheless this compensation suited","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"151",1460,"my humour well, since it is a hard sentence to bid a dry throat wait","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"155",1460,"Landlord was chiefly moved to waive in my behalf the usual requisition","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"3816",1460,"being much embarrassed by his earlier extravagance, he went to England,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"3817",1460,"where he was understood to have formed a very advantageous matrimonial","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"3818",1460,"connexion. He was many years absent from his family estate. Suddenly and","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"3819",1460,"unexpectedly he returned a widower, bringing with him his daughter,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"3820",1460,"then a girl of about ten years old. From this moment his expense","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"3821",1460,"seemed unbounded, in the eyes of the simple inhabitants of his native","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"3822",1460,"mountains. It was supposed he must necessarily have plunged himself","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"3823",1460,"deeply in debt. Yet he continued to live in the same lavish expense,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"3834",1460,"appeared uncommonly well versed in all its forms. With others he held","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"3835",1460,"little communication; but in any casual intercourse, or conversation,","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"5879",1460,"of his fortune, I account it a full atonement. I am aware he has never","The Black Dwarf","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
