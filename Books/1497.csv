"637",1497,"justice into two unconnected precepts, which have no common principle,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"644",1497,"act does something to somebody; and following this analogy, Socrates","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"649",1497,"of justice? The answer is that justice is of use in contracts, and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"650",1497,"contracts are money partnerships. Yes; but how in such partnerships","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"651",1497,"is the just man of more use than any other man? 'When you want to have","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"652",1497,"money safely kept and not used.' Then justice will be useful when money","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"653",1497,"is useless. And there is another difficulty: justice, like the art of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"654",1497,"war or any other art, must be of opposites, good at attack as well as","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"655",1497,"at defence, at stealing as well as at guarding. But then justice is a","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"656",1497,"thief, though a hero notwithstanding, like Autolycus, the Homeric hero,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"661",1497,"as real or seeming; enemies as real or seeming? And are our friends to","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"662",1497,"be only the good, and our enemies to be the evil? The answer is, that","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"1578",1497,"music, and will now make a purgation of metres. These should be like the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"3725",1497,"while in the other the mind acquiesces. Now the stimulating class are","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5092",1497,"This is our first proof. The second is derived from the three kinds","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5093",1497,"of pleasure, which answer to the three elements of the soul--reason,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5094",1497,"passion, desire; under which last is comprehended avarice as well as","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5095",1497,"sensual appetite, while passion includes ambition, party-feeling, love","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5096",1497,"of reputation. Reason, again, is solely directed to the attainment of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5097",1497,"truth, and careless of money and reputation. In accordance with the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5098",1497,"difference of men's natures, one of these three principles is in the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5100",1497,"Interrogate now the three natures, and each one will be found praising","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5101",1497,"his own pleasures and depreciating those of others. The money-maker will","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5102",1497,"contrast the vanity of knowledge with the solid advantages of wealth.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5103",1497,"The ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no honour; whereas","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5104",1497,"the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth, and will call","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5105",1497,"other pleasures necessary rather than good. Now, how shall we decide","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5106",1497,"between them? Is there any better criterion than experience and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5107",1497,"knowledge? And which of the three has the truest knowledge and the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5108",1497,"widest experience? The experience of youth makes the philosopher","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5109",1497,"acquainted with the two kinds of desire, but the avaricious and the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5110",1497,"ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and wisdom. Honour he","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5111",1497,"has equally with them; they are 'judged of him,' but he is 'not judged","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5112",1497,"of them,' for they never attain to the knowledge of true being. And his","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5123",1497,"are true and pure; all others are a shadow only. Let us examine this:","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5124",1497,"Is not pleasure opposed to pain, and is there not a mean state which","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5125",1497,"is neither? When a man is sick, nothing is more pleasant to him than","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5126",1497,"health. But this he never found out while he was well. In pain he","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5127",1497,"desires only to cease from pain; on the other hand, when he is in an","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5128",1497,"ecstasy of pleasure, rest is painful to him. Thus rest or cessation","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5129",1497,"is both pleasure and pain. But can that which is neither become both?","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5130",1497,"Again, pleasure and pain are motions, and the absence of them is rest;","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5131",1497,"but if so, how can the absence of either of them be the other? Thus","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5132",1497,"we are led to infer that the contradiction is an appearance only, and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5133",1497,"witchery of the senses. And these are not the only pleasures, for there","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5134",1497,"are others which have no preceding pains. Pure pleasure then is not the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5135",1497,"absence of pain, nor pure pain the absence of pleasure; although most of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5136",1497,"the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5137",1497,"pain, and have not only their reactions when they depart, but their","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5138",1497,"anticipations before they come. They can be best described in a simile.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5139",1497,"There is in nature an upper, lower, and middle region, and he who passes","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5140",1497,"from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is already","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5141",1497,"in the upper world; and if he were taken back again would think,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5142",1497,"and truly think, that he was descending. All this arises out of his","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5143",1497,"ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions. And a like","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5145",1497,"The man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the man who","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5146",1497,"compares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain pleasure.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5147",1497,"Again, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance and folly","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5148",1497,"of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge of the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5149",1497,"other. Now which is the purer satisfaction--that of eating and drinking,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5150",1497,"or that of knowledge? Consider the matter thus: The satisfaction of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5152",1497,"invariable and immortal has a more real existence than the variable","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5154",1497,"soul, again, has more existence and truth and knowledge than the body,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5371",1497,"made by the carpenter; and the third, by the painter. God only made one,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5405",1497,"received laws from you, as Sicily and Italy have from Charondas, Sparta","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5406",1497,"from Lycurgus, Athens from Solon? Or was any war ever carried on by your","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5407",1497,"counsels? or is any invention attributed to you, as there is to Thales","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5412",1497,"his lifetime was allowed by him and his other friends to starve.' Yes,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5413",1497,"but could this ever have happened if Homer had really been the educator","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5414",1497,"of Hellas? Would he not have had many devoted followers? If Protagoras","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5417",1497,"have been allowed to go about as beggars--I mean if they had really been","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5418",1497,"able to do the world any good?--would not men have compelled them","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5419",1497,"to stay where they were, or have followed them about in order to get","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5420",1497,"education? But they did not; and therefore we may infer that Homer and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5421",1497,"all the poets are only imitators, who do but imitate the appearances of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5422",1497,"things. For as a painter by a knowledge of figure and colour can paint a","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5423",1497,"cobbler without any practice in cobbling, so the poet can delineate","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5424",1497,"any art in the colours of language, and give harmony and rhythm to the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5425",1497,"cobbler and also to the general; and you know how mere narration, when","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5426",1497,"deprived of the ornaments of metre, is like a face which has lost the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5427",1497,"beauty of youth and never had any other. Once more, the imitator has no","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5428",1497,"knowledge of reality, but only of appearance. The painter paints, and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5429",1497,"the artificer makes a bridle and reins, but neither understands the use","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5430",1497,"of them--the knowledge of this is confined to the horseman; and so of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5431",1497,"other things. Thus we have three arts: one of use, another of invention,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5432",1497,"a third of imitation; and the user furnishes the rule to the two others.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5433",1497,"The flute-player will know the good and bad flute, and the maker","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5436",1497,"Imitation, then, is devoid of knowledge, being only a kind of play","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5443",1497,"distance; and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5444",1497,"impose upon us. And the art of measuring and weighing and calculating","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5445",1497,"comes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance; for,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5446",1497,"as we were saying, two contrary opinions of the same about the same and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5447",1497,"at the same time, cannot both of them be true. But which of them is","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5448",1497,"true is determined by the art of calculation; and this is allied to the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5449",1497,"better faculty in the soul, as the arts of imitation are to the worse.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5450",1497,"And the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye, of poetry as well","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5451",1497,"as painting. The imitation is of actions voluntary or involuntary,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5452",1497,"in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result, and present","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5453",1497,"experience of pleasure and pain. But is a man in harmony with himself","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5454",1497,"when he is the subject of these conflicting influences? Is there not","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5455",1497,"rather a contradiction in him? Let me further ask, whether he is more","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5456",1497,"likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when he is in company.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5457",1497,"'In the latter case.' Feeling would lead him to indulge his sorrow, but","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5458",1497,"reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he cannot know","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5459",1497,"whether his affliction is good or evil, and no human thing is of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5460",1497,"any great consequence, while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to good","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5461",1497,"counsel. For when we stumble, we should not, like children, make an","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5462",1497,"uproar; we should take the measures which reason prescribes, not raising","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5463",1497,"a lament, but finding a cure. And the better part of us is ready to","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5464",1497,"follow reason, while the irrational principle is full of sorrow and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5465",1497,"distraction at the recollection of our troubles. Unfortunately, however,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5466",1497,"this latter furnishes the chief materials of the imitative arts. Whereas","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5467",1497,"reason is ever in repose and cannot easily be displayed, especially to a","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5468",1497,"mixed multitude who have no experience of her. Thus the poet is like the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5469",1497,"painter in two ways: first he paints an inferior degree of truth, and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5470",1497,"secondly, he is concerned with an inferior part of the soul. He indulges","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5471",1497,"the feelings, while he enfeebles the reason; and we refuse to allow him","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5472",1497,"to have authority over the mind of man; for he has no measure of greater","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5473",1497,"and less, and is a maker of images and very far gone from truth.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5475",1497,"But we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment--the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5481",1497,"seeing another do what he hates and abominates in himself? Is he not","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5482",1497,"giving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would control?--he is","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5483",1497,"off his guard because the sorrow is another's; and he thinks that he","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5484",1497,"may indulge his feelings without disgrace, and will be the gainer by","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5485",1497,"the pleasure. But the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5486",1497,"weeping at the sorrows of others, will end by weeping at his own. The","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5487",1497,"same is true of comedy,--you may often laugh at buffoonery which you","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5488",1497,"would be ashamed to utter, and the love of coarse merriment on the stage","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5489",1497,"will at last turn you into a buffoon at home. Poetry feeds and waters","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5491",1497,"therefore, when we hear the encomiasts of Homer affirming that he is","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5501",1497,"her that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy, of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5658",1497,"an interpreter who arranged them, and taking from her knees lots, and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"5659",1497,"samples of lives, got up into a pulpit and said: 'Mortal souls, hear","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5665",1497,"samples of lives, many more than the souls present; and there were all","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"5688",1497,"previous life had been a citizen of a well-ordered State, but he had","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"7410",1497,"experience, the effect of spending three years between the ages of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"7414",1497,"one for the cultivation of the mind and the other of the body, but that","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"7415",1497,"they are both equally designed for the improvement of the mind. The","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"7416",1497,"body, in his view, is the servant of the mind; the subjection of the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"8563",1497,"at my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"8567",1497,"resort and keep company with these young men; we are old friends, and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"8572",1497,"have gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"8576",1497,"life harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8577",1497,"","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8578",1497,"I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of my","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8579",1497,"age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says;","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8580",1497,"and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is--I cannot","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8581",1497,"eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away:","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8582",1497,"there was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"8584",1497,"and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8585",1497,"cause. But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8586",1497,"is not really in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8587",1497,"and every other old man, would have felt as they do. But this is not","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8588",1497,"my own experience, nor that of others whom I have known. How well I","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8589",1497,"remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8590",1497,"does love suit with age, Sophocles,--are you still the man you were?","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8591",1497,"Peace, he replied; most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8592",1497,"speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master. His","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8593",1497,"words have often occurred to my mind since, and they seem as good to","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8594",1497,"me now as at the time when he uttered them. For certainly old age has","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8595",1497,"a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax their hold,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8596",1497,"then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of one mad","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8597",1497,"master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8598",1497,"and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed to the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8599",1497,"same cause, which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers; for","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8600",1497,"he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8601",1497,"age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"8606",1497,"are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8607",1497,"age sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8608",1497,"because you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"8611",1497,"something in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"8614",1497,"was an Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"8615",1497,"neither of us would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"9650",1497,"laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"9651",1497,"punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"9652",1497,"to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"9653",1497,"dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"9654",1497,"refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"9655",1497,"And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"9656",1497,"not because they would, but because they cannot help--not under the idea","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"9657",1497,"that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"9658",1497,"a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"9660",1497,"is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"10324",1497,"just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"10325",1497,"individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24034",1497,"already in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24036",1497,"was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what he","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24037",1497,"had seen in the other world. He said that when his soul left the body","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24038",1497,"he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came to a","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24039",1497,"mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth; they","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24040",1497,"were near together, and over against them were two other openings in the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24041",1497,"heaven above. In the intermediate space there were judges seated, who","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24042",1497,"commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them and had bound","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24043",1497,"their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly way on the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24044",1497,"right hand; and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24045",1497,"by the lower way on the left hand; these also bore the symbols of their","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24046",1497,"deeds, but fastened on their backs. He drew near, and they told him that","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24047",1497,"he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24048",1497,"to men, and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24049",1497,"in that place. Then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24050",1497,"either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them;","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24051",1497,"and at the two other openings other souls, some ascending out of the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24052",1497,"earth dusty and worn with travel, some descending out of heaven clean","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24053",1497,"and bright. And arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24054",1497,"long journey, and they went forth with gladness into the meadow, where","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24055",1497,"they encamped as at a festival; and those who knew one another embraced","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24056",1497,"and conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24057",1497,"the things above, and the souls which came from heaven about the things","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24058",1497,"beneath. And they told one another of what had happened by the way,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24063",1497,"story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this:--He","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24064",1497,"said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24065",1497,"tenfold; or once in a hundred years--such being reckoned to be the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24069",1497,"guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24070",1497,"they received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24072",1497,"repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24073",1497,"as they were born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24074",1497,"murderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24075",1497,"described. He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24076",1497,"asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' (Now this Ardiaeus lived","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24080",1497,"The answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not hither and will never","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24084",1497,"Ardiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24095",1497,"away to be cast into hell.' And of all the many terrors which they had","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24096",1497,"endured, he said that there was none like the terror which each of them","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24097",1497,"felt at that moment, lest they should hear the voice; and when there was","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24098",1497,"silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding joy. These, said Er,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24103",1497,"fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24104",1497,"see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24105",1497,"through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24113",1497,"also partly of other materials. Now the whorl is in form like the whorl","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24114",1497,"used on earth; and the description of it implied that there is one large","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24115",1497,"hollow whorl which is quite scooped out, and into this is fitted another","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24116",1497,"lesser one, and another, and another, and four others, making eight","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24119",1497,"continuous whorl. This is pierced by the spindle, which is driven home","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24120",1497,"through the centre of the eighth. The first and outermost whorl has the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24152",1497,"order; then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24153",1497,"lives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24154",1497,"word of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24155",1497,"cycle of life and mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24156",1497,"but you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24157",1497,"have the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24158",1497,"destiny. Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24159",1497,"have more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser--God","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24160",1497,"is justified.' When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24161",1497,"indifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24162",1497,"fell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed), and each as","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24163",1497,"he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. Then the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24164",1497,"Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24165",1497,"there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of all","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24167",1497,"And there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life,","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24168",1497,"others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24169",1497,"exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some who were","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24170",1497,"famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24171",1497,"success in games, or, again, for their birth and the qualities of their","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24172",1497,"ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24173",1497,"qualities. And of women likewise; there was not, however, any definite","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24174",1497,"character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life, must of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24176",1497,"the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24177",1497,"poverty, and disease and health; and there were mean states also. And","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24178",1497,"here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state; and","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24190",1497,"the operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the nature of","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24192",1497,"able to determine which is the better and which is the worse; and so","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24193",1497,"he will choose, giving the name of evil to the life which will make his","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"24215",1497,"he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the","The Republic","Plato","Philosophy","en"
