"35",1605,"three questions which nobody had ever been able to answer, and they were","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"68",1605,"pleasant news for their husbands, who disliked the women's cooking","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"78",1605,"thick, so that it was the most solitary and quiet place in the world,","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"83",1605,"much indeed, but they spoke of the second with stern disapproval, and,","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"84",1605,"even when it was made by a bird, a breeze, or a shower of rain, they","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"85",1605,"grew angry and demanded that it should be abolished. Their wives seldom","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"91",1605,"like thunder, and gentler sounds like the tapping of grey ashes on a","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"108",1605,"childish games, flitting among the shadowy trees like little quick","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"112",1605,"were very round and very glassy, and had immense circles of horn all","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"115",1605,"brushwood; they were full of fun and were very fond of playing with the","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"125",1605,"sun for a few hours in the summer time blazed down. It was the boy who","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"131",1605,"had never seen anything like it before, and the steady, unwinking glare","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"132",1605,"aroused his fear and curiosity equally. Curiosity will conquer fear","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"137",1605,"emboldened by curiosity, he stepped right into it and found that it was","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"138",1605,"not a thing at all. The instant that he stepped into the light he found","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"139",1605,"it was hot, and this so frightened him that he jumped out of it again","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"140",1605,"and ran behind a tree. Then he jumped into it for a moment and out of it","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"141",1605,"again, and for nearly half an hour he played a splendid game of tip and","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"143",1605,"found that it did not burn him at all, but he did not like to remain","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"871",1605,"walking over to the tree in the southeast corner, she picked up a small","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"943",1605,"of one child only, and she was the most beautiful girl in the whole","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"944",1605,"world. The pity of it was that no one at all knew she was beautiful, and","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"945",1605,"she did not even know it herself. At times when she bathed in the eddy","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"946",1605,"of a mountain stream and saw her reflection looking up from the placid","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"947",1605,"water she thought that she looked very nice, and then a great sadness","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"948",1605,"would come upon her, for what is the use of looking nice if there is","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"949",1605,"nobody to see one's beauty? Beauty, also, is usefulness. The arts as","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"950",1605,"well as the crafts, the graces equally with the utilities must stand up","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"951",1605,"in the marketplace and be judged by the gombeen men.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"953",1605,"The only house near to her father's was that occupied by Bessie","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"

"956",1605,"than a couple of men beside her father since she was born. She helped","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"957",1605,"her father and mother in all the small businesses of their house, and","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"958",1605,"every day also she drove their three cows and two goats to pasture on","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"959",1605,"the mountain slopes. Here through the sunny days the years had passed","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"960",1605,"in a slow, warm thoughtlessness wherein, without thinking, many thoughts","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"961",1605,"had entered into her mind and many pictures hung for a moment like","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"962",1605,"birds in the thin air. At first, and for a long time, she had been happy","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"963",1605,"enough; there were many things in which a child might be interested:","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"964",1605,"the spacious heavens which never wore the same beauty on any day; the","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"965",1605,"innumerable little creatures living among the grasses or in the heather;","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"966",1605,"the steep swing of a bird down from the mountain to the infinite plains","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"967",1605,"below; the little flowers which were so contented each in its peaceful","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"968",1605,"place; the bees gathering food for their houses, and the stout beetles","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"969",1605,"who are always losing their way in the dusk. These things, and many","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"970",1605,"others, interested her. The three cows after they had grazed for a long","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"971",1605,"time would come and lie by her side and look at her as they chewed their","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"972",1605,"cud, and the goats would prance from the bracken to push their heads","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"973",1605,"against her breast because they loved her.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"974",1605,"","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"975",1605,"Indeed, everything in her quiet world loved this girl: but very slowly","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"976",1605,"there was growing in her consciousness an unrest, a disquietude to","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"977",1605,"which she had hitherto been a stranger. Sometimes an infinite weariness","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"978",1605,"oppressed her to the earth. A thought was born in her mind and it had","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"979",1605,"no name. It was growing and could not be expressed. She had no words","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"980",1605,"wherewith to meet it, to exorcise or greet this stranger who, more and","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"981",1605,"more insistently and pleadingly, tapped upon her doors and begged to","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"982",1605,"be spoken to, admitted and caressed and nourished. A thought is a real","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"983",1605,"thing and words are only its raiment, but a thought is as shy as a","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"984",1605,"virgin; unless it is fittingly apparelled we may not look on its shadowy","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"985",1605,"nakedness: it will fly from us and only return again in the darkness","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"986",1605,"crying in a thin, childish voice which we may not comprehend until, with","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"987",1605,"aching minds, listening and divining, we at last fashion for it those","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"988",1605,"symbols which are its protection and its banner. So she could not","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"989",1605,"understand the touch that came to her from afar and yet how intimately,","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"990",1605,"the whisper so aloof and yet so thrillingly personal. The standard of","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"991",1605,"either language or experience was not hers; she could listen but not","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"992",1605,"think, she could feel but not know, her eyes looked forward and did not","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"993",1605,"see, her hands groped in the sunlight and felt nothing. It was like the","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"994",1605,"edge of a little wind which stirred her tresses but could not lift them,","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"995",1605,"or the first white peep of the dawn which is neither light nor darkness.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"996",1605,"But she listened, not with her ears but with her blood. The fingers of","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"997",1605,"her soul stretched out to clasp a stranger's hand, and her disquietude","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"998",1605,"was quickened through with an eagerness which was neither physical nor","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"999",1605,"mental, for neither her body nor her mind was definitely interested.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1000",1605,"Some dim region between these grew alarmed and watched and waited and","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1001",1605,"did not sleep or grow weary at all.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1002",1605,"","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1003",1605,"One morning she lay among the long, warm grasses. She watched a bird who","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1004",1605,"soared and sang for a little time, and then it sped swiftly away down","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1005",1605,"the steep air and out of sight in the blue distance. Even when it was","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1006",1605,"gone the song seemed to ring in her ears. It seemed to linger with her","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1007",1605,"as a faint, sweet echo, coming fitfully, with little pauses as though a","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1008",1605,"wind disturbed it, and careless, distant eddies. After a few moments she","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1009",1605,"knew it was not a bird. No bird's song had that consecutive melody, for","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1010",1605,"their themes are as careless as their wings. She sat up and looked about","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1011",1605,"her, but there was nothing in sight: the mountains sloped gently above","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1012",1605,"her and away to the clear sky; around her the scattered clumps of","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1013",1605,"heather were drowsing in the sunlight; far below she could see her","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1014",1605,"father's house, a little grey patch near some trees-and then the music","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1015",1605,"stopped and left her wondering.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1016",1605,"","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1017",1605,"She could not find her goats anywhere although for a long time she","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1018",1605,"searched. They came to her at last of their own accord from behind a","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1019",1605,"fold in the hills, and they were more wildly excited than she had ever","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1020",1605,"seen them before. Even the cows forsook their solemnity and broke into","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1021",1605,"awkward gambols around her. As she walked home that evening a strange","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1022",1605,"elation taught her feet to dance. Hither and thither she flitted in","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1023",1605,"front of the beasts and behind them. Her feet tripped to a wayward","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1024",1605,"measure. There was a tune in her ears and she danced to it, throwing","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1025",1605,"her arms out and above her head and swaying and bending as she went.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1026",1605,"The full freedom of her body was hers now: the lightness and poise and","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1027",1605,"certainty of her limbs delighted her, and the strength that did not","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1028",1605,"tire delighted her also. The evening was full of peace and quietude, the","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1029",1605,"mellow, dusky sunlight made a path for her feet, and everywhere through","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1030",1605,"the wide fields birds were flashing and singing, and she sang with them","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1031",1605,"a song that had no words and wanted none.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1032",1605,"","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1033",1605,"The following day she heard the music again, faint and thin, wonderfully","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1034",1605,"sweet and as wild as the song of a bird, but it was a melody which","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1035",1605,"no bird would adhere to. A theme was repeated again and again. In the","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1036",1605,"middle of trills, grace-notes, runs and catches it recurred with a","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1037",1605,"strange, almost holy, solemnity,--a hushing, slender melody full of","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1038",1605,"austerity and aloofness. There was something in it to set her heart","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1039",1605,"beating. She yearned to it with her ears and her lips. Was it joy,","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1040",1605,"menace, carelessness? She did not know, but this she did know, that","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1041",1605,"however terrible it was personal to her. It was her unborn thought","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1042",1605,"strangely audible and felt rather than understood.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1043",1605,"","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1044",1605,"On that day she did not see anybody either. She drove her charges home","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1045",1605,"in the evening listlessly and the beasts also were very quiet.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1046",1605,"","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1047",1605,"When the music came again she made no effort to discover where it came","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1048",1605,"from. She only listened, and when the tune was ended she saw a figure","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1049",1605,"rise from the fold of a little hill. The sunlight was gleaming from his","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1050",1605,"arms and shoulders but the rest of his body was hidden by the bracken,","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1051",1605,"and he did not look at her as he went away playing softly on a double","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1052",1605,"pipe.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1053",1605,"","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1054",1605,"The next day he did look at her. He stood waist-deep in greenery","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1055",1605,"fronting her squarely. She had never seen so strange a face before. Her","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1056",1605,"eyes almost died on him as she gazed and he returned her look for a long","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1057",1605,"minute with an intent, expressionless regard. His hair was a cluster of","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1058",1605,"brown curls, his nose was little and straight, and his wide mouth","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1059",1605,"drooped sadly at the corners. His eyes were wide and most mournful, and","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1060",1605,"his forehead was very broad and white. His sad eyes and mouth almost","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1061",1605,"made her weep.","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
"1062",1605,"","The Crock of Gold","Stephens, James","Fantasy","en"
