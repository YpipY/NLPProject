"41",16406,"","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"42",16406,"3.  To give a general view of the main problems with which philosophers","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"

"44",16406,"","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"

"58",16406,"","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"59",16406,"Such is the scope of my book.  It aims to tell what philosophy is.  It","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"60",16406,"is not its chief object to advocate a particular type of doctrine.  At","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"61",16406,"the same time, as it is impossible to treat of the problems of","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"62",16406,"philosophy except from some point of view, it will be found that, in","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"63",16406,"Chapters III to XI, a doctrine is presented.  It is the same as that","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"64",16406,"presented much more in detail, and with a greater wealth of reference,","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"65",16406,"in my ""System of Metaphysics,"" which was published a short time ago.","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"

"67",16406,"references to those parts of the larger work which treat of the","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"68",16406,"subjects more briefly discussed here.  It will be helpful to the","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"69",16406,"teacher to keep the larger work on hand, and to use more or less of the","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"70",16406,"material there presented as his undergraduate classes discuss the","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"71",16406,"chapters of this one.  Other references are also given in the Notes,","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"

"74",16406,"The present book has been made as clear and simple as possible, that no","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"75",16406,"unnecessary difficulties may be placed in the path of those who enter","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"76",16406,"upon the thorny road of philosophical reflection.  The subjects treated","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"77",16406,"are deep enough to demand the serious attention of any one; and they","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"78",16406,"are subjects of fascinating interest.  That they are treated simply and","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"79",16406,"clearly does not mean that they are treated superficially.  Indeed,","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"80",16406,"when a doctrine is presented in outline and in a brief and simple","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"81",16406,"statement, its meaning may be more readily apparent than when it is","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"82",16406,"treated more exhaustively.  For this reason, I especially recommend,","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"83",16406,"even to those who are well acquainted with philosophy, the account of","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"

"86",16406,"For the doctrine I advocate I am inclined to ask especial consideration","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
"87",16406,"on the ground that it is, on the whole, a justification of the attitude","An Introduction to Philosophy","Fullerton, George Stuart","Philosophy","en"
