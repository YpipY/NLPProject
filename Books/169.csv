"787",169,"came up to the churchyard-gate he saw a great black horse tied thereto","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"788",169,"as if abiding some one; and as he lighted down from his saddle he saw a","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"791",169,"sallet on his head, which covered his face all save the end of his","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"792",169,"chin; and plates he had on his legs and arms.  He wore a green coat","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"793",169,"over his armour, and thereon was wrought in gold an image of a tree","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"794",169,"leafless:  he had a little steel axe about his neck, and a great sword","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"797",169,"roughly and shoved through at once, driving Ralph back, so that he","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"799",169,"into the saddle, just as Ralph steadied himself and ruffled up to him,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"816",169,"and went his ways into the church, wherein he found his good lord and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"824",169,"down on the said bent, he saw strange figures on the face thereof, done","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"825",169,"by cutting away the turf so that the chalk might show clear.  A tree","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"826",169,"with leaves was done on that hill-side, and on either hand of it a","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"827",169,"beast like a bear ramping up against the tree; and these signs were","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"838",169,"aback on the blue country which he had ridden through stretching many a","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"840",169,"diverse wealth of the summer land: but Upmeads Water was hidden, and he","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1085",169,"through the windows out-did the candle-light in the hall.  Ralph","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1086",169,"started thereat and laid his right hand to the place of his sword,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1087",169,"which indeed he had left with the chamberlain; but the monk laughed and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1088",169,"said:  ""Fear nothing, lord; there is no foeman in Higham: come now,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1090",169,"","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1091",169,"So he led Ralph forth, and into the square, where there was a space","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1092",169,"appointed for the brethren and their guests to see the plays; and the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1096",169,"There were rows of men-at-arms in bright armour also to keep the folk","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1097",169,"in their places, like as hurdles pen the sheep up; howbeit they were","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1098",169,"nowise rough with folk, but humble and courteous.  Many and many were","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1099",169,"the torches and cressets burning steadily in the calm air, so that, as","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1100",169,"aforesaid, night was turned into day.  But on the scaffold aforesaid","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1101",169,"were standing bright and gay figures, whose names or what they were","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1102",169,"Ralph had no time to ask.","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1103",169,"","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1104",169,"Now the bells began to clash from the great tower of the minster, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1105",169,"in a little while they had clashed themselves into order and rang clear","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1106",169,"and tuneably for a space; and while they were ringing, lo! those","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1107",169,"gay-clad people departed from the scaffold, and a canvas painted like a","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1108",169,"mountain-side, rocky and with caves therein, was drawn up at the back","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1109",169,"of it.  Then came thereon one clad like a king holding a fair maiden by","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1110",169,"the hand, and with him was a dame richly clad and with a crown on her","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1111",169,"head.  So these two kissed the maiden, and lamented over her, and went","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1112",169,"their ways, and the maiden left alone sat down upon a rock and covered","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1113",169,"up her face and wept; and while Ralph wondered what this might mean, or","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1114",169,"what grieved the maiden, there came creeping, as it were from out of a","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1115",169,"cranny of the rocks, a worm huge-headed and covered over with scales","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1116",169,"that glittered in the torch-light. Then Ralph sprang up in his place,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1117",169,"for he feared for the maiden that the worm would devour her:  but the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1118",169,"monk who sat by him pulled him down by the skirt, and laughed and said:","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1122",169,"heart in his mouth the while.  And so while the maiden stood as one","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1123",169,"astonied before the worm, who gaped upon her with wide open mouth,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1124",169,"there came forth from a cleft in the rocks a goodly knight who bore","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1125",169,"silver, a red cross; and he had his sword in his hand, and he fell upon","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1126",169,"the worm to smite him; and the worm ramped up against him, and there","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1127",169,"was battle betwixt them, while the maiden knelt anigh with her hands","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1128",169,"clasped together.","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1129",169,"","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1130",169,"Then Ralph knew that this was a play of the fight of St. George with","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1131",169,"the worm; so he sat silent till the champion had smitten off the worm's","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1132",169,"head and had come to the maiden and kissed and embraced her, and shown","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1133",169,"her the grisly head.  Then presently came many folk on to the scaffold,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1134",169,"to wit, the king and queen who were the father and mother of the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1135",169,"maiden, and a bishop clad in very fair vestments, and knights withal;","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1136",169,"and they stood about St. George and the maiden, and with them were","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1137",169,"minstrels who fell to playing upon harps and fiddles; while other some","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1138",169,"fell to singing a sweet song in honour of St. George, and the maiden","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1139",169,"delivered.","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1140",169,"","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1141",169,"So when it was all done, the monk said:  ""This play is set forth by the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1151",169,"me, that there is much of what is presently to come which we shall see","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1152",169,"better from the minster roof, or even it may be from the tower:  wilt","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1159",169,"west front of the minster, where on the north side was a little door in","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1160",169,"a nook.  So they went up a stair therein a good way till they came into","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1161",169,"a gallery over the western door; and looking forth thence Ralph deemed","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1162",169,"that he could have seen a long way had daylight been, for it was higher","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1164",169,"","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1165",169,"So there they abode a space looking down on the square and its throng,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1166",169,"and the bells, which had been ringing when they came up, now ceased a","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1167",169,"while.  But presently there arose great shouts and clamour amongst the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1168",169,"folk below, and they could see men with torches drawing near to the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1169",169,"pile of wood, and then all of a sudden shot up from it a great spiring","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1170",169,"flame, and all the people shouted together, while the bells broke out","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1711",169,"through a rough waste, no pasture, save for mountain sheep or goats,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1712",169,"with a few bushes scattered about it; and beyond this the land rose","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1715",169,"dry and parched, and the afternoon sun was hot on it; so he deemed it","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1716",169,"good to come under the shadow of the thick trees (which at the first","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1765",169,"two men who had taken him, and under it, on a white horse, sat a Knight","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1773",169,"their hands were bound behind their backs and their feet tied together","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1774",169,"under their horses' bellies.  The company of those about the Knight,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3640",169,"to the stable, while those twain entered the hall, which was as goodly","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3968",169,"goodliest and the richest of all.  Its roof was all done with gold and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3969",169,"blue from over sea, and its pavement wrought delicately in Alexandrine","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4234",169,"the dame good day, and departed light-foot but heavy hearted.  Yet as","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4235",169,"he went, he kept saying to himself:  ""Did she not send that Roger to","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4241",169,"paths and open places, going south and east of the House: whereas the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4242",169,"last day he had gone west and north.  He went a soft pace, but wandered","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4243",169,"on without any stay till it was noon, and he had seen nought but the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4244",169,"wild things of the wood, nor many of them.  But at last he heard the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4245",169,"tinkle of a little bell coming towards him: so he stood still and got","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4246",169,"the hilt of his sword ready to his hand; and the tinkle drew nearer,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4247",169,"and he heard withal the trample of some riding-beast; so he went toward","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4248",169,"the sound, and presently in a clearer place of the wood came upon a man","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4249",169,"of religion, a clerk, riding on a hackney, to whose neck hung a","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4252",169,"Ralph gave him the sele of the day, and asked him whither he would.","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4253",169,"Said the Priest:  ""I am for the Little Plain and the Land of Abundance;","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4313",169,"arrayed fairer than any queen in a golden gown.  Yea, as fair as the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4319",169,"bridle-rein dreamy no less; for the words that he had heard he heeded","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4324",169,"about like one come out of slumber, and said in a firm voice: ""I tell","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4326",169,"therewith suddenly he fell a-weeping; and Ralph was ill at ease of his","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4327",169,"weeping, and went along by him saying nought; till the priest plucked","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4328",169,"up heart again, and said, turning to Ralph, but not meeting his eye:","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4331",169,"tears brake out again, and Ralph strode on fast, so as to outgo him,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4332",169,"thinking it unmannerly to seem as if he noted not his sorrow; yet","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4336",169,"Within a while the priest caught up with him, his tears all staunched,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4338",169,"Little Land and the dwellers therein and the conditions of them, and he","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4520",169,"fashion of the thickets and the woods changed about him; and at last","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4521",169,"when the sun was getting low, he saw light gleaming through a great","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4522",169,"wood of pines, which had long been dark before him against the tall","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4523",169,"boles, and soon he came to the very edge of the wood, and going","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4524",169,"heedfully, saw between the great stems of the outermost trees, a green","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4525",169,"strand, and beyond it a long smooth water, a little lake between green","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4526",169,"banks on either side.  He came out of the pinewood on to the grass; but","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4527",169,"there were thornbushes a few about, so that moving warily from one to","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4528",169,"the other, he might perchance see without being seen.  Warily he went","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4529",169,"forsooth, going along the green strand to the east and the head of that","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4530",169,"water, and saw how the bank sloped up gently from its ending toward the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4531",169,"pine-wood, in front of whose close-set trees stood three great-boled","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4532",169,"tall oak-trees on a smooth piece of green sward.  And now he saw that","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4533",169,"there were folk come before him on this green place, and keen-sighted","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4534",169,"as he was, could make out that three men were on the hither side of the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4536",169,"Thitherward then he made, stealing from bush to bush, since he deemed","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4537",169,"that he needed not be seen of men who might be foes, for at the first","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4540",169,"sword, and then another sprang up to meet it, and he heard faintly the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4541",169,"clash of steel, and saw withal that the third of the folk had long and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4542",169,"light raiment and was a woman belike.  Then he bettered his pace, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4543",169,"in a minute or two came so near that he could see the men clearly, that","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4545",169,"so that the still place rang with the clatter.  As for the woman, he","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4546",169,"could see but little of her, because of the fighting men before her;","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4549",169,"Now as he went, hidden by the bushes, they hid the men also from him,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4550",169,"and when he was come to the last bush, some fifty paces from them, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4551",169,"peered out from it, in that very nick of time the two knights were","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4552",169,"breathing them somewhat, and Ralph saw that one of them, the furthest","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4553",169,"from him, was a very big man with a blue surcoat whereon was beaten a","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4554",169,"great golden sun, and the other, whose back was towards Ralph, was clad","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4555",169,"in black over his armour.  Even as he looked and doubted whether to","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4556",169,"show himself or not, he of the sun raised his sword aloft, and giving","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4557",169,"forth a great roar as of wrath and grief mingled together, rushed on","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4558",169,"his foe and smote so fiercely that he fell to the earth before him, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4559",169,"the big man fell upon him as he fell, and let knee and sword-pommel and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4567",169,"delivered at the want-ways. His heart well nigh stood still with joy,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4571",169,"short, and thereover a cote-hardy of black cloth with orphreys of gold","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4572",169,"and colours:  but on her neck was a collar that seemed to him like to","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7322",169,"saw her gown fluttering nigh one of the thorn-bushes.  Then he did off","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7323",169,"his raiment and entered that pool of the stream, and was glad to bathe","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7325",169,"noted that the stones of the little shore were still wet with her feet","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7332",169,"up, laughing still and gasping, he heard a noise of the clatter of","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7339",169,"his head; but while his arms were yet entangled in the sleeves thereof,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7386",169,"of the day gone by; for the summer night was come now, most fair and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7387",169,"fragrant.  But he withheld the sobbing passion of his heart and put","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7393",169,"edge of the green table, and there came into his mind despite himself","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7394",169,"thoughts of the pleasant fields of Upmeads, and his sports and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7398",169,"make an end of it.  But so weary was he, that at last he lay back and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7399",169,"fell asleep, and woke not till the sun was high in the heavens.  And so","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7400",169,"it was, that his slumber had been so heavy, that he knew not at first","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7401",169,"what had befallen; and one moment he felt glad, and the next as if he","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7402",169,"should never be glad again, though why he wotted not.  Then he turned","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7403",169,"about and saw Silverfax cropping the grass nearby, and the Lady lying","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7412",169,"came upon the quenched coals of the cooking-fire: she had baked cakes","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7416",169,"and therefore was life more grievous to him, and when he thought what","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7422",169,"and face he came back again, and hardened his heart to do what he must","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7424",169,"be told of, he drew it into the cave, and cut boughs of trees and laid","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7427",169,"her till she was utterly hidden by them.  Then he came out on to the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7428",169,"green place and looked on the body of his foe, and said to himself that","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9138",169,"beside a stone like a leaping-on stone saw a tall man, goodly of","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9141",169,"brought their wares to the cheaping.  And some of these were arrayed","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9142",169,"like those foemen of the mountains.  There was a half score and three","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9164",169,"into his house, where they might speak more privily.  So did they, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9165",169,"he treated them with honour, and set wine and spices before them, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9166",169,"bade Ralph say whatlike the woman was.  Ralph did so, and wondered at","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9167",169,"himself how well and closely he could tell of her, like as a picture","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9168",169,"painted.  And, moreover, he drew forth that piece of her gown which he","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9169",169,"had come on by the Mid-Mountain House.","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9170",169,"","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9171",169,"So when he had done, the merchant, who was a man sober of aspect and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9172",169,"somewhat slow of speech, said:  ""Sir, I believe surely that I have seen","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9173",169,"this damsel, but she is not with me now, nor have I sold her ever; but","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9174",169,"hither was she brought to be sold by a man of the mountain folk not","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9175",169,"very many days ago.  And the man's name was Bull Nosy, or the longnosed","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9176",169,"man of the kindred of the Bull, for in such wise are named the men of","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9177",169,"that unhappy folk.  Now this was the cause why I might not sell her,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9178",169,"that she was so proud and stout that men feared her, what she might do","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9179",169,"if they had her away.  And when some spake to see her body naked, she","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9180",169,"denied it utterly, saying that she would do a mischief to whomsoever","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9181",169,"tried it.  So I spake to him who owned her, and asked him if he thought","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9183",169,"spoil her but little, and then bring her to market when she was meeker.","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9184",169,"But he heeded my words little, and led her away, she riding on a horse","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9186",169,"","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9188",169,"the merchant:  ""By my deeming, he will have gone first of all to the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9189",169,"town of Whiteness, whither thy Fellowship will betake them ere long:","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9191",169,"such like wares; and he will either give her to him as a gift, for","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9192",169,"which he will have a gift in return, or he will sell her to my lord at","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9194",169,"be wise.  Now if the said lord hath her, it will be somewhat more than","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9195",169,"hard for thee to get her again, till he have altogether done with her;","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9196",169,"for money and goods are naught to him beside the doing of his will.","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9197",169,"But there is this for thy comfort, that whereas she is so fair a woman,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9198",169,"she will be well with my lord.  For I warrant me that she will not dare","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9200",169,"","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9201",169,"""Yea,"" said Ralph, ""and what is this lord of Utterbol that all folk,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9202",169,"men and women, fear him so?""  Said the merchant: ""Fair sir, thou must","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9276",169,"so steep was the hill whereon the town stood, that it needed not.  Here","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9294",169,"her, without bringing her to the stone, and that it was most like that","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9296",169,"deeming that he might easily bend her to his will, would give him the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9480",169,"wilderness began to better, and there was grass at whiles, and bushes","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9482",169,"through the rocks by a swift stream which had once been far greater","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9484",169,"looking down from the top of it, beheld the open country again.  But","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9485",169,"this was otherwise from what they had beheld from the mountain's brow","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9487",169,"those that they had just ridden, were clear to be seen like the wall of","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9489",169,"but a great spreading plain with no hills rising from it, save that far","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9491",169,"that was brighter than the face of the land elsewhere.  Clement told","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9492",169,"Ralph that this was Goldburg and that it was built on a gathering of","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9494",169,"said he, was not so wholly flat and even as it looked from up there,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9495",169,"but swelled at whiles into downs and low hills.  He told him that","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9496",169,"Goldburg was an exceeding fair town to behold; that the lord who had","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9498",169,"and artificers of all kinds, that they might make it as fair as might","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9500",169,"sooth he deemed that he should find the Well at the World's End, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9501",169,"drink thereof, and live long and young and fair past all record;","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10090",169,"so that thou mightest believe my word, which is true.  Thus it goes: As","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10091",169,"I left Utterbol a month ago, I saw a damsel brought in captive there,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10092",169,"and she seemed to me so exceeding fair that I looked hard on her, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10093",169,"asked one of the men-at-arms who is my friend concerning the market","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10094",169,"whereat she was cheapened; and he told me that she had not been bought,","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10095",169,"but taken out of the hands of the wild men from the further mountains.","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10096",169,"Is that aught like to your story, lord?""  ""Yea,"" said Ralph, knitting","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10097",169,"his brows in eagerness.  ""Well,"" said Morfinn, ""but there are more fair","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10099",169,"as well as I may, I will tell thee what-like she was, and if thou","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10100",169,"knowest her not, thou mayst give me those two gold pieces and go back","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10109",169,"through it; her hair brown, yet with a fair bright colour shining","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10110",169,"therein, and very abundant: her cheeks smooth, round and well wrought","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10111",169,"as any imager could do them: her chin round and cloven:  her lips full","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12240",169,"rough carle as he was, and Redhead kneeled to him one moment of time","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12241",169,"and then arose and went off into the night.  But Ralph got a-horseback","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12242",169,"without delay and rode his ways warily across the highway and into the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12243",169,"wood, and there was none to hinder him.  Though it was dark but for the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12244",169,"starlight, there was a path, which the horse, and not Ralph, found, so","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12245",169,"that he made some way even before the first glimmer of dawn, all the","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12246",169,"more as the wood was not very thick after the first mile, and there","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12251",169,"whereof there was more thicket, as he deemed, then he had yet come to;","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12252",169,"so he drew rein and looked about him for a minute.  Even therewith he","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12256",169,"that he hears the voice of a woman:  and therewith came into his mind","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"14525",169,"strife that had beset his days.  But after a little he looked up, and","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"14526",169,"dashed the tears from his eyes and smiled on Ursula and said:  ""The","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"14545",169,"elder who had brought them from Chestnut-dale said: ""Dear friends, I","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"15108",169,"that the sea, which last night had washed the face of the cliff, had","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"15109",169,"now ebbed far out, and left bare betwixt the billows and the cliff some","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"15112",169,"against the cliff, was builded by man's hand of huge stones a garth of","The Well at the World's End: A Tale","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
