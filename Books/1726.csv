"13",1726,"Some dialogues of Plato are of so various a character that their","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"14",1726,"relation to the other dialogues cannot be determined with any degree of","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"15",1726,"certainty. The Theaetetus, like the Parmenides, has points of similarity","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"16",1726,"both with his earlier and his later writings. The perfection of style,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"17",1726,"the humour, the dramatic interest, the complexity of structure, the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"18",1726,"fertility of illustration, the shifting of the points of view, are","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"19",1726,"characteristic of his best period of authorship. The vain search, the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"20",1726,"negative conclusion, the figure of the midwives, the constant profession","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"21",1726,"of ignorance on the part of Socrates, also bear the stamp of the early","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"22",1726,"dialogues, in which the original Socrates is not yet Platonized. Had we","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"23",1726,"no other indications, we should be disposed to range the Theaetetus with","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"24",1726,"the Apology and the Phaedrus, and perhaps even with the Protagoras and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"25",1726,"the Laches.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"26",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"27",1726,"But when we pass from the style to an examination of the subject,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"28",1726,"we trace a connection with the later rather than with the earlier","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"29",1726,"dialogues. In the first place there is the connexion, indicated by Plato","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"30",1726,"himself at the end of the dialogue, with the Sophist, to which in","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"31",1726,"many respects the Theaetetus is so little akin. (1) The same persons","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"32",1726,"reappear, including the younger Socrates, whose name is just mentioned","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"33",1726,"in the Theaetetus; (2) the theory of rest, which Socrates has declined","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"34",1726,"to consider, is resumed by the Eleatic Stranger; (3) there is a similar","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"35",1726,"allusion in both dialogues to the meeting of Parmenides and Socrates","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"36",1726,"(Theaet., Soph.); and (4) the inquiry into not-being in the Sophist","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"37",1726,"supplements the question of false opinion which is raised in the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"38",1726,"Theaetetus. (Compare also Theaet. and Soph. for parallel turns of","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"39",1726,"thought.) Secondly, the later date of the dialogue is confirmed by the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"40",1726,"absence of the doctrine of recollection and of any doctrine of ideas","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"41",1726,"except that which derives them from generalization and from reflection","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"42",1726,"of the mind upon itself. The general character of the Theaetetus is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"43",1726,"dialectical, and there are traces of the same Megarian influences which","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"44",1726,"appear in the Parmenides, and which later writers, in their matter of","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"45",1726,"fact way, have explained by the residence of Plato at Megara. Socrates","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"46",1726,"disclaims the character of a professional eristic, and also, with a sort","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"47",1726,"of ironical admiration, expresses his inability to attain the Megarian","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"48",1726,"precision in the use of terms. Yet he too employs a similar sophistical","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"49",1726,"skill in overturning every conceivable theory of knowledge.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"50",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"51",1726,"The direct indications of a date amount to no more than this: the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"52",1726,"conversation is said to have taken place when Theaetetus was a youth,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"53",1726,"and shortly before the death of Socrates. At the time of his own death","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"54",1726,"he is supposed to be a full-grown man. Allowing nine or ten years for","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"55",1726,"the interval between youth and manhood, the dialogue could not have been","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"56",1726,"written earlier than 390, when Plato was about thirty-nine years of age.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"57",1726,"No more definite date is indicated by the engagement in which Theaetetus","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"58",1726,"is said to have fallen or to have been wounded, and which may have taken","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"59",1726,"place any time during the Corinthian war, between the years 390-387.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"60",1726,"The later date which has been suggested, 369, when the Athenians and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"61",1726,"Lacedaemonians disputed the Isthmus with Epaminondas, would make the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"62",1726,"age of Theaetetus at his death forty-five or forty-six. This a little","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"63",1726,"impairs the beauty of Socrates' remark, that 'he would be a great man if","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"64",1726,"he lived.'","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"65",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"66",1726,"In this uncertainty about the place of the Theaetetus, it seemed better,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"67",1726,"as in the case of the Republic, Timaeus, Critias, to retain the order in","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"68",1726,"which Plato himself has arranged this and the two companion dialogues.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"69",1726,"We cannot exclude the possibility which has been already noticed in","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"70",1726,"reference to other works of Plato, that the Theaetetus may not have","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"71",1726,"been all written continuously; or the probability that the Sophist and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"72",1726,"Politicus, which differ greatly in style, were only appended after a","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"73",1726,"long interval of time. The allusion to Parmenides compared with the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"74",1726,"Sophist, would probably imply that the dialogue which is called by his","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"75",1726,"name was already in existence; unless, indeed, we suppose the passage in","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"76",1726,"which the allusion occurs to have been inserted afterwards. Again,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"77",1726,"the Theaetetus may be connected with the Gorgias, either dialogue from","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"78",1726,"different points of view containing an analysis of the real and apparent","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"79",1726,"(Schleiermacher); and both may be brought into relation with the Apology","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"80",1726,"as illustrating the personal life of Socrates. The Philebus, too, may","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"81",1726,"with equal reason be placed either after or before what, in the language","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"82",1726,"of Thrasyllus, may be called the Second Platonic Trilogy. Both the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"83",1726,"Parmenides and the Sophist, and still more the Theaetetus, have points","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"84",1726,"of affinity with the Cratylus, in which the principles of rest and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"85",1726,"motion are again contrasted, and the Sophistical or Protagorean theory","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"86",1726,"of language is opposed to that which is attributed to the disciple","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"87",1726,"of Heracleitus, not to speak of lesser resemblances in thought and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"88",1726,"language. The Parmenides, again, has been thought by some to hold an","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"89",1726,"intermediate position between the Theaetetus and the Sophist; upon this","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"90",1726,"view, the Sophist may be regarded as the answer to the problems about","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"91",1726,"One and Being which have been raised in the Parmenides. Any of these","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"92",1726,"arrangements may suggest new views to the student of Plato; none of them","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"93",1726,"can lay claim to an exclusive probability in its favour.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"94",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"95",1726,"The Theaetetus is one of the narrated dialogues of Plato, and is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"96",1726,"the only one which is supposed to have been written down. In a short","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"97",1726,"introductory scene, Euclides and Terpsion are described as meeting","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"98",1726,"before the door of Euclides' house in Megara. This may have been a","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"99",1726,"spot familiar to Plato (for Megara was within a walk of Athens), but no","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"100",1726,"importance can be attached to the accidental introduction of the founder","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"101",1726,"of the Megarian philosophy. The real intention of the preface is to","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"102",1726,"create an interest about the person of Theaetetus, who has just been","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"103",1726,"carried up from the army at Corinth in a dying state. The expectation","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"104",1726,"of his death recalls the promise of his youth, and especially the famous","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"105",1726,"conversation which Socrates had with him when he was quite young, a few","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"106",1726,"days before his own trial and death, as we are once more reminded at the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"107",1726,"end of the dialogue. Yet we may observe that Plato has himself forgotten","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"108",1726,"this, when he represents Euclides as from time to time coming to Athens","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"109",1726,"and correcting the copy from Socrates' own mouth. The narrative, having","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"110",1726,"introduced Theaetetus, and having guaranteed the authenticity of the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"111",1726,"dialogue (compare Symposium, Phaedo, Parmenides), is then dropped. No","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"112",1726,"further use is made of the device. As Plato himself remarks, who in this","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"113",1726,"as in some other minute points is imitated by Cicero (De Amicitia), the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"114",1726,"interlocutory words are omitted.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"115",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"116",1726,"Theaetetus, the hero of the battle of Corinth and of the dialogue, is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"117",1726,"a disciple of Theodorus, the great geometrician, whose science is thus","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"118",1726,"indicated to be the propaedeutic to philosophy. An interest has been","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"119",1726,"already excited about him by his approaching death, and now he is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"120",1726,"introduced to us anew by the praises of his master Theodorus. He is a","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"121",1726,"youthful Socrates, and exhibits the same contrast of the fair soul and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"122",1726,"the ungainly face and frame, the Silenus mask and the god within, which","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"123",1726,"are described in the Symposium. The picture which Theodorus gives of","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"124",1726,"his courage and patience and intelligence and modesty is verified in","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"125",1726,"the course of the dialogue. His courage is shown by his behaviour in the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"126",1726,"battle, and his other qualities shine forth as the argument proceeds.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"127",1726,"Socrates takes an evident delight in 'the wise Theaetetus,' who has more","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"128",1726,"in him than 'many bearded men'; he is quite inspired by his answers. At","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"129",1726,"first the youth is lost in wonder, and is almost too modest to speak,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"130",1726,"but, encouraged by Socrates, he rises to the occasion, and grows full of","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"131",1726,"interest and enthusiasm about the great question. Like a youth, he has","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"132",1726,"not finally made up his mind, and is very ready to follow the lead of","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"133",1726,"Socrates, and to enter into each successive phase of the discussion","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"134",1726,"which turns up. His great dialectical talent is shown in his power of","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"135",1726,"drawing distinctions, and of foreseeing the consequences of his own","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"136",1726,"answers. The enquiry about the nature of knowledge is not new to him;","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"137",1726,"long ago he has felt the 'pang of philosophy,' and has experienced the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"138",1726,"youthful intoxication which is depicted in the Philebus. But he","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"139",1726,"has hitherto been unable to make the transition from mathematics to","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"140",1726,"metaphysics. He can form a general conception of square and oblong","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"141",1726,"numbers, but he is unable to attain a similar expression of knowledge","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"142",1726,"in the abstract. Yet at length he begins to recognize that there are","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"143",1726,"universal conceptions of being, likeness, sameness, number, which the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"144",1726,"mind contemplates in herself, and with the help of Socrates is conducted","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"145",1726,"from a theory of sense to a theory of ideas.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"146",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"147",1726,"There is no reason to doubt that Theaetetus was a real person, whose","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"148",1726,"name survived in the next generation. But neither can any importance be","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"149",1726,"attached to the notices of him in Suidas and Proclus, which are probably","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"150",1726,"based on the mention of him in Plato. According to a confused statement","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"151",1726,"in Suidas, who mentions him twice over, first, as a pupil of Socrates,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"152",1726,"and then of Plato, he is said to have written the first work on the Five","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"153",1726,"Solids. But no early authority cites the work, the invention of which","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"154",1726,"may have been easily suggested by the division of roots, which Plato","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"155",1726,"attributes to him, and the allusion to the backward state of solid","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"156",1726,"geometry in the Republic. At any rate, there is no occasion to recall","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"157",1726,"him to life again after the battle of Corinth, in order that we may","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"158",1726,"allow time for the completion of such a work (Muller). We may also","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"159",1726,"remark that such a supposition entirely destroys the pathetic interest","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"160",1726,"of the introduction.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"161",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"162",1726,"Theodorus, the geometrician, had once been the friend and disciple of","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"163",1726,"Protagoras, but he is very reluctant to leave his retirement and defend","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"164",1726,"his old master. He is too old to learn Socrates' game of question and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"165",1726,"answer, and prefers the digressions to the main argument, because he","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"166",1726,"finds them easier to follow. The mathematician, as Socrates says in the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"167",1726,"Republic, is not capable of giving a reason in the same manner as the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"168",1726,"dialectician, and Theodorus could not therefore have been appropriately","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"169",1726,"introduced as the chief respondent. But he may be fairly appealed to,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"170",1726,"when the honour of his master is at stake. He is the 'guardian of his","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"171",1726,"orphans,' although this is a responsibility which he wishes to throw","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"172",1726,"upon Callias, the friend and patron of all Sophists, declaring that","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"173",1726,"he himself had early 'run away' from philosophy, and was absorbed in","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"174",1726,"mathematics. His extreme dislike to the Heraclitean fanatics, which may","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"175",1726,"be compared with the dislike of Theaetetus to the materialists, and his","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"176",1726,"ready acceptance of the noble words of Socrates, are noticeable traits","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"177",1726,"of character.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"178",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"179",1726,"The Socrates of the Theaetetus is the same as the Socrates of the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"180",1726,"earlier dialogues. He is the invincible disputant, now advanced in","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"181",1726,"years, of the Protagoras and Symposium; he is still pursuing his divine","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"182",1726,"mission, his 'Herculean labours,' of which he has described the origin","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"183",1726,"in the Apology; and he still hears the voice of his oracle, bidding him","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"184",1726,"receive or not receive the truant souls. There he is supposed to have","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"185",1726,"a mission to convict men of self-conceit; in the Theaetetus he has","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"186",1726,"assigned to him by God the functions of a man-midwife, who delivers men","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"187",1726,"of their thoughts, and under this character he is present throughout the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"188",1726,"dialogue. He is the true prophet who has an insight into the natures","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"189",1726,"of men, and can divine their future; and he knows that sympathy is the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"190",1726,"secret power which unlocks their thoughts. The hit at Aristides, the son","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"191",1726,"of Lysimachus, who was specially committed to his charge in the Laches,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"192",1726,"may be remarked by the way. The attempt to discover the definition","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"193",1726,"of knowledge is in accordance with the character of Socrates as he","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"194",1726,"is described in the Memorabilia, asking What is justice? what is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"195",1726,"temperance? and the like. But there is no reason to suppose that he","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"196",1726,"would have analyzed the nature of perception, or traced the connexion","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"197",1726,"of Protagoras and Heracleitus, or have raised the difficulty respecting","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"198",1726,"false opinion. The humorous illustrations, as well as the serious","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"199",1726,"thoughts, run through the dialogue. The snubnosedness of Theaetetus, a","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"200",1726,"characteristic which he shares with Socrates, and the man-midwifery","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"201",1726,"of Socrates, are not forgotten in the closing words. At the end of the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"202",1726,"dialogue, as in the Euthyphro, he is expecting to meet Meletus at the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"203",1726,"porch of the king Archon; but with the same indifference to the result","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"204",1726,"which is everywhere displayed by him, he proposes that they shall","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"205",1726,"reassemble on the following day at the same spot. The day comes, and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"206",1726,"in the Sophist the three friends again meet, but no further allusion is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"207",1726,"made to the trial, and the principal share in the argument is assigned,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"208",1726,"not to Socrates, but to an Eleatic stranger; the youthful Theaetetus","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"209",1726,"also plays a different and less independent part. And there is no","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"210",1726,"allusion in the Introduction to the second and third dialogues, which","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"211",1726,"are afterwards appended. There seems, therefore, reason to think that","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"212",1726,"there is a real change, both in the characters and in the design.","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"213",1726,"","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"214",1726,"The dialogue is an enquiry into the nature of knowledge, which is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"215",1726,"interrupted by two digressions. The first is the digression about the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"216",1726,"midwives, which is also a leading thought or continuous image, like the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"217",1726,"wave in the Republic, appearing and reappearing at intervals. Again and","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"218",1726,"again we are reminded that the successive conceptions of knowledge are","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"219",1726,"extracted from Theaetetus, who in his turn truly declares that Socrates","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"220",1726,"has got a great deal more out of him than ever was in him. Socrates is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"354",1726,"Protagoras, rather than with Socrates, in the dialogue which is","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"679",1726,"or he may be well,--and remember that Socrates, with all his accidents,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"1238",1726,"of which no further explanation can be given. And how can any one","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"1239",1726,"be ignorant of either of them, and yet know both of them? There is,","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"1240",1726,"however, another alternative:--We may suppose that the syllable has a","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"1241",1726,"separate form or idea distinct from the letters or parts. The all of the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"1242",1726,"parts may not be the whole. Theaetetus is very much inclined to adopt","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"1243",1726,"this suggestion, but when interrogated by Socrates he is unable to","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"1244",1726,"draw any distinction between the whole and all the parts. And if the","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"1245",1726,"syllables have no parts, then they are those original elements of which","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"1246",1726,"there is no explanation. But how can the syllable be known if the letter","Theaetetus","Plato","Philosophy","en"
