"155",1751,"great black bird as silent as night. The soldier did not tarry to look","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"156",1751,"or to think. As the bird flew by up came the gun to his shoulder, squint","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"161",1751,"terrible that it curdled the very blood in his veins and made his hair","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"162",1751,"stand upon end. Away it flew like a flash--a bird no longer, but a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"163",1751,"great, black demon, smoking and smelling most horribly of brimstone,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"164",1751,"and when the soldier gathered his wits, there lay the feather cap and a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"169",1751,"the feather cap into one pocket and the round stone into another, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"170",1751,"shouldering his musket marched away until he reached the town-gate, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"199",1751,"he walked without so much as a rap at the door, and so led the way to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"200",1751,"a great room with furnaces and books and bottles and jars and dust and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"201",1751,"cobwebs, and three grinning skulls upon the mantelpiece, each with a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"202",1751,"candle stuck atop of it, and there he left the soldier while he went to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"207",1751,"as any he had seen in all of his life, for it smelled musty and dusty,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"208",1751,"it did: the three skulls grinned at him, and he began to think that the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"209",1751,"little old man was no better than he should be. ""I wish,"" says he, at","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"210",1751,"last, ""that instead of being here I might be well out of my scrape and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"219",1751,"words left his lips when--whisk! whir!--away flew the stool through the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"220",1751,"window, so suddenly that the soldier had only just time enough to gripe","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"221",1751,"it tight by the legs to save himself from falling. Whir! whiz!--away it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"222",1751,"flew like a bullet. Up and up it went--so high in the air that the earth","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"225",1751,"at last it settled as light as a feather upon a balcony of the king's","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"229",1751,"There he sat upon the stool for a long time without daring to move, for","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"231",1751,"by-and-by his ears got cold in the night air, and then he noticed for","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"232",1751,"the first time that he had lost his head gear, and bethought himself of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"233",1751,"the feather cap in his pocket. So out he drew it and clapped it upon his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"234",1751,"head, and then--lo and behold!--he found he had become as invisible as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"235",1751,"thin air--not a shred or a hair of him could be seen. ""Well!"" said he,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"236",1751,"""here is another wonder, but I am safe now at any rate."" And up he got","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"237",1751,"to find some place not so cool as where he sat.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"238",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"239",1751,"He stepped in at an open window, and there he found himself in a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"240",1751,"beautiful room, hung with cloth of silver and blue, and with chairs and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"241",1751,"tables of white and gold; dozens and scores of waxlights shone like so","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"242",1751,"many stars, and lit every crack and cranny as bright as day, and there","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"243",1751,"at one end of the room upon a couch, with her eyelids closed and fast","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"244",1751,"asleep, lay the prettiest princess that ever the sun shone upon. The","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"245",1751,"soldier stood and looked and looked at her, and looked and looked at","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"246",1751,"her, until his heart melted within him like soft butter, and then he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"247",1751,"kissed her.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"248",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"249",1751,"""Who is that?"" said the princess, starting up, wide-awake, but not a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"250",1751,"soul could she see, because the soldier had the feather cap upon his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"251",1751,"head.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"252",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"253",1751,"""It is I,"" said he, ""and I am King of the Wind, and ten times greater","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"254",1751,"than the greatest of kings here below. One day I saw you walking in your","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"255",1751,"garden and fell in love with you, and now I have come to ask you if you","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"256",1751,"will marry me and be my wife?""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"257",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"259",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"260",1751,"""You shall see me,"" said the soldier, ""all in good time. Three days","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"261",1751,"from now I will come again, and will show myself to you, but just now it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"263",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"266",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"267",1751,"Thereupon the soldier kissed her and said good-bye, and then stepped","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"268",1751,"out of the window as he had stepped in. He sat him down upon his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"269",1751,"three-legged stool. ""I wish,"" said he, ""to be carried to such and such a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"270",1751,"tavern."" For he had been in that town before, and knew the places where","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"273",1751,"Whir! whiz! away flew the stool as high and higher than it had flown","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"274",1751,"before, and then down it came again, and down and down until it lit as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"275",1751,"light as a feather in the street before the tavern door. The soldier","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"276",1751,"tucked his feather cap in his pocket, and the three-legged stool under","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"277",1751,"his arm, and in he went and ordered a pot of beer and some white bread","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"278",1751,"and cheese.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"279",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"280",1751,"Meantime, at the king's palace was such a gossiping and such a hubbub as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"281",1751,"had not been heard there for many a day; for the pretty princess was not","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"282",1751,"slow in telling how the invisible King of the Wind had come and asked","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"283",1751,"her to marry him; and some said it was true and some said it was not","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"284",1751,"true, and everybody wondered and talked, and told their own notions of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"285",1751,"the matter. But all agreed that three days would show whether what had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"286",1751,"been told was true or no.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"287",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"288",1751,"As for the soldier, he knew no more how to do what he had promised to do","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"289",1751,"than my grandmother's cat; for where was he to get clothes fine enough","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"290",1751,"for the King of the Wind to wear? So there he sat on his three-legged","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"291",1751,"stool thinking and thinking, and if he had known all that I know he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"292",1751,"would not have given two turns of his wit upon it. ""I wish,"" says he, at","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"293",1751,"last--""I wish that this stool could help me now as well as it can carry","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"294",1751,"me through the sky. I wish,"" says he, ""that I had a suit of clothes such","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"296",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"297",1751,"The wonders of the three-legged stool were wonders indeed!","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"299",1751,"Hardly had the words left the soldier's lips when down came something","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"300",1751,"tumbling about his ears from up in the air; and what should it be but","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"301",1751,"just such a suit of clothes as he had in his mind--all crusted over with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"302",1751,"gold and silver and jewels.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"303",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"304",1751,"""Well,"" says the soldier, as soon as he had got over his wonder again,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"306",1751,"I, if I had been in his place, and had a few minutes to think of all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"307",1751,"that I wanted.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"308",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"309",1751,"So he found out the trick of the stool, and after that wishing and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"310",1751,"having were easy enough, and by the time the three days were ended the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"311",1751,"real King of the Wind himself could not have cut a finer figure. Then","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"312",1751,"down sat the soldier upon his stool, and wished himself at the king's","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"313",1751,"palace. Away he flew through the air, and by-and-by there he was, just","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"314",1751,"where he had been before. He put his feather cap upon his head, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"315",1751,"stepped in through the window, and there he found the princess with her","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"316",1751,"father, the king, and her mother, the queen, and all the great lords and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"317",1751,"nobles waiting for his coming; but never a stitch nor a hair did they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"318",1751,"see of him until he stood in the very midst of them all. Then he whipped","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"319",1751,"the feather cap off of his head, and there he was, shining with silver","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"320",1751,"and gold and glistening with jewels--such a sight as man's eyes never","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"321",1751,"saw before.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"322",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"323",1751,"""Take her,"" said the king, ""she is yours."" And the soldier looked so","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"324",1751,"handsome in his fine clothes that the princess was as glad to hear those","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"325",1751,"words as any she had ever listened to in all of her life.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"326",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"329",1751,"""Very well,"" said the soldier. ""Only give me a plot of ground to build","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"330",1751,"a palace upon that shall be fit for the wife of the King of the Wind to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"331",1751,"live in.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"333",1751,"""You shall have it,"" said the king, ""and it shall be the great parade","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"334",1751,"ground back of the palace, which is so wide and long that all my army","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"335",1751,"can march round and round in it without getting into its own way; and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"336",1751,"that ought to be big enough.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"337",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"338",1751,"""Yes,"" said the soldier, ""it is."" Thereupon he put on his feather cap","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"339",1751,"and disappeared from the sight of all as quickly as one might snuff out","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"340",1751,"a candle.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"341",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"342",1751,"He mounted his three-legged stool and away he flew through the air until","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"343",1751,"he had come again to the tavern where he was lodging. There he sat him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"344",1751,"down and began to churn his thoughts, and the butter he made was worth","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"345",1751,"the having, I can tell you. He wished for a grand palace of white","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"346",1751,"marble, and then he wished for all sorts of things to fill it--the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"347",1751,"finest that could be had. Then he wished for servants in clothes of gold","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"348",1751,"and silver, and then he wished for fine horses and gilded coaches.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"349",1751,"Then he wished for gardens and orchards and lawns and flower-plats and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"350",1751,"fountains, and all kinds and sorts of things, until the sweat ran down","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"351",1751,"his face from hard thinking and wishing. And as he thought and wished,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"352",1751,"all the things he thought and wished for grew up like soap-bubbles from","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"353",1751,"nothing at all.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"354",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"355",1751,"Then, when day began to break, he wished himself with his fine clothes","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"356",1751,"to be in the palace that his own wits had made, and away he flew through","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"357",1751,"the air until he had come there safe and sound.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"358",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"359",1751,"But when the sun rose and shone down upon the beautiful palace and all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"360",1751,"the gardens and orchards around it, the king and queen and all the court","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"361",1751,"stood dumb with wonder at the sight. Then, as they stood staring, the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"362",1751,"gates opened and out came the soldier riding in his gilded coach with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"363",1751,"his servants in silver and gold marching beside him, and such a sight","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"364",1751,"the daylight never looked upon before that day.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"365",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"366",1751,"Well, the princess and the soldier were married, and if no couple had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"367",1751,"ever been happy in the world before, they were then. Nothing was heard","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"368",1751,"but feasting and merrymaking, and at night all the sky was lit with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"369",1751,"fireworks. Such a wedding had never been before, and all the world was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"370",1751,"glad that it had happened.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"371",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"372",1751,"That is, all the world but one; that one was the old man dressed in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"373",1751,"scarlet that the soldier had met when he first came to town. While all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"374",1751,"the rest were in the hubbub of rejoicing, he put on his thinking-cap,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"375",1751,"and by-and-by began to see pretty well how things lay, and that, as they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"376",1751,"say in our town, there was a fly in the milk-jug. ""Ho, ho!"" thought he,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"377",1751,"""so the soldier has found out all about the three-legged stool, has he?","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"378",1751,"Well, I will just put a spoke into his wheel for him."" And so he began","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"379",1751,"to watch for his chance to do the soldier an ill turn.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"380",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"381",1751,"Now, a week or two after the wedding, and after all the gay doings had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"382",1751,"ended, a grand hunt was declared, and the king and his new son-in-law","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"383",1751,"and all the court went to it. That was just such a chance as the old","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"384",1751,"magician had been waiting for; so the night before the hunting-party","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"385",1751,"returned he climbed the walls of the garden, and so came to the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"386",1751,"wonderful palace that the soldier had built out of nothing at all, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"387",1751,"there stood three men keeping guard so that no one might enter.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"388",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"389",1751,"But little that troubled the magician. He began to mutter spells and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"390",1751,"strange words, and all of a sudden he was gone, and in his place was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"391",1751,"a great black ant, for he had changed himself into an ant. In he ran","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"392",1751,"through a crack of the door (and mischief has got into many a man's","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"393",1751,"house through a smaller hole for the matter of that). In and out ran the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"394",1751,"ant through one room and another, and up and down and here and there,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"395",1751,"until at last in a far-away part of the magic palace he found the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"396",1751,"three-legged stool, and if I had been in the soldier's place I would","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"397",1751,"have chopped it up into kindling-wood after I had gotten all that I","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"398",1751,"wanted. But there it was, and in an instant the magician resumed his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"399",1751,"own shape. Down he sat him upon the stool. ""I wish,"" said he, ""that this","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"400",1751,"palace and the princess and all who are within it, together with its","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"401",1751,"orchards and its lawns and its gardens and everything, may be removed to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"402",1751,"such and such a country, upon the other side of the earth.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"403",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"404",1751,"And as the stool had obeyed the soldier, so everything was done now just","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"405",1751,"as the magician said.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"406",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"407",1751,"The next morning back came the hunting-party, and as they rode over the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"408",1751,"hill--lo and behold!--there lay stretched out the great parade ground","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"409",1751,"in which the king's armies used to march around and around, and the land","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"410",1751,"was as bare as the palm of my hand. Not a stick or a stone of the palace","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"411",1751,"was left; not a leaf or a blade of the orchards or gardens was to be","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"412",1751,"seen.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"413",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"414",1751,"The soldier sat as dumb as a fish, and the king stared with eyes and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"415",1751,"mouth wide open. ""Where is the palace, and where is my daughter?"" said","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"416",1751,"he, at last, finding words and wit.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"417",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"418",1751,"""I do not know,"" said the soldier.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"419",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"420",1751,"The king's face grew as black as thunder. ""You do not know?"" he said,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"421",1751,"""then you must find out. Seize the traitor!"" he cried.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"422",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"423",1751,"But that was easier said than done, for, quick as a wink, as they came","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"424",1751,"to lay hold of him, the soldier whisked the feather cap from his pocket","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"425",1751,"and clapped it upon his head, and then they might as well have hoped to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"426",1751,"find the south wind in winter as to find him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"427",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"428",1751,"But though he got safe away from that trouble he was deep enough in the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"429",1751,"dumps, you may be sure of that. Away he went, out into the wide world,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"430",1751,"leaving that town behind him. Away he went, until by-and-by he came to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"431",1751,"a great forest, and for three days he travelled on and on--he knew not","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"432",1751,"whither. On the third night, as he sat beside a fire which he had built","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"433",1751,"to keep him warm, he suddenly bethought himself of the little round","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"434",1751,"stone which had dropped from the bird's claw, and which he still had in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"435",1751,"his pocket. ""Why should it not also help me,"" said he, ""for there must","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"436",1751,"be some wonder about it."" So he brought it out, and sat looking at it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"437",1751,"and looking at it, but he could make nothing of it for the life of him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"438",1751,"Nevertheless, it might have some wishing power about it, like the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"439",1751,"magic stool. ""I wish,"" said the soldier, ""that I might get out of this","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"440",1751,"scrape."" That is what we have all wished many and many a time in a like","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"441",1751,"case; but just now it did the soldier no more good to wish than it does","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"442",1751,"good for the rest of us. ""Bah!"" said he, ""it is nothing but a black","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"443",1751,"stone after all."" And then he threw it into the fire.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"444",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"445",1751,"Puff! Bang! Away flew the embers upon every side, and back tumbled the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"446",1751,"soldier, and there in the middle of the flame stood just such a grim,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"476",1751,"soldier had eaten, the princess told him all that had happened to her;","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"477",1751,"how the magician had found the stool, and how he had transported the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"512",1751,"place there stood a lion with bristling mane and flaming eyes--a sight","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"537",1751,"wishing, back flew palace and garden and all through the air again to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1553",1751,"prying sort, and liked more than a little to know all that was to be","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1554",1751,"known about this or that or the other thing that he chanced to see or","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1555",1751,"hear. ""I wonder where Ill-Luck can be, to be in such a tight place as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1558",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1559",1751,"""Here I am,"" says Ill-Luck--""here in this hazel-nut, under the roots of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1563",1751,"poking and prying under the roots until he found the nut. Then he began","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1564",1751,"twisting and turning it in his fingers, looking first on one side and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1565",1751,"then on the other, and all the while Ill-Luck kept crying, ""Let me out!","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1566",1751,"let me out!""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1567",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1568",1751,"It was not long before the Fiddler found the little wooden plug, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1569",1751,"then nothing would do but he must take a peep inside the nut to see if","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1570",1751,"Ill-Luck was really there. So he picked and pulled at the wooden plug,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1571",1751,"until at last out it came; and--phst! pop! out came Ill-Luck along with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1573",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1577",1751,"in that hazel-nut, and you are the man that has let me out; for once","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1578",1751,"in a way I will do a good turn to a poor human body."" Therewith, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1579",1751,"without giving the Fiddler time to speak a word, Ill-Luck caught him up","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1580",1751,"by the belt, and--whiz! away he flew like a bullet, over hill and over","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1581",1751,"valley; over moor and over mountain, so fast that not enough wind was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1582",1751,"left in the Fiddler's stomach to say ""Bo!""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1583",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1584",1751,"By-and-by he came to a garden, and there he let the Fiddler drop on","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1585",1751,"the soft grass below. Then away he flew to attend to other matters of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1586",1751,"greater need.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1587",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1588",1751,"When the Fiddler had gathered his wits together, and himself to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1589",1751,"his feet, he saw that he lay in a beautiful garden of flowers and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1590",1751,"fruit-trees and marble walks and what not, and that at the end of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1591",1751,"it stood a great, splendid house, all built of white marble, with a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1592",1751,"fountain in front, and peacocks strutting about on the lawn.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1593",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1594",1751,"Well, the Fiddler smoothed down his hair and brushed his clothes a bit,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1595",1751,"and off he went to see what was to be seen at the grand house at the end","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1596",1751,"of the garden.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1597",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1598",1751,"He entered the door, and nobody said no to him. Then he passed through","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1599",1751,"one room after another, and each was finer than the one he left behind.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1600",1751,"Many servants stood around; but they only bowed, and never asked whence","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1601",1751,"he came. At last he came to a room where a little old man sat at a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1602",1751,"table. The table was spread with a feast that smelled so good that it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1603",1751,"brought tears to the Fiddler's eyes and water to his mouth, and all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1604",1751,"the plates were of pure gold. The little old man sat alone, but another","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1605",1751,"place was spread, as though he were expecting some one. As the Fiddler","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1606",1751,"came in the little old man nodded and smiled. ""Welcome!"" he cried; ""and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1607",1751,"have you come at last?""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1608",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1609",1751,"""Yes,"" said the Fiddler, ""I have. It was Ill-Luck that brought me.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1610",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1611",1751,"""Nay,"" said the little old man, ""do not say that. Sit down to the table","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1612",1751,"and eat; and when I have told you all, you will say it was not Ill-Luck,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1613",1751,"but Good-Luck, that brought you.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1614",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1615",1751,"The Fiddler had his own mind about that; but, all the same, down he sat","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1616",1751,"at the table, and fell to with knife and fork at the good things, as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1617",1751,"though he had not had a bite to eat for a week of Sundays.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1618",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1619",1751,"""I am the richest man in the world,"" says the little old man, after a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1623",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1624",1751,"""You may well be,"" said the old man, ""for I am all alone in the world,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1625",1751,"and without wife or child. And this morning I said to myself that the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1626",1751,"first body that came to my house I would take for a son--or a daughter,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1627",1751,"as the case might be. You are the first, and so you shall live with me","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1628",1751,"as long as I live, and after I am gone everything that I have shall be","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1630",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1631",1751,"The Fiddler did nothing but stare with open eyes and mouth, as though he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1632",1751,"would never shut either again.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1633",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1634",1751,"Well, the Fiddler lived with the old man for maybe three or four days as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1635",1751,"snug and happy a life as ever a mouse passed in a green cheese. As for","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1636",1751,"the gold and silver and jewels--why, they were as plentiful in that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1637",1751,"house as dust in a mill! Everything the Fiddler wanted came to his hand.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1638",1751,"He lived high, and slept soft and warm, and never knew what it was to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1639",1751,"want either more or less, or great or small. In all of those three or","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1640",1751,"four days he did nothing but enjoy himself with might and main.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1641",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1642",1751,"But by-and-by he began to wonder where all the good things came from.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1643",1751,"Then, before long, he fell to pestering the old man with questions about","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1644",1751,"the matter.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1645",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1646",1751,"At first the old man put him off with short answers, but the Fiddler was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1647",1751,"a master-hand at finding out anything he wanted to know. He dinned and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1648",1751,"drummed and worried until flesh and blood could stand it no longer. So","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1649",1751,"at last the old man said that he would show him the treasure-house where","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1650",1751,"all his wealth came from, and at that the Fiddler was tickled beyond","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1651",1751,"measure.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1652",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1653",1751,"The old man took a key from behind the door and led him out into the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1654",1751,"garden. There in a corner by the wall was a great trap-door of iron. The","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1655",1751,"old man fitted the key to the lock and turned it. He lifted the door,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1656",1751,"and then went down a steep flight of stone steps, and the Fiddler","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1657",1751,"followed close at his heels. Down below it was as light as day, for in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1658",1751,"the centre of the room hung a great lamp that shone with a bright light","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1659",1751,"and lit up all the place as bright as day. In the floor were set three","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1660",1751,"great basins of marble: one was nearly full of silver, one of gold, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1661",1751,"one of gems of all sorts.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1662",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1663",1751,"""All this is mine,"" said the old man, ""and after I am gone it shall be","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1664",1751,"yours. It was left to me as I will leave it to you, and in the meantime","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1665",1751,"you may come and go as you choose and fill your pockets whenever you","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1666",1751,"wish to. But there is one thing you must not do: you must never open","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1667",1751,"that door yonder at the back of the room. Should you do so, Ill-Luck","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1668",1751,"will be sure to overtake you.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1669",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1670",1751,"Oh no! The Fiddler would never think of doing such a thing as opening","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1671",1751,"the door. The silver and gold and jewels were enough for him. But since","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1672",1751,"the old man had given him leave, he would just help himself to a few of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1673",1751,"the fine things. So he stuffed his pockets full, and then he followed","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1674",1751,"the old man up the steps and out into the sunlight again.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1675",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1676",1751,"It took him maybe an hour to count all the money and jewels he had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1677",1751,"brought up with him. After he had done that, he began to wonder what was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1678",1751,"inside of the little door at the back of the room. First he wondered;","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1679",1751,"then he began to grow curious; then he began to itch and tingle and burn","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1680",1751,"as though fifty thousand I-want-to-know nettles were sticking into him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1681",1751,"from top to toe. At last he could stand it no longer. ""I'll just go down","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1682",1751,"yonder,"" says he, ""and peep through the key-hole; perhaps I can see what","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1683",1751,"is there without opening the door.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1684",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1685",1751,"So down he took the key, and off he marched to the garden. He opened the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1686",1751,"trap-door, and went down the steep steps to the room below. There was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1687",1751,"the door at the end of the room, but when he came to look there was no","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1688",1751,"key-hole to it. ""Pshaw!"" said he, ""here is a pretty state of affairs.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1689",1751,"Tut! tut! tut! Well, since I have come so far, it would be a pity to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1690",1751,"turn back without seeing more."" So he opened the door and peeped in.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1691",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1692",1751,"""Pooh!"" said the Fiddler, ""There's nothing there, after all,"" and he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1693",1751,"opened the door wide.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1694",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1695",1751,"Before him was a great long passageway, and at the far end of it he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1696",1751,"could see a spark of light as though the sun were shining there. He","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1697",1751,"listened, and after a while he heard a sound like the waves beating on","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1698",1751,"the shore. ""Well,"" says he, ""this is the most curious thing I have seen","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1699",1751,"for a long time. Since I have come so far, I may as well see the end of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1700",1751,"it."" So he entered the passageway, and closed the door behind him. He","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1701",1751,"went on and on, and the spark of light kept growing larger and larger,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1702",1751,"and by-and-by--pop! out he came at the other end of the passage.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1703",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1704",1751,"Sure enough, there he stood on the sea-shore, with the waves beating and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1705",1751,"dashing on the rocks. He stood looking and wondering to find himself in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1706",1751,"such a place, when all of a sudden something came with a whiz and a rush","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1707",1751,"and caught him by the belt, and away he flew like a bullet.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1708",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1709",1751,"By-and-by he managed to screw his head around and look up, and there it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1710",1751,"was Ill-Luck that had him. ""I thought so,"" said the Fiddler; and then he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1711",1751,"gave over kicking.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1712",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1713",1751,"Well; on and on they flew, over hill and valley, over moor and mountain,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1714",1751,"until they came to another garden, and there Ill-Luck let the Fiddler","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1715",1751,"drop.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1716",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1717",1751,"Swash! Down he fell into the top of an apple-tree, and there he hung in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1718",1751,"the branches.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1719",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1720",1751,"It was the garden of a royal castle, and all had been weeping and woe","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1721",1751,"(though they were beginning now to pick up their smiles again), and this","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1722",1751,"was the reason why:","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1723",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1724",1751,"The king of that country had died, and no one was left behind him but","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1725",1751,"the queen. But she was a prize, for not only was the kingdom hers, but","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1726",1751,"she was as young as a spring apple and as pretty as a picture; so that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1727",1751,"there was no end of those who would have liked to have had her, each man","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1728",1751,"for his own. Even that day there were three princes at the castle, each","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1729",1751,"one wanting the queen to marry him; and the wrangling and bickering and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1730",1751,"squabbling that was going on was enough to deafen a body. The poor young","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1731",1751,"queen was tired to death with it all, and so she had come out into","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1732",1751,"the garden for a bit of rest; and there she sat under the shade of an","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1733",1751,"apple-tree, fanning herself and crying, when--","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1734",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1735",1751,"Swash! Down fell the Fiddler into the apple-tree and down fell a dozen","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1736",1751,"apples, popping and tumbling about the queen's ears.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1737",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1738",1751,"The queen looked up and screamed, and the Fiddler climbed down.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1739",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1740",1751,"""Where did you come from?"" said she.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1741",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1742",1751,"""Oh, Ill-Luck brought me,"" said the Fiddler.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1743",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1744",1751,"""Nay,"" said the queen, ""do not say so. You fell from heaven, for I saw","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1745",1751,"it with my eyes and heard it with my ears. I see how it is now. You were","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1746",1751,"sent hither from heaven to be my husband, and my husband you shall be.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1747",1751,"You shall be king of this country, half-and-half with me as queen, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1748",1751,"shall sit on a throne beside me.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1749",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1750",1751,"You can guess whether or not that was music to the Fiddler's ears.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1751",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1752",1751,"So the princes were sent packing, and the Fiddler was married to the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1753",1751,"queen, and reigned in that country.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1754",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1755",1751,"Well, three or four days passed, and all was as sweet and happy as a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1756",1751,"spring day. But at the end of that time the Fiddler began to wonder what","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1757",1751,"was to be seen in the castle. The queen was very fond of him, and was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1758",1751,"glad enough to show him all the fine things that were to be seen; so","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1759",1751,"hand in hand they went everywhere, from garret to cellar.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1760",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1761",1751,"But you should have seen how splendid it all was! The Fiddler felt more","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1988",1751,"as the master led the way and he followed, he passed through","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1989",1751,"four-and-twenty rooms, each one more wonderful than the other.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1990",1751,"Everywhere was gold and silver and dazzling jewels that glistened so","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2000",1751,"in one hand and laid the other upon the latch of the door. Then he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2001",1751,"turned to Gebhart and spoke for the first time since they had started","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2009",1751,"Bring the water straightway, and sprinkle my face with it, and when that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2025",1751,"It was a dreadful battle between the master and the cock. Up and down","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2026",1751,"they fought, and here and there. Sometimes the student could see the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2027",1751,"wise man whirling and striking with his sword; and then again he would","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2028",1751,"be hidden in a sheet of flame. But after a while he made a lucky stroke,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2029",1751,"and off flew the cock's head. Then, lo and behold! instead of a cock it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2030",1751,"was a great, hairy, black demon that lay dead on the floor.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2032",1751,"But, though the master had conquered, he looked like one sorely sick. He","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2033",1751,"was just able to stagger to a couch that stood by the wall, and there he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2034",1751,"fell and lay, without breath or motion, like one dead, and as white as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2040",1751,"The door of it was also of iron. He opened it and passed within, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2041",1751,"there saw two great tables or blocks of polished marble. Upon one was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2042",1751,"the dagger and a goblet of gold brimming with water. Upon the other lay","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2043",1751,"the figure of a woman, and as Gebhart looked at her he thought her more","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2044",1751,"beautiful than any thought or dream could picture. But her eyes were","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2045",1751,"closed, and she lay like a lifeless figure of wax.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2046",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2047",1751,"After Gebhart had gazed at her a long, long time, he took up the goblet","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2050",1751,"Then, before he left that place, he thought that he would have just one","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2051",1751,"more look at the beautiful figure. So he did, and gazed and gazed until","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2052",1751,"his heart melted away within him like a lump of butter; and, hardly","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2053",1751,"knowing what he did, he stooped and kissed the lips.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2055",1751,"Instantly he did so a great humming sound filled the whole castle, so","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2056",1751,"sweet and musical that it made him tremble to listen. Then suddenly the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2080",1751,"saw his face she cried out in a loud voice: ""It is the great master!","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2087",1751,"sleeping; if you sprinkle that water upon him he will awaken, young,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2201",1751,"beautiful birds and winged figures so life-like that no one could tell","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2202",1751,"that they were only painted, and not real. At the farther side of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2203",1751,"room were two richly cushioned couches, and thither the old man led the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2204",1751,"way with the young spendthrift following, wonder-struck, and there the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2205",1751,"two sat themselves down. Then the old man smote his hands together, and,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2206",1751,"in answer, ten young men and ten beautiful girls entered bearing a feast","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2207",1751,"of rare fruits and wines which they spread before them, and the young","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2208",1751,"man, who had been fasting since morning, fell to and ate as he had not","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2209",1751,"eaten for many a day.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2210",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2211",1751,"The old man, who himself ate but little, waited patiently for the other","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2212",1751,"to end. ""Now,"" said he, as soon as the young man could eat no more, ""you","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2213",1751,"have feasted and you have drunk; it is time for us to work.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2215",1751,"Thereupon he rose from the couch and led the way, the young man","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2216",1751,"following, through an arch door-way into a garden, in the centre of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2217",1751,"which was an open space paved with white marble, and in the centre of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2218",1751,"that again a carpet, ragged and worn, spread out upon the smooth stones.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2219",1751,"Without saying a word, the old man seated himself upon one end of this","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2220",1751,"carpet, and motioned to the spendthrift to seat himself with his basket","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2221",1751,"at the other end; then--","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2222",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2223",1751,"""Are you ready?"" said the old man.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2227",1751,"""Then, by the horn of Jacob,"" said the old man, ""I command thee, O","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2230",1751,"away flew the carpet, swifter than the swiftest wind, carrying the old","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2231",1751,"man and the young spendthrift, until at last it brought them to a rocky","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2232",1751,"desert without leaf or blade of grass to be seen far or near. Then it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2233",1751,"descended to where there was a circle of sand as smooth as a floor.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2234",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2235",1751,"The old man rolled up the carpet, and then drew from a pouch that hung","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2236",1751,"at his side a box, and from the box some sticks of sandal and spice","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2237",1751,"woods, with which he built a little fire. Next he drew from the same","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2238",1751,"pouch a brazen jar, from which he poured a gray powder upon the blaze.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2239",1751,"Instantly there leaped up a great flame of white light and a cloud of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2240",1751,"smoke, which rose high in the air, and there spread out until it hid","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2241",1751,"everything from sight. Then the old man began to mutter spells, and in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2242",1751,"answer the earth shook and quaked, and a rumbling as of thunder filled","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2243",1751,"the air. At last he gave a loud cry, and instantly the earth split open,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2244",1751,"and there the young spendthrift saw a trap-door of iron, in which was an","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2245",1751,"iron ring to lift it by.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2246",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2247",1751,"""Look!"" said the old man. ""Yonder is the task for which I have brought","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2248",1751,"you; lift for me that trap-door of iron, for it is too heavy for me to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2250",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2251",1751,"And it was no small task, either, for, stout and strong as the young man","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2252",1751,"was, it was all he could do to lift up the iron plate. But at last up","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2253",1751,"it swung, and down below he saw a flight of stone steps leading into the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2254",1751,"earth.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2255",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2256",1751,"The old man drew from his bosom a copper lamp, which he lit at the fire","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2257",1751,"of the sandal and spice wood sticks, which had now nearly died away.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2258",1751,"Then, leading the way, with the young man following close at his heels,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2259",1751,"he descended the stairway that led down below. At the bottom the two","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2260",1751,"entered a great vaulted room, carved out of the solid stone, upon the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2261",1751,"walls of which were painted strange pictures in bright colors of kings","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2262",1751,"and queens, genii and dragons. Excepting for these painted figures, the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2263",1751,"vaulted room was perfectly bare, only that in the centre of the floor","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2264",1751,"there stood three stone tables. Upon the first table stood an iron","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2265",1751,"candlestick with three branches; upon the second stood an earthen jar,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2266",1751,"empty of everything but dust; upon the third stood a brass bowl, a yard","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2267",1751,"wide and a yard deep, and filled to the brim with shining, gleaming,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2268",1751,"dazzling jewels of all sorts.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2269",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2270",1751,"""Now,"" said the old man to the spendthrift, ""I will do to you as I","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2271",1751,"promised: I will pay you as never man was paid before for such a task.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2272",1751,"Yonder upon those three stone tables are three great treasures: choose","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2274",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2275",1751,"""I shall not be long in choosing,"" cried the young spendthrift. ""I shall","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2277",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2278",1751,"The old man laughed. ""So be it,"" said he. ""Fill your basket from the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2279",1751,"bowl with all you can carry, and that will be enough, provided you live","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2281",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2282",1751,"The young man needed no second bidding, but began filling his basket","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2283",1751,"with both hands, until he had in it as much as he could carry.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2284",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2285",1751,"Then the old man, taking the iron candlestick and the earthen jar, led","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2286",1751,"the way up the stairway again. There the young man lowered the iron","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2287",1751,"trap-door to its place, and so soon as he had done so the other stamped","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2288",1751,"his heel upon the ground, and the earth closed of itself as smooth and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2290",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2291",1751,"The two sat themselves upon the carpet, the one upon the one end, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2295",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2296",1751,"Away flew the carpet, and in a little time they were back in the garden","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2297",1751,"from which they had started upon their journey; and there they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2298",1751,"parted company. ""Go thy way, young man,"" said the old graybeard, ""and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2300",1751,"I know well who thou art, and how thou hast lived. Shun thy evil","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2303",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2304",1751,"""Have no fear,"" cried the young man, joyfully. ""I have learned a bitter","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2306",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2307",1751,"So, filled with good resolves, the young man went the next day to his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2308",1751,"creditors and paid his debts; he bought back the house which his father","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2309",1751,"had left him, and there began to lead a new life as he had promised.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2310",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2311",1751,"But a gray goose does not become white, nor a foolish man a wise one.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2312",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2313",1751,"At first he led a life sober enough; but by little and little he began","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2314",1751,"to take up with his old-time friends again, and by-and-by the money went","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2315",1751,"flying as merrily as ever, only this time he was twenty times richer","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2316",1751,"than he had been before, and he spent his money twenty times as fast.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2317",1751,"Every day there was feasting and drinking going on in his house, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2318",1751,"roaring and rioting and dancing and singing. The wealth of a king could","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2319",1751,"not keep up such a life forever, so by the end of a year and a half the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2320",1751,"last of the treasure was gone, and the young spendthrift was just as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2321",1751,"poor as ever. Then once again his friends left him as they had done","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2322",1751,"before, and all that he could do was to rap his head and curse his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2323",1751,"folly.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2324",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2325",1751,"At last, one morning, he plucked up courage to go to the old man who had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2326",1751,"helped him once before, to see whether he would not help him again. Rap!","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2327",1751,"tap! tap! he knocked at the door, and who should open it but the old man","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2328",1751,"himself. ""Well,"" said the graybeard, ""what do you want?""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2329",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2330",1751,"""I want some help,"" said the spendthrift; and then he told him all, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2331",1751,"the old man listened and stroked his beard.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2332",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2333",1751,"""By rights,"" said he, when the young man had ended, ""I should leave you","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2334",1751,"alone in your folly; for it is plain to see that nothing can cure you of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2335",1751,"it. Nevertheless, as you helped me once, and as I have more than I shall","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2336",1751,"need, I will share what I have with you. Come in and shut the door.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2337",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2338",1751,"He led the way, the spendthrift following, to a little room all of bare","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2339",1751,"stone, and in which were only three things--the magic carpet, the iron","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2340",1751,"candlestick, and the earthen jar. This last the old man gave to the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2341",1751,"foolish spendthrift. ""My friend,"" said he, ""when you chose the money and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2342",1751,"jewels that day in the cavern, you chose the less for the greater. Here","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2343",1751,"is a treasure that an emperor might well envy you. Whatever you wish for","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2344",1751,"you will find by dipping your hand into the jar. Now go your way, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2345",1751,"let what was happened cure you of your folly.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2346",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2347",1751,"""It shall,"" cried the young man; ""never again will I be so foolish as I","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2348",1751,"have been!"" And thereupon he went his way with another pocketful of good","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2349",1751,"resolves.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2350",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2351",1751,"The first thing he did when he reached home was to try the virtue of his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2352",1751,"jar. ""I should like,"" said he, ""to have a handful of just such treasure","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2353",1751,"as I brought from the cavern over yonder."" He dipped his hand into","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2354",1751,"the jar, and when he brought it out again it was brimful of shining,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2355",1751,"gleaming, sparkling jewels. You can guess how he felt when he saw them.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2356",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2357",1751,"Well, this time a whole year went by, during which the young man lived","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2358",1751,"as soberly as a judge. But at the end of the twelvemonth he was so sick","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2359",1751,"of wisdom that he loathed it as one loathes bitter drink. Then by little","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2360",1751,"and little he began to take up with his old ways again, and to call his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2361",1751,"old cronies around, until at the end of another twelvemonth things were","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2362",1751,"a hundred times worse and wilder than ever; for now what he had he had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2363",1751,"without end.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2364",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2365",1751,"One day, when he and a great party of roisterers were shouting and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2366",1751,"making merry, he brought out his earthen-ware pot to show them the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2367",1751,"wonders of it; and to prove its virtue he gave to each guest whatever he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2368",1751,"wanted. ""What will you have?""--""A handful of gold.""--""Put your hand in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2369",1751,"and get it!""--""What will you have?""--""A fistful of pearls.""--""Put","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2371",1751,"diamonds.""--""Dip into the jar and get it."" And so he went from one","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2372",1751,"to another, and each and every one got what he asked for, and such a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2373",1751,"shouting and hubbub those walls had never heard before.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2374",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2375",1751,"Then the young man, holding the jar in his hands, began to dance and to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2376",1751,"sing: ""O wonderful jar! O beautiful jar! O beloved jar!"" and so on, his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2377",1751,"friends clapping their hands, and laughing and cheering him. At last,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2378",1751,"in the height of his folly, he balanced the earthen jar on his head, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2379",1751,"began dancing around and around with it to show his dexterity.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2380",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2381",1751,"Smash! crash! The precious jar lay in fifty pieces of the stone floor,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2382",1751,"and the young man stood staring at the result of his folly with bulging","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2383",1751,"eyes, while his friends roared and laughed and shouted louder than ever","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2384",1751,"over his mishap. And again his treasure and his gay life were gone.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2385",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2386",1751,"But what had been hard for him to do before was easier now. At the end","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2387",1751,"of a week he was back at the old man's house, rapping on the door.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2388",1751,"This time the old man asked him never a word, but frowned as black as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2389",1751,"thunder.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2390",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2391",1751,"""I know,"" said he, ""what has happened to you. If I were wise I should","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2392",1751,"let you alone in your folly; but once more I will have pity on you and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2393",1751,"will help you, only this time it shall be the last."" Once more he led","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2394",1751,"the way to the stone room, where were the iron candlestick and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2395",1751,"magic carpet, and with him he took a good stout cudgel. He stood the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2396",1751,"candlestick in the middle of the room, and taking three candles from his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2397",1751,"pouch, thrust one into each branch. Then he struck a light, and lit the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2398",1751,"first candle. Instantly there appeared a little old man, clad in a long","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2399",1751,"white robe, who began dancing and spinning around and around like a top.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2400",1751,"He lit the second candle, and a second old man appeared, and round and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2401",1751,"round he went, spinning like his brother. He lit the third candle, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2402",1751,"a third old man appeared. Around and around and around they spun and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2403",1751,"whirled, until the head spun and whirled to look at them. Then the old","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2404",1751,"graybeard gripped the cudgel in his hand. ""Are you ready?"" he asked.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2405",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3291",1751,"and when he saw her his heart stood still within him, and then began","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3292",1751,"fluttering like a little bird, for one so beautiful was not to be met","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3293",1751,"with in the four corners of the world. Then she was gone.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3388",1751,"there, where the king had pointed out, stood a splendid palace as white","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3405",1751,"Tailor ready for his wedding. He brought him to a marble bath of water,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3406",1751,"in which he washed away all that was coarse and ugly, and from which the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3407",1751,"little man came forth as beautiful as the sun. Then the Demon clad","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3408",1751,"him in the finest linen, and covered him with clothes such as even the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3409",1751,"emperor of India never wore. Then he smote his hands together, and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3410",1751,"wall of the tailor-shop opened as it had done twice before, and there","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3411",1751,"came forth forty slaves clad in crimson, and bearing bowls full of money","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3412",1751,"in their hands. After them came two leading a horse as white as snow,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3413",1751,"with a saddle of gold studded with diamonds and rubies and emeralds","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3414",1751,"and sapphires. After came a body-guard of twenty warriors clad in gold","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3421",1751,"a great crowd of nobles and courtiers to the palace which the Demon had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3422",1751,"built for the Tailor; and, as the princess gazed upon him, she thought","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3423",1751,"that she had never beheld so noble and handsome a man as her husband. So","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3428",1751,"teeth shone and his face turned black. ""What hast thou for me to do?""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3429",1751,"said he, and at the words the Tailor's heart began to quake, for he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3430",1751,"remembered what was to happen to him when he could find the Demon no","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3431",1751,"more work to do--that his neck was to be wrung--and now he began to see","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3432",1751,"that he had all that he could ask for in the world. Yes; what was there","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3433",1751,"to ask for now?","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3440",1751,"to twitch.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3441",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3442",1751,"Then the Tailor began to see into what a net he had fallen. He began to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3444",1751,"did not know where to look for aid. Suddenly, as he looked out of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3445",1751,"window, a thought struck him. ""Maybe,"" thought he, ""I can give the Demon","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3446",1751,"such a task that even he cannot do it. Yes, yes!"" he cried, ""I have","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3447",1751,"thought of something for you to do. Make me out yonder in front of my","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3452",1751,"""It shall be done,"" said the Demon. As he spoke he spat in the air,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3453",1751,"and instantly a thick fog arose from the earth and hid everything from","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3454",1751,"sight. Then presently from the midst of the fog there came a great","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3455",1751,"noise of chipping and hammering, of digging and delving, of rushing and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3456",1751,"gurgling. All day the noise and the fog continued, and then at sunset","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3457",1751,"the one ceased and the other cleared away. The poor Tailor looked out","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3458",1751,"the window, and when he saw what he saw his teeth chattered in his head,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3459",1751,"for there was a lake a mile long and a mile broad, lined within with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3460",1751,"white marble, and filled with water as clear as crystal, and he knew","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3463",1751,"That night he slept little or none, and when the seventh hour of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3465",1751,"Demon, and his hair bristled and his eyes shone like sparks of fire.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3466",1751,"""What hast thou for me to do?"" said he, and the poor Tailor could do","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3468",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3470",1751,"the Tailor found his wits and his tongue from sheer terror. ""Look!"" said","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3471",1751,"he, ""at the great mountain over yonder; remove it, and make in its place","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3475",1751,"""It shall be done,"" said the Demon, and, so saying, he stamped his heel","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3476",1751,"upon the ground. Instantly the earth began to tremble and quake, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3477",1751,"there came a great rumbling like the sound of thunder. A cloud of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3478",1751,"darkness gathered in the sky, until at last all was as black as the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3479",1751,"blackest midnight. Then came a roaring and a cracking and a crashing,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3480",1751,"such as man never heard before. All day it continued, until the time","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3481",1751,"of the setting of the sun, when suddenly the uproar ceased, and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3482",1751,"darkness cleared away; and when the Tailor looked out of the window","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3746",1751,"whenever she went out to take a ride a herald was sent through the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3763",1751,"through the door, and when the princess came riding by he peeped out at","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3768",1751,"sneezed. Her cheeks were like milk and rose-leaves, and her hair like","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3769",1751,"fine threads of gold. She sat in a golden coach with a golden crown","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3779",1751,"good luck. He pulled his piece of blue glass out of his pocket and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3780",1751,"breathed upon it and rubbed it with his thumb, and instantly the Genie","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3798",1751,"together, and instantly there appeared twenty musicians, dressed in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3799",1751,"cloth of gold and silver. With them they brought hautboys and fiddles,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3800",1751,"big and little, and flageolets and drums and horns, and this and that to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3801",1751,"make music with. Again the Genie smote his hands together, and instantly","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3802",1751,"there appeared fifty servants dressed in silks and satins and spangled","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3803",1751,"with jewels, who began to spread a table with fine linen embroidered","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3804",1751,"with gold, and to set plates of gold and silver upon it. The Genie smote","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3805",1751,"his hands together a third time, and in answer there came six servants.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3806",1751,"They led Jacob Stuck into another room, where there was a bath of musk","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3807",1751,"and rose-water. They bathed him in the bath and dressed him in clothes","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3808",1751,"like an emperor, and when he came out again his face shone, and he was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3809",1751,"as handsome as a picture.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3810",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3811",1751,"Then by-and-by he knew that the princess was coming, for suddenly there","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3812",1751,"was the sound of girls' voices singing and the twanging of stringed","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3813",1751,"instruments. The door flew open, and in came a crowd of beautiful girls,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3814",1751,"singing and playing music, and after them the princess herself, more","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3815",1751,"beautiful than ever. But the proud princess was frightened! Yes, she","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3816",1751,"was. And well she might be, for the Genie had flown with her through the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3817",1751,"air from the palace, and that is enough to frighten anybody. Jacob Stuck","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3818",1751,"came to her all glittering and shining with jewels and gold, and took","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3819",1751,"her by the hand. He led her up the hall, and as he did so the musicians","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3820",1751,"struck up and began playing the most beautiful music in the world. Then","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3821",1751,"Jacob Stuck and the princess sat down to supper and began eating and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3822",1751,"drinking, and Jacob Stuck talked of all the sweetest things he could","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3823",1751,"think of. Thousands of wax candles made the palace bright as day, and as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3824",1751,"the princess looked about her she thought she had never seen anything so","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3825",1751,"fine in all the world. After they had eaten their supper and ended with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3826",1751,"a dessert of all kinds of fruits and of sweetmeats, the door opened and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3827",1751,"there came a beautiful young serving-lad, carrying a silver tray, upon","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3828",1751,"which was something wrapped in a napkin. He kneeled before Jacob Stuck","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3829",1751,"and held the tray, and from the napkin Jacob Stuck took a necklace of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3830",1751,"diamonds, each stone as big as a pigeon's egg.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3831",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3837",1751,"Hardly had the last stroke sounded when every light was snuffed out, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3839",1751,"the Genie of Good Luck snatched the princess up once more and flew back","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3840",1751,"to the palace more swiftly than the wind. And, before the princess knew","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3842",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3847",1751,"The next morning there was a great buzzing in the palace, you may be","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3848",1751,"sure. The princess told all about how she had been carried away during","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3849",1751,"the night, and had supped in such a splendid palace, and with such","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3850",1751,"a handsome man dressed like an emperor. She showed her necklace of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3851",1751,"diamonds, and the king and his prime-minister could not look at it or","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3852",1751,"wonder at it enough. The prime-minister and the king talked and talked","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3853",1751,"the matter over together, and every now and then the proud princess put","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3854",1751,"in a word of her own.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3855",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3870",1751,"night to come. As soon as it had fallen, he breathed upon his piece of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3881",1751,"midnight. Then, again, the door opened, and the beautiful servant-lad","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3882",1751,"came with the tray and something upon it covered with a napkin. Jacob","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3883",1751,"Stuck unfolded the napkin, and this time it was a cup made of a single","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3936",1751,"just like it would drop from it.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3937",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3938",1751,"Then twelve o'clock sounded, the lights went out, and the Genie took the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3940",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3941",1751,"But the Genie had seen what the princess had done. As soon as he had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3942",1751,"taken her safe home, he struck his palms together and summoned all his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3943",1751,"companions. ""Go,"" said he, ""throughout the town and trim a lock of hair","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3944",1751,"from over the right ear of every man in the whole place;"" and so they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3945",1751,"did, from the king himself to the beggar-man at the gates. As for the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3946",1751,"prime-minister, the Genie himself trimmed two locks of hair from him,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3947",1751,"one from over each of his ears, so that the next morning he looked as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3948",1751,"shorn as an old sheep. In the morning all the town was in a hubbub, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3949",1751,"everybody was wondering how all the men came to have their hair clipped","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3950",1751,"as it was. But the princess had brought the lock of Jacob Stuck's hair","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3951",1751,"away with her wrapped up in a piece of paper, and there it was.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3953",1751,"As for the ring Jacob Stuck had given to her, why, the next morning","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3957",1751,"""I tell you,"" said the prime-minister, ""there is nothing in it but a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3977",1751,"So the herald was sent out around the town proclaiming that the princess","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3983",1751,"belonged would be made. All the men in the town crowded up to the king's","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3984",1751,"palace. But all for no use, for never a one of them was fitted with his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3986",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3987",1751,"As for Jacob Stuck, he too had heard what the herald had proclaimed.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3988",1751,"Yes; he too had heard it, and his heart jumped and hopped within him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3989",1751,"like a young lamb in the spring-time. He knew whose hair it was the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3990",1751,"princess had. Away he went by himself, and rubbed up his piece of blue","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4001",1751,"attendants who took Jacob Stuck, and led him into another room, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4002",1751,"began clothing him in a suit so magnificent that it dazzled the eyes to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4003",1751,"look at it. He smote his hands together again, and out in the court-yard","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4004",1751,"there appeared a troop of horsemen to escort Jacob Stuck to the palace,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4007",1751,"black as night and one as white as milk, and it twinkled and sparkled","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4017",1751,"gold-and-silver armor wheeled their horses, the trumpets blew, and away","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4018",1751,"they rode--such a sight as was never seen in that town before, when they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4019",1751,"had come out into the streets. The young men with the basins scattered","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4020",1751,"the gold money to the people, and a great crowd ran scrambling after,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4022",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4045",1751,"shall marry the princess."" For if he does that, thought the king to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4050",1751,"Well, all that day Jacob Stuck feasted and made merry at the king's","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4052",1751,"palace. But Jacob Stuck said nothing at all; he just feasted and drank","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4053",1751,"and made merry. When night had come, however, it was all different. Away","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4054",1751,"he went by himself, and blew his breath upon his piece of blue glass,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4059",1751,"carried away, and a palace built there of white marble and gold and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4060",1751,"silver, such as the world never saw before. And let there be gardens","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4061",1751,"planted there with flowering plants and trees, and let there be","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4071",1751,"calling and shouting. All that night the sounds continued unceasingly,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4072",1751,"but at daybreak all was still, and when the sun arose there stood the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4073",1751,"most splendid palace it ever looked down upon; shining as white as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4074",1751,"snow, and blazing with gold and silver. All around it were gardens and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4075",1751,"fountains and orchards. A great highway had been built between it and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4076",1751,"the king's palace, and all along the highway a carpet of cloth of gold","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4081",1751,"sand hills! The folk flocked in crowds to see it, and all the country","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4082",1751,"about was alive with people coming and going. As for the king, he could","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4083",1751,"not believe his eyes when he saw it. He stood with the princess and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4084",1751,"looked and looked. Then came Jacob Stuck. ""And now,"" said he, ""am I to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4094",1751,"with music, sent by the Genie to escort Jacob Stuck and the princess and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4095",1751,"the king and the prime-minister to Jacob Stuck's new palace. They rode","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4096",1751,"along over the carpet of gold, and such a fine sight was never seen","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4098",1751,"servants, clad in silks and satins and jewels, came out to meet them,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4099",1751,"singing and dancing and playing on harps and lutes. The king and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4392",1751,"towards evening, they came to a town with high towers and steep roofs","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4393",1751,"and tall spires. The servant's companion entered the gate as though","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4398",1751,"little pipe from under his jacket, began playing so sweetly upon it that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4426",1751,"feasting together the young man told them his story, and why it was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4427",1751,"he was so sad. A year before he had married a young lady, the most","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4428",1751,"beautiful in all that kingdom, and had friends and comrades and all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4429",1751,"things that a man could desire in the world. But suddenly everything","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4430",1751,"went wrong; his wife and he fell out and quarrelled until there was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4431",1751,"no living together, and she had to go back to her old home. Then his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4432",1751,"companions deserted him, and now he lived all alone.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4433",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4434",1751,"""Yours is a hard case,"" said the travelling companion, ""but it is not","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4435",1751,"past curing."" Thereupon he drew out his pipes and began to play, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4436",1751,"it was such a tune as no man ever listened to before. He played and he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4437",1751,"played, and, after a while, one after another of those who listened to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4438",1751,"him began to get drowsy. First they winked, then they shut their eyes,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4439",1751,"and then they nodded until all were as dumb as logs, and as sound asleep","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4440",1751,"as though they would never waken again. Only the servant and the piper","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4441",1751,"stayed awake, for the music did not make them drowsy as it did the rest.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4442",1751,"Then, when all but they two were tight and fast asleep, the travelling","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4443",1751,"companion arose, tucked away his pipe, and, stepping up to the young","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4450",1751,"As for the serving-man, though he remembered his promise and said","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4451",1751,"nothing concerning what he had beheld, his wits buzzed in his head like","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4452",1751,"a hive of bees, for he thought that of all the ugly tricks he had seen,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4453",1751,"none was more ugly than this--to bewitch the poor sorrowful young man","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4454",1751,"into a sleep, and then to rob him of his ruby ring after he had fed them","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4460",1751,"the poor serving-man's flesh quaked to hear the wild beasts and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4465",1751,"ahead until, by-and-by, they saw a light twinkling far away, and, when","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4466",1751,"they came to it, they found a gloomy stone house, as ugly as eyes ever","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4468",1751,"door--rap! tap! tap! By-and-by it was opened a crack, and there stood an","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4735",1751,"and a purse containing a hundred pieces of gold money. The day was very","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4760",1751,"Nevertheless, he was generous and open-hearted, and grudged his friend","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4770",1751,"same way that the other had flown. By-and-by Ali borrowed a third piece","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4771",1751,"of money, and then a fourth and then a fifth, so that by the time that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4772",1751,"six months had passed and gone he had spent thirty of the hundred pieces","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4795",1751,"your eyes! For twelve years have I lived with this young man as a father","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4796",1751,"might live with a son, and now how does he repay me? He has stolen all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4801",1751,"thinking him guilty, dragged him off to the judge, reviling him and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4802",1751,"heaping words of abuse upon him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4803",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4812",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4813",1751,"His question was one easily enough answered; a score of people were","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4814",1751,"there to testify that the elder of the two had been living well and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4815",1751,"spending money freely for six months and more, and a score were also","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4816",1751,"there to swear that Abdallah had lived all the while in penury. ""Then","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4817",1751,"that decides the matter,"" said the Wise Judge. ""The money belongs to the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4819",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4820",1751,"""But listen, oh my lord judge!"" cried Abdallah. ""All that this man has","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4821",1751,"spent I have given to him--I, who found the money. Yes, my lord, I have","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4827",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4828",1751,"So poor Abdallah was beaten with rods until he confessed where he had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4830",1751,"kept twenty himself for his decision, and all went their way praising","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4833",1751,"That is to say, all but poor Abdallah; he went to his home weeping and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4834",1751,"wailing, and with every one pointing the finger of scorn at him. He was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4835",1751,"just as poor as ever, and his back was sore with the beating that he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4836",1751,"had suffered. All that night he continued to weep and wail, and when the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4839",1751,"Now it chanced that a wise man passed that way, and hearing his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4840",1751,"lamentation, stopped to inquire the cause of his trouble. Abdallah told","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4841",1751,"the other of his sorrow, and the wise man listened, smiling, till he was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4842",1751,"done, and then he laughed outright. ""My son,"" said he, ""if every one in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4843",1751,"your case should shed tears as abundantly as you have done, the world","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4853",1751,"shaking with his merriment.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4854",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4855",1751,"""All this,"" said Ali Baba, ""is only the beginning of my story; and now","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4859",1751,"He watched Little Brown Betty until she had filled his mug, and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4860",1751,"froth ran over the top. Then he took a deep draught and began again.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4861",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4862",1751,"Though Abdallah had affirmed that he did not believe what the wise man","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4864",1751,"makes one feel easier in trouble to be told that others have been in a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4866",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4867",1751,"So, by-and-by, Abdallah plucked up some spirit, and, saddling his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4868",1751,"ass and shouldering his axe, started off to the woods for a bundle of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4869",1751,"fagots.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4870",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4871",1751,"Misfortunes, they say, never come single, and so it seemed to be with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4872",1751,"the fagot-maker that day; for that happened that had never happened to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4873",1751,"him before--he lost his way in the woods. On he went, deeper and deeper","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4874",1751,"into the thickets, driving his ass before him, bewailing himself and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4875",1751,"rapping his head with his knuckles. But all his sorrowing helped him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4876",1751,"nothing, and by the time that night fell he found himself deep in the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4877",1751,"midst of a great forest full of wild beasts, the very thought of which","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4878",1751,"curdled his blood. He had had nothing to eat all day long, and now","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4879",1751,"the only resting-place left him was the branches of some tree. So,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4880",1751,"unsaddling his ass and leaving it to shift for itself, he climbed to and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4881",1751,"roosted himself in the crotch of a great limb.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4882",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4883",1751,"In spite of his hunger he presently fell asleep, for trouble breeds","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4884",1751,"weariness as it breeds grief.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4885",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4886",1751,"About the dawning of the day he was awakened by the sound of voices and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4887",1751,"the glaring of lights. He craned his neck and looked down, and there he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4888",1751,"saw a sight that filled him with amazement: three old men riding each","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4889",1751,"upon a milk-white horse and each bearing a lighted torch in his hand, to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4890",1751,"light the way through the dark forest.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4891",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4892",1751,"When they had come just below where Abdallah sat, they dismounted and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4893",1751,"fastened their several horses to as many trees. Then he who rode first","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4894",1751,"of the three, and who wore a red cap and who seemed to be the chief of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4895",1751,"them, walked solemnly up to a great rock that stood in the hillside,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4896",1751,"and, breaking a switch from a shrub that grew in a cleft, struck the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4897",1751,"face of the stone, crying in a loud voice, ""I command thee to open, in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4898",1751,"the name of the red Aldebaran!""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4899",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4900",1751,"Instantly, creaking and groaning, the face of the rock opened like","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4901",1751,"a door, gaping blackly. Then, one after another, the three old men","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4902",1751,"entered, and nothing was left but the dull light of their torches,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4903",1751,"shining on the walls of the passage-way.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4904",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4905",1751,"What happened inside the cavern the fagot-maker could neither see nor","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4906",1751,"hear, but minute after minute passed while he sat as in a maze at all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4907",1751,"that had happened. Then presently he heard a deep thundering voice and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4908",1751,"a voice as of one of the old men in answer. Then there came a sound","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4909",1751,"swelling louder and louder, as though a great crowd of people were","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4910",1751,"gathering together, and with the voices came the noise of the neighing","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4911",1751,"of horses and the trampling of hoofs. Then at last there came pouring","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4912",1751,"from out the rock a great crowd of horses laden with bales and bundles","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4913",1751,"of rich stuffs and chests and caskets of gold and silver and jewels,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4914",1751,"and each horse was led by a slave clad in a dress of cloth-of-gold,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4915",1751,"sparkling and glistening with precious gems. When all these had come","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4916",1751,"out from the cavern, other horses followed, upon each of which sat","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4917",1751,"a beautiful damsel, more lovely than the fancy of man could picture.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4918",1751,"Beside the damsels marched a guard, each man clad in silver armor, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4919",1751,"each bearing a drawn sword that flashed in the brightening day more","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4920",1751,"keenly than the lightning. So they all came pouring forth from the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4921",1751,"cavern until it seemed as though the whole woods below were filled with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4922",1751,"the wealth and the beauty of King Solomon's day--and then, last of all,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4923",1751,"came the three old men.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4924",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4925",1751,"""In the name of the red Aldebaran,"" said he who had bidden the rock to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4926",1751,"open, ""I command thee to become closed."" Again, creaking and groaning,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4927",1751,"the rock shut as it had opened--like a door--and the three old men,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4928",1751,"mounting their horses, led the way from the woods, the others following.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4929",1751,"The noise and confusion of the many voices shouting and calling, the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4930",1751,"trample and stamp of horses, grew fainter and fainter, until at last","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4931",1751,"all was once more hushed and still, and only the fagot-maker was left","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4932",1751,"behind, still staring like one dumb and bereft of wits.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4933",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4934",1751,"But so soon as he was quite sure that all were really gone, he clambered","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4935",1751,"down as quickly as might be. He waited for a while to make doubly sure","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4936",1751,"that no one was left behind, and then he walked straight up to the rock,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4937",1751,"just as he had seen the old man do. He plucked a switch from the bush,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4938",1751,"just as he had seen the old man pluck one, and struck the stone, just","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4939",1751,"as the old man had struck it. ""I command thee to open,"" said he, ""in the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4941",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4942",1751,"Instantly, as it had done in answer to the old man's command, there came","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4943",1751,"a creaking and a groaning, and the rock slowly opened like a door, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4944",1751,"there was the passageway yawning before him. For a moment or two the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4945",1751,"fagot-maker hesitated to enter; but all was as still as death, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4946",1751,"finally he plucked up courage and went within.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4947",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4948",1751,"By this time the day was brightening and the sun rising, and by the gray","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4949",1751,"light the fagot-maker could see about him pretty clearly. Not a sign was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4950",1751,"to be seen of horses or of treasure or of people--nothing but a square","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4951",1751,"block of marble, and upon it a black casket, and upon that again a gold","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4952",1751,"ring, in which was set a blood-red stone. Beyond these things there was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4953",1751,"nothing; the walls were bare, the roof was bare, the floor was bare--all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4954",1751,"was bare and naked stone.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4955",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4956",1751,"""Well,"" said the wood-chopper, ""as the old men have taken everything","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4957",1751,"else, I might as well take these things. The ring is certainly worth","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4958",1751,"something, and maybe I shall be able to sell the casket for a trifle","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4959",1751,"into the bargain."" So he slipped the ring upon his finger, and, taking","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4960",1751,"up the casket, left the place. ""I command thee to be closed,"" said","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4961",1751,"he, ""in the name of the red Aldebaran!"" And thereupon the door closed,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4962",1751,"creaking and groaning.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4963",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4964",1751,"After a little while he found his ass, saddled it and bridled it, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4965",1751,"loaded it with the bundle of fagots that he had chopped the day before,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4966",1751,"and then set off again to try to find his way out of the thick woods.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4967",1751,"But still his luck was against him, and the farther he wandered the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4968",1751,"deeper he found himself in the thickets. In the meantime he was like to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4969",1751,"die of hunger, for he had not a bite to eat for more than a whole day.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4970",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4971",1751,"""Perhaps,"" said he to himself, ""there may be something in the casket to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4972",1751,"stay my stomach;"" and, so saying, he sat him down, unlocked the casket,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4977",1751,"scampered the jackass, kicking up his heels and braying so that the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4978",1751,"leaves of the trees trembled and shook. For no sooner had he lifted the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4979",1751,"lid than out leaped a great hideous Genie, as black as a coal, with one","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4980",1751,"fiery-red eye in the middle of his forehead that glared and rolled most","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4981",1751,"horribly, and with his hands and feet set with claws, sharp and hooked","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4982",1751,"like the talons of a hawk. Poor Abdallah the fagot-maker lay upon his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4985",1751,"""What are thy commands?"" said the Genie in a terrible voice, that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5006",1751,"Abdallah could do nothing but sit staring at the Genie, for the sight of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5284",1751,"permit him, but, raising him, kissed him upon the cheek, calling him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5292",1751,"rejoicing. The city was illuminated from end to end, and all of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6193",1751,"in cold weather, but many and many a time Selim the Fisherman's stomach","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6314",1751,"Then the boat landed, and there stood dozens of scores of great princes","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6315",1751,"and nobles to welcome Selim when he came ashore. And there was a white","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6316",1751,"horse waiting for him to ride, and its saddle and bridle were studded","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6317",1751,"with diamonds and rubies and emeralds that sparkled and glistened like","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6318",1751,"the stars in heaven, and Selim thought for sure he must be dreaming with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6323",1751,"the splendid palaces, the princes and noblemen riding with him, and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6325",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6326",1751,"And what a palace it was!--as white as snow and painted all inside","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6327",1751,"with gold and blue. All around it were gardens blooming with fruit and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6328",1751,"flowers, and the like of it mortal man never saw in the world before.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6329",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6330",1751,"There they made a king of Selim, and put a golden crown on his head; and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6331",1751,"that is what the Ring of Good Luck can do for a baker.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6332",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6333",1751,"But wait a bit! There was something queer about it all, and that is now","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6335",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6336",1751,"All that day was feasting and drinking and merry-making, and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6337",1751,"twinging and twanging of music, and dancing of beautiful dancing-girls,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6338",1751,"and such things as Selim had never heard tell of in all his life before.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6339",1751,"And when night came they lit thousands and thousands of candles of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6342",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6343",1751,"But at last it came midnight, and then suddenly, in an instant, all the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6344",1751,"lights went out and everything was as dark as pitch--not a spark, not","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6345",1751,"a glimmer anywhere. And, just as suddenly, all the sound of music and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6346",1751,"dancing and merrymaking ceased, and everybody began to wail and cry","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6347",1751,"until it was enough to wring one's heart to hear. Then, in the midst of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6348",1751,"all the wailing and crying, a door was flung open, and in came six tall","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6349",1751,"and terrible black men, dressed all in black from top to toe, carrying","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6350",1751,"each a flaming torch; and by the light of the torches King Selim saw","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6351",1751,"that all--the princes, the noblemen, the dancing-girls--all lay on their","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6352",1751,"faces on the floor.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6353",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6354",1751,"The six men took King Selim--who shuddered and shook with fear--by the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6355",1751,"arms, and marched him through dark, gloomy entries and passage-ways,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6356",1751,"until they came at last to the very heart of the palace.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6357",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6358",1751,"There was a great high-vaulted room all of black marble, and in the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6359",1751,"middle of it was a pedestal with seven steps, all of black marble; and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6360",1751,"on the pedestal stood a stone statue of a woman looking as natural as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6361",1751,"life, only that her eyes were shut. The statue was dressed like a queen:","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6362",1751,"she wore a golden crown on her head, and upon her body hung golden","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6363",1751,"robes, set with diamonds and emeralds and rubies and sapphires and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6364",1751,"pearls and all sorts of precious stones.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6365",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6366",1751,"As for the face of the statue, white paper and black ink could not tell","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6367",1751,"you how beautiful it was. When Selim looked at it, it made his heart","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6368",1751,"stand still in his breast, it was so beautiful.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6369",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6370",1751,"The six men brought Selim up in front of the statue, and then a voice","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6371",1751,"came as though from the vaulted roof: ""Selim! Selim! Selim!"" it said,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6372",1751,"""what are thou doing? To-day is feasting and drinking and merry-making,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6373",1751,"but beware of tomorrow!""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6374",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6375",1751,"As soon as these words were ended the six black men marched King Selim","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6376",1751,"back whence they had brought him; there they left him and passed out one","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6377",1751,"by one as they had first come in, and the door shut to behind them.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6378",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6379",1751,"Then in an instant the lights flashed out again, the music began to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6380",1751,"play and the people began to talk and laugh, and King Selim thought that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6381",1751,"maybe all that had just passed was only a bit of an ugly dream after","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6382",1751,"all.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6383",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6384",1751,"So that is the way King Selim the Baker began to reign, and that is the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6385",1751,"way he continued to reign. All day was feasting and drinking and making","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6386",1751,"merry and music and laughing and talking. But every night at midnight","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6387",1751,"the same thing happened: the lights went out, all the people began","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6388",1751,"wailing and crying, and the six tall, terrible black men came with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6389",1751,"flashing torches and marched King Selim away to the beautiful statue.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6390",1751,"And every night the same voice said--""Selim! Selim! Selim! What art thou","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6391",1751,"doing! To-day is feasting and drinking and merry-making; but beware of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6393",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6394",1751,"So things went on for a twelvemonth, and at last came the end of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6395",1751,"year. That day and night the merry-making was merrier and wilder and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6396",1751,"madder than it had ever been before, but the great clock in the tower","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6397",1751,"went on--tick, tock! tick, tock!--and by and by it came midnight. Then,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6398",1751,"as it always happened before, the lights went out, and all was as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6399",1751,"black as ink. But this time there was no wailing and crying out, but","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6400",1751,"everything was silent as death; the door opened slowly, and in came, not","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6401",1751,"six black men as before, but nine men as silent as death, dressed all in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6402",1751,"flaming red, and the torches they carried burned as red as blood. They","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6403",1751,"took King Selim by the arms, just as the six men had done, and marched","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6404",1751,"him through the same entries and passageways, and so came at last to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6405",1751,"the same vaulted room. There stood the statue, but now it was turned to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6406",1751,"flesh and blood, and the eyes were open and looking straight at Selim","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6407",1751,"the Baker.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6408",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6409",1751,"""Art thou Selim?"" said she; and she pointed her finger straight at him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6410",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6411",1751,"""Yes, I am Selim,"" said he.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6412",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6413",1751,"""And dost thou wear the gold ring with the red stone?"" said she.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6414",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6415",1751,"""Yes,"" said he; ""I have it on my finger.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6416",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6417",1751,"""And dost thou wear the iron ring?""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6418",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6419",1751,"""No,"" said he; ""I gave that to Selim the Fisherman.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6420",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6421",1751,"The words had hardly left his lips when the statue gave a great cry and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6422",1751,"clapped her hands together. In an instant an echoing cry sounded all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6423",1751,"over the town--a shriek fit to split the ears.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6424",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6425",1751,"The next moment there came another sound--a sound like thunder--above","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6426",1751,"and below and everywhere. The earth began to shake and to rock, and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6427",1751,"houses began to topple and fall, and the people began to scream and to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6428",1751,"yell and to shout, and the waters of the sea began to lash and to roar,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6429",1751,"and the wind began to bellow and howl. Then it was a good thing for King","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6430",1751,"Selim that he wore Luck's Ring; for, though all the beautiful snow-white","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6431",1751,"palace about him and above him began to crumble to pieces like slaked","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6432",1751,"lime, the sticks and the stones and the beams to fall this side of him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6433",1751,"and that, he crawled out from under it without a scratch or a bruise,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6434",1751,"like a rat out of a cellar.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6435",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6436",1751,"That is what Luck's Ring did for him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6437",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6438",1751,"But his troubles were not over yet; for, just as he came out from under","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6439",1751,"all the ruin, the island began to sink down into the water, carrying","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6440",1751,"everything along with it--that is, everything but him and one thing","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6441",1751,"else. That one other thing was an empty boat, and King Selim climbed","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6442",1751,"into it, and nothing else saved him from drowning. It was Luck's Ring","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6443",1751,"that did that for him also.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6444",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6445",1751,"The boat floated on and on until it came to another island that was just","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6446",1751,"like the island he had left, only that there was neither tree nor blade","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6447",1751,"of grass nor hide nor hair nor living thing of any kind. Nevertheless,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6448",1751,"it was an island just like the other: a high mountain and nothing else.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6449",1751,"There Selim the Baker went ashore, and there he would have starved to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6450",1751,"death only for Luck's Ring; for one day a boat came sailing by, and when","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6451",1751,"poor Selim shouted, those aboard heard him and came and took him off.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6452",1751,"How they all stared to see his golden crown--for he still wore it--and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6453",1751,"his robes of silk and satin and the gold and jewels!","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6454",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6455",1751,"Before they would consent to carry him away, they made him give up all","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6456",1751,"the fine things he had. Then they took him home again to the town whence","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6457",1751,"he had first come, just as poor as when he had started. Back he went to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6458",1751,"his bake-shop and his ovens, and the first thing he did was to take off","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6459",1751,"his gold ring and put it on the shelf.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6460",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6461",1751,"""If that is the ring of good luck,"" said he, ""I do not want to wear the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6463",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6464",1751,"That is the way with mortal man: for one has to have the Ring of Wisdom","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6466",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6467",1751,"And now for Selim the Fisherman.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6468",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6469",1751,"Well, thus it happened to him. For a while he carried the iron ring","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6470",1751,"around in his pocket--just as so many of us do--without thinking to put","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6471",1751,"it on. But one day he slipped it on his finger--and that is what we do","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6472",1751,"not all of us do. After that he never took it off again, and the world","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6473",1751,"went smoothly with him. He was not rich, but then he was not poor; he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6474",1751,"was not merry, neither was he sad. He always had enough and was thankful","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6475",1751,"for it, for I never yet knew wisdom to go begging or crying.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6476",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6477",1751,"So he went his way and he fished his fish, and twelve months and a week","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6478",1751,"or more passed by. Then one day he went past the baker shop and there","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6479",1751,"sat Selim the Baker smoking his pipe of tobacco.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6480",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6481",1751,"""So, friend,"" said Selim the Fisherman, ""you are back again in the old","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6482",1751,"place, I see.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6483",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6484",1751,"""Yes,"" said the other Selim; ""awhile ago I was a king, and now I","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6485",1751,"am nothing but a baker again. As for that gold ring with the red","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6486",1751,"stone--they may say it is Luck's Ring if they choose, but when next I","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6487",1751,"wear it may I be hanged.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6488",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6489",1751,"Thereupon he told Selim the Fisherman the story of what had happened to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6490",1751,"him with all its ins and outs, just as I have told it to you.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6491",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6492",1751,"""Well!"" said Selim the Fisherman, ""I should like to have a sight of that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6493",1751,"island myself. If you want the ring no longer, just let me have it; for","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6494",1751,"maybe if I wear it something of the kind will happen to me.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6495",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6496",1751,"""You may have it,"" said Selim the Baker. ""Yonder it is, and you are","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6497",1751,"welcome to it.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6498",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6499",1751,"So Selim the Fisherman put on the ring, and then went his way about his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6502",1751,"That night, as he came home carrying his nets over his shoulder, whom","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6505",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6506",1751,"""Is your name Selim?"" said the little man, just as he had done to Selim","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6511",1751,"""And do you wear a gold ring with a red stone?"" said the little old man,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6512",1751,"just as he had said before.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6513",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6518",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6519",1751,"Selim the Fisherman remembered all that Selim the Baker had told him,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6520",1751,"and he took no two thoughts as to what to do. Down he tumbled his nets,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6521",1751,"and away he went after the other as fast as his legs could carry him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6522",1751,"Here they went and there they went, up crooked streets and lanes and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6524",1751,"to which Selim the Baker had been brought. Then the old man knocked at","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6540",1751,"as white and beautiful, and the gardens and orchards just as fresh and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6541",1751,"blooming as though they had not all tumbled down and sunk under the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6542",1751,"water a week before, almost carrying poor Selim the Baker with them.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6543",1751,"There were the people dressed in silks and satins and jewels, just as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6546",1751,"There were the princes and the nobles and the white horse, and Selim the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6547",1751,"Fisherman got on his back and rode up to a dazzling snow-white palace,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6548",1751,"and they put a crown on his head and made a king of him, just as they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6553",1751,"moaning and a crying enough to make the heart curdle. Then the door","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6554",1751,"flew open, and in came the six terrible black men with torches. They","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6555",1751,"led Selim the Fisherman through damp and dismal entries and passage-ways","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6556",1751,"until they came to the vaulted room of black marble, and there stood","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6558",1751,"above--""Selim! Selim! Selim!"" it cried, ""what art thou doing? To-day is","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6577",1751,"there orchards and gardens, just like the palaces and the orchards and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6578",1751,"the gardens about him--only a great deal finer. Then he sent fleets and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6579",1751,"fleets of ships, and carried everything away from the island where he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6580",1751,"lived to that other island--all the men and the women and the children;","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6681",1751,"even the rich and the wise man must die, as well as the poor and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6709",1751,"Sometimes people gave him a penny or two, but it was little or nothing","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6719",1751,"either of good or bad. At last they came to a gate that led through a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6720",1751,"high wall and into a garden, and there the three stopped, and one of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6721",1751,"them knocked upon the gate. In answer to his knocking it flew open. He","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6722",1751,"thrust the beggar into the garden neck and crop, and then the gate was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6725",1751,"But what a sight it was the beggar saw before his eyes!--flowers, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6726",1751,"fruit-trees, and marble walks, and a great fountain that shot up a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6727",1751,"jet of water as white as snow. But he had not long to stand gaping and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6728",1751,"staring around him, for in the garden were a great number of people,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6729",1751,"who came hurrying to him, and who, without speaking a word to him or","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6730",1751,"answering a single question, or as much as giving him time to think,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6731",1751,"led him to a marble bath of tepid water. There he was stripped of his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6732",1751,"tattered clothes and washed as clean as snow. Then, as some of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6734",1751,"clothes fit for a prince to wear, and clad the beggar in them from head","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6738",1751,"fit for an emperor to ride. These helped him to mount, and then, leaping","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6743",1751,"and noblemen and great lords were waiting for their coming, some of whom","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6744",1751,"helped him to dismount from the horse, for by this time the beggar was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6745",1751,"so overcome with wonder that he stared like one moon-struck, and as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6746",1751,"though his wits were addled. Then, leading the way up the palace steps,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6747",1751,"they conducted him from room to room, until at last they came to one","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6748",1751,"more grand and splendid than all the rest, and there sat the king","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6750",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6751",1751,"The beggar would have flung himself at the king's feet, but the king","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6752",1751,"would not let him; for he came down from the throne where he sat, and,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6753",1751,"taking the beggar by the hand, led him up and sat him alongside of him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6754",1751,"Then the king gave orders to the attendants who stood about, and a feast","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6755",1751,"was served in plates of solid gold upon a table-cloth of silver--a feast","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6756",1751,"such as the beggar had never dreamed of, and the poor man ate as he had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6757",1751,"never eaten in his life before.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6759",1751,"All the while that the king and the beggar were eating, musicians played","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6764",1751,"beggar drank as he had never drank in his life before, and until his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6767",1751,"So the king and the beggar feasted and made merry, until at last the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6768",1751,"clock struck twelve and the king arose from his seat. ""My friend,"" said","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6769",1751,"he to the beggar, ""all these things have been done to show you that Luck","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6771",1751,"you. Hereafter, instead of being poor you shall be the richest of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6772",1751,"the rich, for I will give you the greatest thing that I have in my","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6773",1751,"treasury,"" Then he called the chief treasurer, who came forward with a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6775",1751,"the king, ""here is a purse, and in the purse are one hundred pieces of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6776",1751,"gold money. But though that much may seem great to you, it is but little","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6777",1751,"of the true value of the purse. Its virtue lies in this: that however","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6779",1751,"gold money left in it. Now go; and while you are enjoying the riches","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6780",1751,"which I give you, I have only to ask you to remember these are not the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6784",1751,"spinning, and buzzing and buzzing, so that he hardly heard a word of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6785",1751,"what the king said.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6786",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6787",1751,"Then when the king had ended his speech, the lords and gentlemen who had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6788",1751,"brought the beggar in led him forth again. Out they went through room","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6791",1751,"Bang!--it was shut to behind him, and he found himself standing in the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6795",1751,"He stood looking about himself for a while, and then off he started","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6796",1751,"homeward, staggering and stumbling and shuffling, for the wine that he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6797",1751,"had drank made him so light-headed that all the world spun topsy-turvy","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6799",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6800",1751,"His way led along by the river, and on he went stumbling and staggering.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6802",1751,"Up he came, spitting out the water and shouting for help, splashing and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6803",1751,"sputtering, and kicking and swimming, knowing no more where he was than","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6804",1751,"the man in the moon. Sometimes his head was under water and sometimes it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6805",1751,"was up again.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6807",1751,"At last, just as his strength was failing him, his feet struck the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6809",1751,"through fear and cold and wet, he swooned away, and lay for a long time","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6810",1751,"for all the world as though he were dead.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6811",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6812",1751,"Now, it chanced that two fisherman were out with their nets that night,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6813",1751,"and Luck or Fate led them by the way where the beggar lay on the shore.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6814",1751,"""Halloa!"" said one of the fishermen, ""here is a poor body drowned!"" They","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6815",1751,"turned him over, and then they saw what rich clothes he wore, and felt","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6817",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6818",1751,"""Come,"" said the second fisherman, ""he is dead, whoever he is. His fine","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6820",1751,"well have them as anybody else."" So between them both they stripped the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6821",1751,"beggar of all that the king had given him, and left him lying on the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6824",1751,"At daybreak the beggar awoke from the swoon, and there he found himself","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6825",1751,"lying without a stitch to his back, and half dead with the cold and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6826",1751,"water he had swallowed. Then, fearing lest somebody might see him, he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6827",1751,"crawled away into the rushes that grew beside the river, there to hide","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6828",1751,"himself until night should come again.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6829",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6830",1751,"But as he went, crawling upon hands and knees, he suddenly came upon a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6832",1751,"it his heart leaped within him, for what should that bundle be but the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6833",1751,"patches and tatters which he had worn the day before, and which the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6834",1751,"attendants had thrown over the garden wall and into the river when they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6835",1751,"had dressed him in the fine clothes the king gave him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6836",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6837",1751,"He spread his clothes out in the sun until they were dry, and then he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6839",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6840",1751,"""Well,"" said the king, that morning, to his chief councillor, ""what do","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6842",1751,"rich? And shall I not paint my father's words out from the wall, and put","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6844",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6845",1751,"""I do not know,"" said the councillor, shaking his head. ""Let us first","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6847",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6848",1751,"""So be it,"" said the king; and he and the councillor set off to see","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6849",1751,"whether the beggar had done as he ought to do with the good things that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6850",1751,"the king had given him. So they came to the towngate, and there, lo and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6851",1751,"behold! the first thing that they saw was the beggar with his wooden","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6852",1751,"bowl in his hand asking those who passed by for a stray penny or two.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6853",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6854",1751,"When the king saw him he turned without a word, and rode back home","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6855",1751,"again. ""Very well,"" said he to the chief councillor, ""I have tried to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6856",1751,"make the beggar rich and have failed; nevertheless, if I cannot make him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6857",1751,"I can ruin him in spite of Fate, and that I will show you.""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6858",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6859",1751,"So all that while the beggar sat at the towngate and begged until came","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6860",1751,"noontide, when who should he see coming but the same three men who had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6861",1751,"come for him the day before. ""Ah, ha!"" said he to himself, ""now the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6862",1751,"king is going to give me some more good things."" And so when the three","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6863",1751,"reached him he was willing enough to go with them, rough as they were.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6864",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6865",1751,"Off they marched; but this time they did not come to any garden with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6866",1751,"fruits and flowers and fountains and marble baths. Off they marched,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6867",1751,"and when they stopped it was in front of the king's palace. This time","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6868",1751,"no nobles and great lords and courtiers were waiting for his coming;","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6869",1751,"but instead of that the town hangman--a great ugly fellow, clad in black","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6870",1751,"from head to foot. Up he came to the beggar, and, catching him by the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6871",1751,"scruff of his neck, dragged him up the palace steps and from room to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6872",1751,"room until at last he flung him down at the king's feet.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6873",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6874",1751,"When the poor beggar gathered wits enough to look about him he saw there","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6875",1751,"a great chest standing wide open, and with holes in the lid. He wondered","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6876",1751,"what it was for, but the king gave him no chance to ask; for, beckoning","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6877",1751,"with his hand, the hangman and the others caught the beggar by arms and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6878",1751,"legs, thrust him into the chest, and banged down the lid upon him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6879",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6880",1751,"The king locked it and double-locked it, and set his seal upon it; and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6881",1751,"there was the beggar as tight as a fly in a bottle.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6882",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6883",1751,"They carried the chest out and thrust it into a cart and hauled it away,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6884",1751,"until at last they came to the sea-shore. There they flung chest and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6885",1751,"all into the water, and it floated away like a cork. And that is how the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6886",1751,"king set about to ruin the poor beggar-man.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6887",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6888",1751,"Well, the chest floated on and on for three days, and then at last it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6889",1751,"came to the shore of a country far away. There the waves caught it up,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6890",1751,"and flung it so hard upon the rocks of the sea-beach that the chest was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6891",1751,"burst open by the blow, and the beggar crawled out with eyes as big as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6892",1751,"saucers and face as white as dough. After he had sat for a while, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6893",1751,"when his wits came back to him and he had gathered strength enough, he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6894",1751,"stood up and looked around to see where Fate had cast him; and far away","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6895",1751,"on the hill-sides he saw the walls and the roofs and the towers of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6896",1751,"great town, shining in the sunlight as white as snow.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6897",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6898",1751,"""Well,"" said he, ""here is something to be thankful for, at least,"" and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6899",1751,"so saying and shaking the stiffness out of his knees and elbows, he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6900",1751,"started off for the white walls and the red roofs in the distance.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6901",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6902",1751,"At last he reached the great gate, and through it he could see the stony","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6904",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6924",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6925",1751,"So off he marched without another word. On and on he went along the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6927",1751,"Over the gate were written these words, in great letters as red as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6934",1751,"gone away again. But the beggar neither turned nor went away; because","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6935",1751,"why, he could neither read nor write a word, and so the blood-red","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6936",1751,"letters had no fear for him. Up he marched to the brazen gate, as boldly","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6937",1751,"as though it had been a kitchen door, and rap! tap! tap! he knocked upon","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7186",1751,"man's eye ever beheld, all made of mother-of-pearl and silver-frosted as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7187",1751,"white as snow. The old magician lifted the little palace out of the box","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7192",1751,"stood in the moonlight gleaming and glistening like snow, the windows","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7193",1751,"bright with the lights of a thousand wax tapers, and the sound of music","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7195",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7196",1751,"Hardly could the fisherman catch his breath from one strange thing","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7198",1751,"face--yes, his face--for all the world as though it had been a mask, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7200",1751,"on. Then, beckoning to the fisherman, dumb with wonder, he led the way","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7201",1751,"up the great flight of marble steps to the palace door. As he came","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7202",1751,"the door swung open with a blaze of light, and there stood hundreds of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7203",1751,"noblemen, all clad in silks and satins and velvets, who, when they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7211",1751,"cheeks like rose leaves, and her hair like spun gold. She came half-way","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7212",1751,"down the steps of the throne to welcome the magician, and when the two","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7213",1751,"met they kissed one another before all those who were looking on. Then","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7221",1751,"insides, and he longed for something good and warm to fill the empty","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7222",1751,"place. But time passed, and not so much as a crust of bread was brought","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7227",1751,"turning to those who stood around, said, in a loud voice, ""Behold him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7235",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7236",1751,"Then for the first time the beautiful lady seemed to notice the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7238",1751,"carrying a chest. The chief treasurer opened it, and it was full of bags","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7239",1751,"of gold money. ""How will you have it?"" said the beautiful lady.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7240",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7247",1751,"""So be it,"" said the beautiful lady. She waved her hand, and the chief","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7248",1751,"treasurer took a bag from the chest, untied it, and emptied a cataract","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7249",1751,"of gold into the fur cap. The fisherman had never seen so much wealth in","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7250",1751,"all his life before, and he stood like a man turned to stone.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7275",1751,"his sticks of spice-wood and his gray powder, and made a great fire and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7290",1751,"of his net and cap, to push up the handkerchief from over one eye. Out","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7394",1751,"richest in all of the world. All that day he wandered up and down, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7395",1751,"thought nothing of weariness and hunger for wonder of all that he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7396",1751,"saw. But at last evening drew down, and he began to bethink himself of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7401",1751,"richly but soberly, and every now and then he sighed and groaned, and as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7402",1751,"the prince drew near he saw the tears falling--drip, drip--from the old","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7426",1751,"another quarter of the town where he dwelt. He bade the servants prepare","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7427",1751,"a fine supper, and he and the prince sat down to the table together.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7428",1751,"After they had made an end of eating and drinking, the old man told the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7487",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7492",1751,"As soon as they had brought him thither they led the prince to a room","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7493",1751,"where was a golden table spread with a snow-white cloth and set with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7494",1751,"dishes of gold. At the end of the table the queen sat waiting for him,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7495",1751,"and her face was hidden by a veil of silver gauze. She raised the veil","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7496",1751,"and looked at the prince, and when he saw her face he stood as one","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7497",1751,"wonder-struck, for not only was she so beautiful, but she set a spell","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7498",1751,"upon him with the evil charm of her eyes. No one sat at the table but","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7499",1751,"the queen and the prince, and a score of young pages served them, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7500",1751,"sweet music sounded from a curtained gallery.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7501",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7502",1751,"At last came midnight, and suddenly a great gong sounded from the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7503",1751,"court-yard outside. Then in an instant the music was stopped, the pages","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7504",1751,"that served them hurried from the room, and presently all was as still","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7505",1751,"as death.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7506",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7507",1751,"Then, when all were gone, the queen arose and beckoned the prince, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7508",1751,"he had no choice but to arise also and follow whither she led. She took","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7509",1751,"him through the palace, where all was as still as the grave, and so came","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7510",1751,"out by a postern door into a garden. Beside the postern a torch burned","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7511",1751,"in a bracket. The queen took it down, and then led the prince up a path","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7512",1751,"and under the silent trees until they came to a great wall of rough","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7513",1751,"stone. She pressed her hand upon one of the great stones, and it opened","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7514",1751,"like a door, and there was a flight of steps that led downward. The","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7515",1751,"queen descended these steps, and the prince followed closely behind her.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7516",1751,"At the bottom was a long passage-way, and at the farther end the prince","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7517",1751,"saw what looked like a bright spark of light, as though the sun were","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7518",1751,"shining. She thrust the torch into another bracket in the wall of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7519",1751,"passage, and then led the way towards the light. It grew larger and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7520",1751,"larger as they went forward, until at last they came out at the farther","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7521",1751,"end, and there the prince found himself standing in the sunlight and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7522",1751,"not far from the seashore. The queen led the way towards the shore, when","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7523",1751,"suddenly a great number of black dogs came running towards them, barking","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7524",1751,"and snapping, and showing their teeth as though they would tear the two","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7525",1751,"in pieces. But the queen drew from her bosom a whip with a steel-pointed","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7526",1751,"lash, and as the dogs came springing towards them she laid about her","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7527",1751,"right and left, till the skin flew and the blood ran, and the dogs","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7528",1751,"leaped away howling and yelping.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7529",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7530",1751,"At the edge of the water was a great stone mill, and the queen pointed","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7531",1751,"towards it and bade the prince turn it. Strong as he was, it was as much","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7532",1751,"as he could do to work it; but grind it he did, though the sweat ran","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7533",1751,"down his face in streams. By-and-by a speck appeared far away upon the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7534",1751,"water; and as the prince ground and ground at the mill the speck grew","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7535",1751,"larger and larger. It was something upon the water, and it came nearer","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7536",1751,"and nearer as swiftly as the wind. At last it came close enough for him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7537",1751,"to see that it was a little boat all of brass. By-and-by the boat struck","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7538",1751,"upon the beach, and as soon as it did so the queen entered it, bidding","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7539",1751,"the prince do the same.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7540",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7541",1751,"No sooner were they seated than away the boat went, still as swiftly as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7542",1751,"the wind. On it flew and on it flew, until at last they came to another","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7543",1751,"shore, the like of which the prince had never seen in his life before.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7544",1751,"Down to the edge of the water ran a garden--but such a garden! The","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7545",1751,"leaves of the trees were all of silver and the fruit of gold, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7546",1751,"instead of flowers were precious stones--white, red, yellow, blue, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7547",1751,"green--that flashed like sparks of sunlight as the breeze moved them","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7548",1751,"this way and that way. Beyond the silver trees, with their golden fruit,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7549",1751,"was a great palace as white as snow, and so bright that one had to shut","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7550",1751,"one's eyes as one looked upon it.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7551",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7552",1751,"The boat ran up on the beach close to just such a stone mill as the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7553",1751,"prince had seen upon the other side of the water, and then he and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7554",1751,"the queen stepped ashore. As soon as they had done so the brazen boat","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7555",1751,"floated swiftly away, and in a little while was gone.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7556",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7557",1751,"""Here our journey ends,"" said the queen. ""Is it not a wonderful land,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7558",1751,"and well worth the seeing? Look at all these jewels and this gold, as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7559",1751,"plenty as fruits and flowers at home. You may take what you please; but","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7560",1751,"while you are gathering them I have another matter after which I must","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7562",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7563",1751,"So saying, she turned and left the prince, going towards the castle back","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7564",1751,"of the trees.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7565",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7566",1751,"But the prince was a prince, and not a common man; he cared nothing for","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7567",1751,"gold and jewels. What he did care for was to see where the queen went,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7568",1751,"and why she had brought him to this strange land. So, as soon as she had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7569",1751,"fairly gone, he followed after.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7570",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7571",1751,"He went along under the gold and silver trees, in the direction she had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7572",1751,"taken, until at last he came to a tall flight of steps that led up to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7573",1751,"the doorway of the snow-white palace. The door stood open, and into it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7574",1751,"the prince went. He saw not a soul, but he heard a noise as of blows and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7575",1751,"the sound as of some one weeping. He followed the sound, until by-and-by","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7576",1751,"he came to a great vaulted room in the very centre of the palace. A","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7577",1751,"curtain hung at the doorway. The prince lifted it and peeped within, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7578",1751,"this was what he saw:","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7579",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7580",1751,"In the middle of the room was a marble basin of water as clear as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7582",1751,"letters of gold:","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7583",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7586",1751,"Beside the fountain upon a marble stand stood a statue of a beautiful","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7587",1751,"woman made of alabaster, and around the neck of the statue was a thread","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7588",1751,"of gold. The queen stood beside the statue, and beat and beat it with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7589",1751,"her steel-tipped whip. And all the while she lashed it the statue sighed","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7590",1751,"and groaned like a living being, and the tears ran down its stone cheeks","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7591",1751,"as though it were a suffering Christian. By-and-by the queen rested for","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7592",1751,"a moment, and said, panting, ""Will you give me the thread of gold?"" and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7593",1751,"the statue answered ""No."" Whereupon she fell to raining blows upon it as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7598",1751,"""No,"" and all the while the prince stood gazing and wondering. By-and-by","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7605",1751,"grind at the great stone mill as he had done on the other side of the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7606",1751,"water. Thereupon the prince did as she bade, and presently the brazen","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7607",1751,"boat came skimming over the water more swiftly than the wind. Again the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7608",1751,"queen and the prince entered it, and again it carried them to the other","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7609",1751,"side whence they had come.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7610",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7611",1751,"No sooner had the queen set foot upon the shore than she stopped and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7612",1751,"gathered up a handful of sand. Then, turning as quick as lightning, she","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7613",1751,"flung it into the prince's face. ""Be a black dog,"" she cried in a loud","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7614",1751,"voice, ""and join your comrades!""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7615",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7616",1751,"And now it was that the ring that the prince's mother had given him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7617",1751,"stood him in good stead. But for it he would have become a black dog","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7618",1751,"like those others, for thus it had happened to all before him who had","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7619",1751,"ferried the witch queen over the water. So she expected to see him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7620",1751,"run away yelping, as those others had done; but the prince remained a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7621",1751,"prince, and stood looking her in the face.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7622",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7623",1751,"When the queen saw that her magic had failed her she grew as pale as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7624",1751,"death, and fell to trembling in every limb. She turned and hastened","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7625",1751,"quickly away, and the prince followed her wondering, for he neither knew","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7626",1751,"the mischief she had intended doing him, nor how his ring had saved him","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7627",1751,"from the fate of those others.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7628",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7629",1751,"So they came back up the stairs and out through the stone wall into","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7630",1751,"the palace garden. The queen pressed her hand against the stone and it","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7631",1751,"turned back into its place again. Then, beckoning to the prince, she","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7632",1751,"hurried away down the garden. Before he followed he picked up a coal","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7633",1751,"that lay near by, and put a cross upon the stone; then he hurried after","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7634",1751,"her, and so came to the palace once more.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7635",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7636",1751,"By this time the cocks were crowing, and the dawn of day was just","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7638",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7639",1751,"As for the queen, she had regained her composure, and, bidding the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7640",1751,"prince wait for her a moment, she hastened to her chamber. There she","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7641",1751,"opened her book of magic, and in it she soon found who the prince was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7642",1751,"and how the ring had saved him.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7643",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7644",1751,"When she had learned all that she wanted to know she put on a smiling","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7662",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7663",1751,"Alas for him! He thought no evil, but, without a word, drew off the ring","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7665",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7666",1751,"""O fool!"" she cried, laughing a wicked laugh, ""O fool! to give away that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7667",1751,"in which your safety lay!"" As she spoke she dipped her fingers into a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7671",1751,"In an instant the prince was a prince no longer, but a coal-black raven.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7672",1751,"The queen snatched up a sword that lay near by and struck at him to kill","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7674",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7675",1751,"By good luck a window stood open, and before the queen could strike","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7677",1751,"house-tops and was gone.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7678",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7680",1751,"to the room where his foster-father himself was sitting. He lit upon the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7681",1751,"ground at the old man's feet and tried to tell him what had befallen,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7682",1751,"but all that he could say was ""Croak! croak!""","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7683",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7684",1751,"""What brings this bird of ill omen?"" said the old man, and he drew his","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7685",1751,"sword to kill it. He raised his hand to strike, but the raven did not","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7686",1751,"try to fly away as he had expected, but bowed his neck to receive the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7687",1751,"stroke. Then the old man saw that the tears were running down from the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7688",1751,"raven's eyes, and he held his hand. ""What strange thing is this?"" he","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7689",1751,"said. ""Surely nothing but the living soul weeps; and how, then, can this","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7694",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7695",1751,"The raven answered ""Croak!"" and nothing else; but the good old man","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7697",1751,"his beard. ""Whether man or raven, you shall still be my son,"" said he,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7698",1751,"and he held the raven close in his arms and caressed it.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7699",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7700",1751,"He had a golden cage made for the bird, and every day he would walk with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7702",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7703",1751,"One day when they were thus in the garden together a strange lady came","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7704",1751,"towards them down the pathway. Over her had and face was drawn a thick","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7705",1751,"veil, so that the two could not tell who she was. When she came close to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7706",1751,"them she raised the veil, and the raven-prince saw that her face was the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7707",1751,"living likeness of the queen's; and yet there was something in it that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7708",1751,"was different. It was the second sister of the queen, and the old man","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7709",1751,"knew her and bowed before her.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7710",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7711",1751,"""Listen,"" said she. ""I know what the raven is, and that it is the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7712",1751,"prince, whom the queen has bewitched. I also know nearly as much of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7713",1751,"magic as she, and it is that alone that has saved me so long from ill.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7714",1751,"But danger hangs close over me; the queen only waits for the chance to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7715",1751,"bewitch me; and some day she will overpower me, for she is stronger","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7716",1751,"than I. With the prince's aid I can overcome her and make myself forever","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7717",1751,"safe, and it is this that has brought me here to-day. My magic is","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7718",1751,"powerful enough to change the prince back into his true shape again, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7719",1751,"I will do so if he will aid me in what follows, and this is it: I will","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7720",1751,"conjure the queen, and by-and-by a great eagle will come flying, and its","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7721",1751,"plumage will be as black as night. Then I myself will become an eagle,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7722",1751,"with black-and-white plumage, and we two will fight in the air. After a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7723",1751,"while we will both fall to the ground, and then the prince must cut off","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7724",1751,"the head of the black eagle with a knife I shall give him. Will you do","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7725",1751,"this?"" said she, turning to the raven, ""if I transform you to your true","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7727",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7728",1751,"The raven bowed his head and said ""Croak!"" And the sister of the queen","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7729",1751,"knew that he meant yes.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7730",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7731",1751,"Therewith she drew a great, long keen knife from her bosom, and thrust","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7732",1751,"it into the ground. ""It is with this knife of magic,"" said she, ""that","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7733",1751,"you must cut off the black eagle's head."" Then the witch-princess","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7734",1751,"gathered up some sand in her hand, and flung it into the raven's face.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7735",1751,"""Resume,"" cried she, ""your own shape!"" And in an instant the prince was","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7736",1751,"himself again. The next thing the sister of the queen did was to draw a","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7737",1751,"circle upon the ground around the prince, the old man, and herself. On","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7738",1751,"the circle she marked strange figures here and there. Then, all three","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7739",1751,"standing close together, she began her conjurations, uttering strange","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7740",1751,"words--now under her breath, and now clear and loud.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7741",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7742",1751,"Presently the sky darkened, and it began to thunder and rumble. Darker","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7743",1751,"it grew and darker, and the thunder crashed and roared. The earth","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7744",1751,"trembled under their feet, and the trees swayed hither and thither as","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7745",1751,"though tossed by a tempest. Then suddenly the uproar ceased and all grew","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7746",1751,"as still as death, the clouds rolled away, and in a moment the sun shone","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7747",1751,"out once more, and all was calm and serene as it had been before. But","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7748",1751,"still the princess muttered her conjurations, and as the prince and the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7749",1751,"old man looked they beheld a speck that grew larger and larger, until","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7750",1751,"they saw that it was an eagle as black as night that was coming swiftly","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7751",1751,"flying through the sky. Then the queen's sister also saw it and ceased","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7752",1751,"from her spells. She drew a little cap of feathers from her bosom with","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7753",1751,"trembling hands. ""Remember,"" said she to the prince; and, so saying,","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7754",1751,"clapped the feather cap upon her head. In an instant she herself became","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7755",1751,"an eagle--pied, black and white--and, spreading her wings, leaped into","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7756",1751,"the air.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7757",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7758",1751,"For a while the two eagles circled around and around; but at last they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7759",1751,"dashed against one another, and, grappling with their talons, tumbled","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7760",1751,"over and over until they struck the ground close to the two who stood","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7761",1751,"looking.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7762",1751,"","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7763",1751,"Then the prince snatched the knife from the ground and ran to where they","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7769",1751,"The prince needed no second telling to see the wisdom of what the old","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7770",1751,"man said. In an instant he struck off the heads of both the eagles, and","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7771",1751,"thus put an end to both sorceresses, the lesser as well as the greater.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7772",1751,"They buried both of the eagles in the garden without telling any one of","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7773",1751,"what had happened. So soon as that was done the old man bade the prince","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7774",1751,"tell him all that had befallen him, and the prince did so.","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7786",1751,"through the passageway, until they came out upon the sea-shore. The","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7787",1751,"black dogs came leaping towards them; but this time it was to fawn upon","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7792",1751,"the other side. They did not tarry in the garden, but went straight to","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7793",1751,"the snow-white palace and to the great vaulted chamber where was the","Twilight Land","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
