"4545",1837,"formless drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"

"4547",1837,"light--always far away, apparently--almost in another world; if he heard","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4548",1837,"the tinkle of a sheep's bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct;","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4549",1837,"the muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4550",1837,"vanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then came the complaining","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4551",1837,"howl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"

"4553",1837,"were far removed from him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4554",1837,"the centre of a measureless solitude.","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4555",1837,"","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4556",1837,"He stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4557",1837,"experience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4558",1837,"overhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4559",1837,"came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand. <U+00A0>He","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4560",1837,"stepped back into the shadows and waited. <U+00A0>The lantern stood by the","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4561",1837,"open door of a barn. <U+00A0>The King waited some time--there was no sound,","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4562",1837,"and nobody stirring. <U+00A0>He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4563",1837,"barn looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4564",1837,"enter. He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4565",1837,"the threshold he heard voices behind him. <U+00A0>He darted behind a cask,","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4566",1837,"within the barn, and stooped down. <U+00A0>Two farm-labourers came in, bringing","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4567",1837,"the lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile. <U+00A0>Whilst they","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4568",1837,"moved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4569",1837,"the bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4570",1837,"of the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4571",1837,"himself. <U+00A0>He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4572",1837,"of the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4573",1837,"crown of England for one night.","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4574",1837,"","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4575",1837,"By-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4576",1837,"them and taking the lantern with them. <U+00A0>The shivering King made for the","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4577",1837,"blankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4578",1837,"up, and then groped his way safely to the stall. <U+00A0>Of two of the blankets","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4579",1837,"he made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two. <U+00A0>He was a","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4580",1837,"glad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4581",1837,"warm enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4582",1837,"suffocatingly powerful.","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4583",1837,"","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4584",1837,"Although the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4585",1837,"drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4586",1837,"of the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4587",1837,"semi-consciousness. <U+00A0>Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4588",1837,"wholly, he distinctly felt something touch him! <U+00A0>He was broad awake in","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4589",1837,"a moment, and gasping for breath. <U+00A0>The cold horror of that mysterious","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4590",1837,"touch in the dark almost made his heart stand still. <U+00A0>He lay motionless,","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4591",1837,"and listened, scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4592",1837,"no sound. <U+00A0>He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4593",1837,"time, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound. <U+00A0>So he began","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4594",1837,"to drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4595",1837,"mysterious touch again! <U+00A0>It was a grisly thing, this light touch from","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4596",1837,"this noiseless and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4597",1837,"fears. <U+00A0>What should he do? <U+00A0>That was the question; but he did not know","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4598",1837,"how to answer it. <U+00A0>Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4599",1837,"and fly from this inscrutable horror? <U+00A0>But fly whither? <U+00A0>He could","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4600",1837,"not get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4601",1837,"thither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls, with this","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4602",1837,"phantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4603",1837,"upon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was intolerable. <U+00A0>But to stay","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4604",1837,"where he was, and endure this living death all night--was that better?","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4605",1837,"<U+00A0>No. <U+00A0>What, then, was there left to do? <U+00A0>Ah, there was but one course;","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4606",1837,"he knew it well--he must put out his hand and find that thing!","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4607",1837,"","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4608",1837,"It was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4609",1837,"it. Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark,","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4610",1837,"gingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp--not because it","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4611",1837,"had encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4612",1837,"_going_ to. <U+00A0>But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4613",1837,"hand lightly swept against something soft and warm. <U+00A0>This petrified him,","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4614",1837,"nearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4615",1837,"the thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm.","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4616",1837,"He thought he would rather die than touch it again. <U+00A0>But he thought this","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4617",1837,"false thought because he did not know the immortal strength of","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4618",1837,"human curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4619",1837,"again--against his judgment, and without his consent--but groping","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4620",1837,"persistently on, just the same. <U+00A0>It encountered a bunch of long hair; he","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4621",1837,"shuddered, but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4622",1837,"rope; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!--for the rope was","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4623",1837,"not a rope at all, but the calf's tail.","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4624",1837,"","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4625",1837,"The King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"

"4627",1837,"need not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4628",1837,"him, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4629",1837,"any other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4630",1837,"suffered just as he had done.","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"

"4634",1837,"so lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4635",1837,"this humble animal were welcome. <U+00A0>And he had been so buffeted, so rudely","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4636",1837,"entreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4637",1837,"that he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4638",1837,"least a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4639",1837,"might be lacking. <U+00A0>So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4640",1837,"the calf.","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4641",1837,"","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
"4642",1837,"While stroking its sleek warm back--for it lay near him and within easy","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"

"4644",1837,"than one. <U+00A0>Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to","The Prince and the Pauper","Twain, Mark","Historical Fiction","en"
