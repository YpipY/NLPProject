"767",1848,"of the Spanish ship, had two living children, a son and a daughter,","Montezuma's Daughter","Haggard, H. Rider (Henry Rider)","Historical Fiction","en"

"778",1848,"first I went to school at Norwich I grieved more at losing sight of her","Montezuma's Daughter","Haggard, H. Rider (Henry Rider)","Historical Fiction","en"

"795",1848,"brothers, as is apt to be the case when a woman comes between friends","Montezuma's Daughter","Haggard, H. Rider (Henry Rider)","Historical Fiction","en"
