"1776",1896,"whom? I could not make a guess at that. I only knew that the plot was","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"
"1777",1896,"thickening, and began to feel the eagerness of the chase. Of course, if","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"

"1780",1896,"he might still be at the bottom of this. And, besides, I felt a natural","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"
"1781",1896,"curiosity. When Clon at last improved his pace, and went on to the","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"

"1783",1896,"ever learned, and scanned trodden mould and crushed leaves with eager","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"
"1784",1896,"eyes. But in vain. I could make nothing of it all, and rose at last with","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"

"1792",1896,"while we talked, and she seemed to be all the while on the watch, and","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"

"1795",1896,"certain than before that there was something strange on foot. What it","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"
"1796",1896,"was, and whether it had to do with M. de Cocheforet, I could not tell.","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"

"1897",1896,"a track through the thicket to the east of the house again, and so","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"
"1898",1896,"came back to the garden. This gained, she came up the path and went in","Under the Red Robe","Weyman, Stanley John","Historical Fiction","en"
