"4151",2034,"Then Edward had collected his scattered recollection, he was surprised","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4152",2034,"to observe the cavern totally deserted. Having arisen and put his dress","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4153",2034,"in some order, he looked more accurately round him; but all was still","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4154",2034,"solitary. If it had not been for the decayed brands of the fire, now","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4155",2034,"sunk into grey ashes, and the remnants of the festival, consisting","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4156",2034,"of bones half burnt and half gnawed, and an empty keg or two, there","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4157",2034,"remained no traces of Donald and his band. When Waverley sallied forth","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4158",2034,"to the entrance of the cave, he perceived that the point of rock, on","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4159",2034,"which remained the marks of last night's beacon, was accessible by","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4160",2034,"a small path, either natural, or roughly hewn in the rock, along the","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4161",2034,"little inlet of water which ran a few yards up into the cavern, where,","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4162",2034,"as in a wet-dock, the skiff which brought him there the night before","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4163",2034,"was still lying moored. When he reached the small projecting platform","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4164",2034,"on which the beacon had been established, he would have believed his","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4165",2034,"further progress by land impossible, only that it was scarce probable","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4166",2034,"but that the inhabitants of the cavern had some mode of issuing from it","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4167",2034,"otherwise than by the lake. Accordingly, he soon observed three or four","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4168",2034,"shelving steps, or ledges of rock, at the very extremity of the little","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4169",2034,"platform; and, making use of them as a staircase, he clambered by their","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4170",2034,"means around the projecting shoulder of the crag on which the cavern","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4171",2034,"opened, and, descending with some difficulty on the other side, he","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4172",2034,"gained the wild and precipitous shores of a Highland loch, about four","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4173",2034,"miles in length, and a mile and a half across, surrounded by heathy","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4174",2034,"and savage mountains, on the crests of which the morning mist was still","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"4176",2034,"","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4177",2034,"Looking back to the place from which he came, he could not help admiring","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4178",2034,"the address which had adopted a retreat of such seclusion and","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4179",2034,"secrecy. The rock, round the shoulder of which he had turned by a few","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4180",2034,"imperceptible notches, that barely afforded place for the foot, seemed,","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4181",2034,"in looking back upon it, a huge precipice, which barred all further","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4182",2034,"passage by the shores of the lake in that direction. There could be","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4183",2034,"no possibility, the breadth of the lake considered, of descrying the","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4184",2034,"entrance of the narrow and low-browed cave from the other side; so","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4185",2034,"that, unless the retreat had been sought for with boats, or disclosed","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4186",2034,"by treachery, it might be a safe and secret residence to its garrison","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4187",2034,"as long as they were supplied with provisions. Having satisfied his","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4188",2034,"curiosity in these particulars, Waverley looked around for Evan Dhu and","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4189",2034,"his attendants, who, he rightly judged, would be at no great distance,","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"4192",2034,"Accordingly, at the distance of about half a mile, he beheld a","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4193",2034,"Highlander (Evan apparently) angling in the lake, with another attending","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"4196",2034,"","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4197",2034,"Much nearer to the mouth of the cave, he heard the notes of a lively","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4198",2034,"Gaelic song, guided by which, in a sunny recess, shaded by a glittering","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"4202",2034,"eggs, barley-bread, fresh butter, and honeycomb. The poor girl had","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"4205",2034,"breakfast, being all delicacies which she had to beg or borrow from","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4206",2034,"distant cottagers. The followers of Donald Bean Lean used little food","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"4215",2034,"a petticoat, of scanty longitude, was her whole dress; but these were","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"4258",2034,"taken his MORNING with Donald Bean Lean, before his departure; he","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"4259",2034,"offered the same cordial to Alice and to Edward, which they both","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"4944",2034,"of enthusiasm. As he advanced in his declamation, his ardour seemed to","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"9221",2034,"preferable to the stupefying and intolerable uniformity of Janet's","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"9223",2034,"course when again at his own disposal. Two schemes seemed practicable,","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"9224",2034,"yet both attended with danger and difficulty. One was to go back to","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"9225",2034,"Glennaquoich, and join Fergus Mac-Ivor, by whom he was sure to be kindly","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"

"9227",2034,"he had been treated fully absolved him, in his own eyes, from his","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"9228",2034,"allegiance to the existing government. The other project was to","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"9229",2034,"endeavour to attain a Scottish seaport, and thence to take shipping for","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"9230",2034,"England. His mind wavered between these plans; and probably, if he","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"9231",2034,"had effected his escape in the manner he proposed, he would have been","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
"9232",2034,"finally determined by the comparative facility by which either might","Waverley; Or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since","Scott, Walter","Historical Fiction","en"
