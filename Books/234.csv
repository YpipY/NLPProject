"22",234,"into longing, so that he gave back to the said lord the havings he had","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"23",234,"conquered of him that he might lay the maiden in his kingly bed. So he","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"24",234,"brought her home with him to Oakenrealm and wedded her.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"35",234,"So he sent out the tokens and bade an hosting at his chief city, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"36",234,"when all was ready he said farewell to his wife and her babe unborn, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"37",234,"went his ways to battle once more: but fierce was his heart against the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"38",234,"foemen, that they had dragged him away from his love and his joy.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"40",234,"Even amidst of his land he joined battle with the host of the ravagers,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"43",234,"turned on him and cast his spear, and it reached him whereas his hawberk","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"44",234,"was broken, and stood deep in, so that he fell to earth unmighty: and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"45",234,"when his lords and chieftains drew about him, and cunning men strove to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"46",234,"heal him, it was of no avail, and he knew that his soul was departing.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"47",234,"Then he sent for a priest, and for the Marshal of the host, who was a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"48",234,"great lord, and the son of his father's brother, and in few words bade","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"49",234,"him look to the babe whom his wife bore about, and if it were a man, to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"50",234,"cherish him and do him to learn all that a king ought to know; and if it","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"51",234,"were a maiden, that he should look to her wedding well and worthily: and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"52",234,"he let swear him on his sword, on the edges and the hilts, that he would","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"53",234,"do even so, and be true unto his child if child there were: and he bade","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"54",234,"him have rule, if so be the lords would, and all the people, till the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"55",234,"child were of age to be king: and the Marshal swore, and all the lords","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"56",234,"who stood around bare witness to his swearing. Thereafter the priest","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"57",234,"houselled the King, and he received his Creator, and a little while","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"58",234,"after his soul departed.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"59",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"60",234,"But the Marshal followed up the fleeing foe, and two battles more he","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"61",234,"fought before he beat them flat to earth; and then they craved for","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"62",234,"peace, and he went back to the city in mickle honour.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"63",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"64",234,"But in the King's city of Oakenham he found but little joy; for both","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"65",234,"the King was bemoaned, whereas he had been no hard man to his folk; and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"66",234,"also, when the tidings and the King's corpse came back to Oakenrealm,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"67",234,"his Lady and Queen took sick for sorrow and fear, and fell into labour","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"68",234,"of her child, and in childing of a man-bairn she died, but the lad","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"69",234,"lived, and was like to do well.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"70",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"71",234,"So there was one funeral for the slain King and for her whom his slaying","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"72",234,"had slain: and when that was done, the little king was borne to the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"73",234,"font, and at his christening he gat to name Christopher.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"74",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"75",234,"Thereafter the Marshal summoned all them that were due thereto to come","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"76",234,"and give homage to the new king, and even so did they, though he were","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"77",234,"but a babe, yea, and who had but just now been a king lying in his","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"78",234,"mother's womb. But when the homage was done, then the Marshal called","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"79",234,"together the wise men, and told them how the King that was had given him","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"80",234,"in charge his son as then unborn, and the ruling of the realm till the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"81",234,"said son were come to man's estate: but he bade them seek one worthier","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"82",234,"if they had heart to gainsay the word of their dying lord. Then all they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"83",234,"said that he was worthy and mighty and the choice of their dear lord,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"84",234,"and that they would have none but he.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"85",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"86",234,"So then was the great folk-mote called, and the same matter was laid","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"87",234,"before all the people, and none said aught against it, whereas no man","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"88",234,"was ready to name another to that charge and rule, even had it been his","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"89",234,"own self.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"90",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"91",234,"Now then by law was the Marshal, who hight Rolf, lord and earl of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"92",234,"land of Oakenrealm. He ruled well and strongly, and was a fell warrior:","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"93",234,"he was well befriended by many of the great; and the rest of them feared","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"94",234,"him and his friends: as for the commonalty, they saw that he held the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"95",234,"realm in peace; and for the rest, they knew little and saw less of him,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"96",234,"and they paid to his bailiffs and sheriffs as little as they could, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"97",234,"more than they would. But whereas that left them somewhat to grind their","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"98",234,"teeth on, and they were not harried, they were not so ill content. So","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"99",234,"the Marshal throve, and lacked nothing of a king's place save the bare","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"108",234,"As for the King's son, to whom the folk had of late done homage as king,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"109",234,"he was at first seen about a corner of the High House with his nurses;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"110",234,"and then in a while it was said, and the tale noted, but not much, that","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"111",234,"he must needs go for his health's sake, and because he was puny, to some","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"112",234,"stead amongst the fields, and folk heard say that he was gone to the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"113",234,"strong house of a knight somewhat stricken in years, who was called Lord","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"114",234,"Richard the Lean. The said house was some twelve miles from Oakenham,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"115",234,"not far from the northern edge of the wild-wood. But in a while, scarce","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"116",234,"more than a year, Lord Richard brake up house at the said castle, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"117",234,"went southward through the forest. Of this departure was little said,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"118",234,"for he was not a man amongst the foremost. As for the King's little son,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"119",234,"if any remembered that he was in the hands of the said Lord Richard,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"120",234,"none said aught about it; for if any thought of the little babe at all,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"121",234,"they said to themselves, Never will he come to be king.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"122",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"123",234,"Now as for Lord Richard the Lean, he went far through the wood, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"124",234,"until he was come to another house of his, that stood in a clearing","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"125",234,"somewhat near to where Oakenrealm marched on another country, which","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"126",234,"hight Meadham; though the said wild-wood ended not where Oakenrealm","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"127",234,"ended, but stretched a good way into Meadham; and betwixt one and the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"128",234,"other much rough country there was.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"129",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"130",234,"It is to be said that amongst those who went to this stronghold of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"131",234,"woods was the little King Christopher, no longer puny, but a stout","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"132",234,"babe enough: so he was borne amongst the serving men and thralls to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"133",234,"the castle of the Outer March; and he was in no wise treated as a great","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"134",234,"man's son; but there was more than one woman who was kind to him, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"135",234,"as he waxed in strength and beauty month by month, both carle and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"136",234,"quean fell to noting him, and, for as little as he was, he began to be","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"137",234,"well-beloved.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"138",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"139",234,"As to the stead where he was nourished, though it were far away amongst","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"140",234,"the woods, it was no such lonely or savage place: besides the castle and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"141",234,"the houses of it, there was a merry thorpe in the clearing, the houses","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"142",234,"whereof were set down by the side of a clear and pleasant little stream.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"143",234,"Moreover the goodmen and swains of the said township were no ill folk,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"144",234,"but bold of heart, free of speech, and goodly of favour; and the women","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"145",234,"of them fair, kind, and trusty. Whiles came folk journeying in to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"146",234,"Oakenrealm or out to Meadham, and of these some were minstrels, who had","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"147",234,"with them tidings of what was astir whereas folk were thicker in the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"148",234,"world, and some chapmen, who chaffered with the thorpe-dwellers, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"149",234,"took of them the woodland spoil for such outland goods as those woodmen","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"153",234,"forgotten, and in the wild-wood had never been known clearly for King's","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"154",234,"son. At first, by command of Rolf the Marshal, a messenger came","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"155",234,"every year from Lord Richard with a letter that told of how the lad","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"156",234,"Christopher did. But when five years were worn, the Marshal bade send","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"157",234,"him tidings thereof every three years; and by then it was come to the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"158",234,"twelfth year, and still the tidings were that the lad throve ever, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"173",234,"King Christopher. A good man was this King Roland, mild, bounteous, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"174",234,"no regarder of persons in his justice; and well-beloved he was of his","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"176",234,"was of the age of twelve years, he sickened unto death; and so, when he","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"177",234,"knew that his end drew near, he sent for the wisest of his wise men,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"178",234,"and they came unto him sorrowing in the High House of his chiefest city,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"179",234,"which hight Meadhamstead. So he bade them sit down nigh unto his bed,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"180",234,"and took up the word and spake:","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"181",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"182",234,"""Masters, and my good lords, ye may see clearly that a sundering is at","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"183",234,"hand, and that I must needs make a long journey, whence I shall come","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"185",234,"leave behind me some good order in the land. Furthermore, I would that","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"401",234,"some easement which they might do unrebuked, or not sorely rebuked;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"436",234,"in his mind what these two were: and the woman answered his thought and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"437",234,"said: ""I am the Woman of the Woods, and the Landwight of Oakenrealm; and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"466",234,"Lord Richard the Lean, hastening and half afeard, and did obeisance to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"519",234,"as ye shall hear, was mighty, all the fashion of his limbs and his body","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"520",234,"was light and clean done, and beauteous; and though his skin, where it","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"521",234,"showed naked, was all tanned with the summer, it was fine and sleek and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"522",234,"kindly, every deal thereof: bright-eyed and round-cheeked he was, with","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"523",234,"full lips and carven chin, and his hair golden brown of hue, and curling","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"550",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"551",234,"But as he spake the words they seemed to his heart like a foretelling","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"552",234,"of evil, and he turned pale and trembled, and said to Christopher: ""Come","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"553",234,"hither, lad; I will give thee a gift, and then shalt thou depart till","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"557",234,"for the gracious gift of the ruler of Oakenrealm, and then went his ways","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"558",234,"out of the hall, and the folk without gave a glad cry as he came amongst","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"561",234,"But by then he was come to the door, Lord Rolf looked on his hand, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"562",234,"saw that, instead of giving the youngling a finger-ring which he had","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"563",234,"bought of a merchant for a price of five bezants, as he had meant to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1005",234,"with a short peaked beard and close-cut grizzled hair; he was high of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1006",234,"cheekbones, thin-faced, with grey eyes, both big and gentle-looking; he","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1013",234,"high-seat. Shortly to say it, his sons they were, as David and the two","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1160",234,"down and chucked me under the chin and put his hand on my head, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1161",234,"looked at my nurse and said: 'Yea, he is a big lad, and groweth apace,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1452",234,"bow-shots from the thicket, she heard the clatter of horse-hoofs on the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1454",234,"presently there was a key in the lock, the door opened, and a man came","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1455",234,"in walking stiffly, like a rider who has ridden far and fast. He was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1456",234,"clad in jack and sallet, and had a sword by his side, and on his sleeve","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1457",234,"was done in green and gold a mountain aflame; so that Goldilind knew him","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1458",234,"at once for a man of Earl Geoffrey's; and, indeed, she had seen the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1459",234,"man before, coming and going on errands that she knew nought of, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1460",234,"on which nothing followed that was of import to her. Therefore, as","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1461",234,"she watched him cross the garden and go straight up to the door of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1462",234,"Foresters' Tower, and take out another key and enter, she heeded him but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1463",234,"little, nor did his coming increase her trouble a whit.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1464",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1465",234,"She walked on toward the postern, and now she saw that the errand-bearer","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1466",234,"had left it open behind him, and when she came close up to it, she saw","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1467",234,"his horse tied to a ring in the wall, a strong and good bay nag. The","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1469",234,"the misery of her days and the yearning for the loveliness of the world","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1470",234,"without, converse of friends, hope of the sufficiency of desire, and the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1471",234,"sweetness of love returned. And so strong a wave of anguish swept over","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1472",234,"her, that she bowed her down upon the grass and wept bitterly. Yet but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1473",234,"a little while it lasted; she rose up presently and looked warily all","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1474",234,"round her, and up to the Castle, and saw none stirring; she drew up the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1475",234,"skirts of her green gown into her girdle, till the hem but just hid her","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1476",234,"knees; then she stepped lightly through the half-open door with flushed","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1497",234,"a forester some six miles away in the wood that morning, so the nag","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1498",234,"answered to her call for speed, and she went a great gallop into the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1499",234,"wood, and was hidden in a twinkling from any eyes that might be looking","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1500",234,"out of the Castle.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1501",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1502",234,"Without checking the nag she sped along, half mad with joy at the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1503",234,"freedom of this happy morn. Nigh aimless she was, but had an inkling","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1504",234,"that it were well with her if she could hold northward ever; for the old","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1507",234,"had gone as much of a gallop as she might for some half hour, she drew","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1508",234,"rein to breathe her nag, and hearkened; she turned in the saddle, but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1509",234,"heard nought to affright her, so she went on again, but some what more","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1510",234,"soberly; and thuswise she rode for some two hours, and the day waxed","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1511",234,"hot, and she was come to a clear pool amidst of a little clearing,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1514",234,"There she made stay, and got off her horse, and stood awhile by him","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1515",234,"as he cropped the sweet grass; and the birds sang at the edge of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1517",234,"water; and from the pool's edge the moorhens cried. She stood half","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1518",234,"leaning against the side of the horse till she became somewhat drowsy;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1521",234,"rubbed her eyes and smiled, and turned to the pool, where now a little","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1522",234,"ripple was running over the face of it, and a thought came upon her,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1525",234,"naked a little on the warm sunny grass, and then bestirred her and went","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1526",234,"lightly into the pool, and bathed and sported there, and then came on to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1527",234,"the grass again, and went to and fro to dry her in the air and sun. Then","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1528",234,"she did on her raiment again, and laid her down under a thorn-bush","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1532",234,"sprang up now and went to her horse, and drew the girths tight (which","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1533",234,"she had loosed erewhile,) and so bestrode the good horse, and shook the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1543",234,"betwixt her and Greenharbour. Within a three hours from her bathing she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1544",234,"fell a-hungering sore, and knew not what to do to eat, till she found a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1545",234,"pouch made fast to the saddle-bow, and therein a little white loaf, that","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1546",234,"and no more, which she took and ate the half of with great joy, sitting","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1547",234,"down by a brook-side, whence she had her drink.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1548",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1549",234,"Then again she mounted, and rode on till dusk overtook her just as she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1550",234,"came to a little river running from the north from pool to shallow, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1551",234,"shallow to pool. And whereas she was now exceeding weary, and the good","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1552",234,"horse also much spent, and that the grass was very sweet and soft down","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1553",234,"to the water's edge, and that there was a thick thorn-bush to cover her,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1554",234,"she made up her mind that this place should be her bed-chamber. So she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1555",234,"took saddle and bridle off the horse, as he must needs bite the grass,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1556",234,"and then when she had eaten the other half of her bread, she laid her","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1557",234,"down on the green grass, with her head on the saddle, and when she had","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1568",234,"When she awoke it was broad day and bright sun, and she rose up to her","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1569",234,"feet and looked about, and saw the horse standing close by, and sharing","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1570",234,"the shade with her, whisking his tail about lazily. Then she turned,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1571",234,"and saw the stream rippling out from the pool over the clean gravel, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1572",234,"here and there a fish darting through the ripple, or making clean rings","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1573",234,"on the pool as he quietly took a fly; the sky was blue and clear, there","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1574",234,"was scarce a breath of air, and the morning was already hot; no worse","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1575",234,"than yesterday sang the birds in the bushes; but as she looked across","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1576",234,"the river, where, forsooth, the alders grew thick about the pool's edge,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1577",234,"a cock blackbird, and then another, flew out from the close boughs,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1578",234,"where they had been singing to their mates, with the sharp cry that they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1579",234,"use when they are frighted. Withal she saw the bush move, though, as","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1580",234,"aforesaid, the morning was without wind. She had just stooped to do off","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1581",234,"her foot-gear (for she was minded to bathe again), but now she stopped","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1582",234,"with one shoe in her hand, and looked on the bushes keenly with beating","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1583",234,"heart, and again she thought she saw the boughs shaken, and stood, not","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1584",234,"daring to move a while; but they moved no more now when she had looked","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1585",234,"steadily at them a space, and again a blackbird began singing loud just","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1586",234,"where they had been shaken. So she gathered heart again, and presently","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1587",234,"turned her hand once more to stripping her raiment off her, for she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1588",234,"would not be baulked of her bath; but when the stripping was done,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1589",234,"she loitered not naked on the bank as she had done the day before, but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1590",234,"walked swiftly into the shallow, and thence down into the pool, till","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1591",234,"nothing but her head and the whiteness of her shoulders showed over the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1592",234,"dark water. Even then she turned her head about twice to look into the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1593",234,"over-side bushes, but when she saw nothing stir there she began to play","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1594",234,"in the water, but not for long, but came splashing through the shallow","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1595",234,"and hurried on her raiment.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1596",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1597",234,"When she was clad again she went up to the horse, and patted and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1598",234,"caressed him, and did bridle and saddle on him, and was going to climb","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1599",234,"upon him, when, of a sudden, she thought she would lead him across, lest","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1600",234,"there should be a hole near the other bank and he might stumble into","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1601",234,"it unwarily; so she bared her feet once more and trussed up her gown","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1602",234,"skirts, and so took the ford, leading the beast; the water was nowhere","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1603",234,"up to mid-leg of her, and she stepped ashore on to short and fine grass,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1604",234,"which spread like a meadow before her, with a big thorn or two scattered","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1605",234,"about it, and a little grassy hill beset with tall elms toward the top,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1606",234,"coming down into the flat of the meadow and drawing round it nearly up","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1607",234,"to the river on the north side.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1608",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1609",234,"But now she stood staring in wonder and some deal of fear; for there","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1610",234,"were three milch kine feeding on the meadow, and, moreover, under a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1611",234,"thorn, scarce a hundred yards from where she stood, was a tall man","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1612",234,"standing gazing on her. So stricken was she that she might neither cry","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1613",234,"out nor turn aside; neither did she think to pull her gown out of her","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1614",234,"girdle to cover the nakedness of her legs.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1615",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1616",234,"When they had thus stood a little while the man began to move toward","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1617",234,"her very slowly, nor did she dare to flee any the more. But when he was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1618",234,"within half a dozen paces her face flushed red, and she did pull her","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1619",234,"gown out of its trusses and let it flow down. But he spake to her in a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1620",234,"pleasant voice, and said: ""May I speak to thee, maiden?""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1621",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1622",234,"Fear was yet in her soul, so that she might not speak for a little, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1623",234,"then she said: ""O, I beseech thee, bring me not back to Greenharbour!""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1624",234,"And she paled sorely as she spake the word.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1625",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1626",234,"But he said: ""I wot not of Greenharbour, how to find the way thereto,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1627",234,"though we have heard of it. But comfort thyself, I pray thee, there is","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1628",234,"nought to fear in me.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1629",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1630",234,"The sound of his voice was full pleasant to her, and when she hearkened","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1631",234,"him, how kind and frank it was, then she knew how much of terror was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1632",234,"blent with her joy in her newly-won freedom and the delight of the kind","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1633",234,"and happy words. Yet still she spoke not, and was both shamefast and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1634",234,"still not altogether unafraid. Yet, sooth to say, though his attire was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1635",234,"but simple, he was nought wild or fierce to look on. From time to time","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1636",234,"she looked on him, and then dropped her eyes again. In those glances she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1637",234,"saw that he was grey-eyed, and smooth-cheeked, and round-chinned, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1638",234,"his hair curly and golden; and she must needs think that she had never","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1639",234,"seen any face half so fair. He was clad but in a green coat that came","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1640",234,"not down to his knees, and brogues were tied to his feet, and no more","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1641",234,"raiment he had; and for hat he had made him a garland of white may","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1642",234,"blossom, and well it sat there: and again she looked on him, and thought","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1643",234,"him no worse than the running angel that goes before the throne of God","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1644",234,"in the picture of the choir of Meadhamstead; and she looked on him and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1645",234,"marvelled.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1646",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1647",234,"Now she hung her head before him and wished he would speak, and even so","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1648",234,"did he, and said: ""Maiden, when I first saw thee from amidst of the bush","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1649",234,"by the river yonder, I deemed thou wert a wood-wight, or some one of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1650",234,"she-Gods of the Gentiles come back hither. For this is a lonely place,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1651",234,"and some might deem that the Devil hath might here more than in other","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1652",234,"places; and when I saw thee, that thou wouldst do off thy raiment to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1653",234,"bathe thee, though soothly I longed to lie hidden there, I feared thee,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1654",234,"lest thou shouldst be angry with me if I were to see thee unclad; so I","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1655",234,"came away; yet I went not far, for I was above all things yearning to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1656",234,"see thee; and sooth it is, that hadst thou not crossed the water, I","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1657",234,"should presently have crossed it myself to seek thee, wert thou Goddess,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1658",234,"or wood-wife, or whatever might have come of it. But now thou art come","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1659",234,"to us, and I have heard thy voice beseeching me not to bring thee to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1660",234,"Greenharbour, I see that thou art a woman of the kindred of Adam. And","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1661",234,"yet so it is, that even now I fear thee somewhat. Yet I will pray thee","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1662",234,"not to be wroth if I ask thee whether I may do aught for thy need.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1663",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1664",234,"Now she began somewhat to smile, and she looked him full in the face,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1665",234,"and said: ""Forsooth, my need is simple, for I am hungry.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1666",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1667",234,"He smote himself on the breast, and said: ""See now, what a great fool I","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1668",234,"am, not to have known it without telling, instead of making long-winded","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1669",234,"talk about myself. Come quickly, dear maiden, and leave thine horse to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1670",234,"crop the grass.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1671",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1672",234,"So he hurried on to the thorn-bush aforesaid, and she went foot to foot","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1673",234,"with him, but he touched her not; and straightway she sat her down on","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1674",234,"the root of the thorn, and smiled frankly on him, and said:","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1675",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1676",234,"""Nay, sir, and now thou hast made me go all this way I am out of breath","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1677",234,"and weary, so I pray thee of the victual at once.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1678",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1679",234,"But he had been busy with his scrip which he had left cast down there,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1680",234,"and therewithal reached out to her a mighty hunch of bread and a piece","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1681",234,"of white cheese, and said:","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1682",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1683",234,"""Now shall I fetch thee milk."" Wherewith he took up a bowl of aspen tree","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1684",234,"that had lain by the scrip, and ran off to one of the kine and milked","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1685",234,"the bowl full, and came back with it heedfully, and set it down beside","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1686",234,"her and said: ""This was the nighest thing to hand, but when thou hast","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1687",234,"eaten and rested then shall we go to our house, if thou wilt be so kind","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1689",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1690",234,"She looked up at him smiling, but her pleasure of the meat and the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1691",234,"kindness was so exceeding, that she might not refrain from tears also,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1693",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1694",234,"As for him, he knelt beside her, looking on her wistfully; and at last","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1695",234,"he said: ""I shall tell thee, that I am glad that thou wert hungry and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1910",234,"they were by his onset, and he hewed at them again and drave them aback","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1911",234,"to the threshold of the door: but could get them no further, and they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1912",234,"began to handle long spears to thrust at him.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1913",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1914",234,"But then came forward a knight, no mickle man, but clad in very goodly","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1915",234,"armour, with a lion beaten in gold on his green surcoat; this man smote","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1916",234,"up the spears, and made the men go back a little, while he stood on the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1917",234,"threshold; so Christopher saw that he would parley with him, and forbore","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1918",234,"him, and the knight spake: ""Thou youngling, art thou mad? What doest","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1920",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1925",234,"But the knight, who had no weapon in his hand, said: ""We come but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1934",234,"and stood beside Christopher, and said: ""Sir Burgreve, we rode forth to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1935",234,"drink the air yesterday, and went astray amidst the wild-wood, and were","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1936",234,"belated, so that we must needs lie down under the bare heaven; but this","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1937",234,"morning we happened on this kind forester, who gave us to eat, and took","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1938",234,"us to his house and gave us meat and drink; for which it were seemlier","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1939",234,"to reward him than threaten him. Now it is our pleasure that ye lead us","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1940",234,"back to Greenharbour; but as for this youth, that ye do him no hurt, but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1944",234,"was to be seen of her that all grief was in her heart, though her words","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1948",234,"slain here and now, needs must he with us. For he hath slain two of our","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1949",234,"men outright, and hath hurt many, and, methinks, the devil of the woods","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1962",234,"the stoutest came up unto Christopher where he sat, and bound his hands","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1963",234,"with their girdles, and he withstood them no whit, but sat laughing in","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1964",234,"their faces, and made as if it were all a Yule-tide game. But inwardly","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1965",234,"his heart burned with anger, and with love of that sweet Lady.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1966",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1967",234,"Then they made him stand up, and led him without the house, and set him","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1986",234,"and one of her women, but not Aloyse, waited on her, and when she tried","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1987",234,"to have some tidings of her, the woman spake to her no more than if she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1988",234,"were dumb. So all unhappily she laid her down in her bed, foreboding the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1989",234,"worst, which she deemed might well be death at the hand of her jailers.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1990",234,"As for Christopher, she saw the last of him as they entered the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2542",234,"from her chair, as fair as a June lily, and came to Christopher and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2670",234,"and the day as fair and bright as might be. Christopher held his peace","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2671",234,"for sweet shame that he was alone with a most fair maid, and she his","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2672",234,"own, and without defence against him. But she amidst of her silence","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2673",234,"turned, now red, and now somewhat pale, and now and again she looked","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2674",234,"somewhat askance on him, and he deemed her looks were no kinder than","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2688",234,"looking at him: ""A house of woodmen and wolf-heads. Is that a meet","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2689",234,"dwelling-place for me? Didst thou hear men at Greenharbour say that I am","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2695",234,"She said: ""And dost thou mock me with that? thou?"" And she burst out","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2696",234,"weeping. He answered not, for sore grief smote him, remembering her hand","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2697",234,"in his but a little while ago. And again she hurried on, and he followed","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2705",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2706",234,"Then said she: ""Thou sayest sooth, thou hast not wooed me, but taken","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2707",234,"me."" She laughed therewith, as one in bitterness. But presently she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2708",234,"turned to him, and he wondered, for in her face was longing and kindness","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2709",234,"nought like to her words. But he durst not speak to her lest he should","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2710",234,"anger her, and she turned her face from him again: and she said: ""Wert","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2712",234,"Queen to the Churl, the Wood-man, the Wolf-head."" And again she rode on,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2713",234,"and he followed, sick at heart and wondering sorely.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2715",234,"When they were riding together again, they spake not to each other,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2717",234,"knit brows and a stern countenance. So in a while she began to speak to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2718",234,"him again, but as if there were nought but courtesy between them, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2719",234,"neither love nor hatred. She fell to asking him of woodland matters,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2720",234,"concerning bird and beast and things creeping; and at first he would","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2721",234,"scarce answer her at all, and then were his answers short; but at last,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2722",234,"despite of all, he began to forget both grief and anger, so much the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2723",234,"sweetness of her speech wound about his heart; and, withal, she fell to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2724",234,"asking him of his fellows and their life in the woods, and of Jack of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2725",234,"the Tofts and the like; and now he answered her questions fully, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2726",234,"whiles she laughed at his words, and he laughed also; and all pleasure","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2727",234,"had there been of this converse, if he had not beheld her from time to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2728",234,"time and longed for the fairness of her body, and feared her wrath at","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2730",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2731",234,"So wore the day, and the sun was getting low, and they were come to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2732",234,"another woodland pool which was fed by a clear-running little brook,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2733",234,"and up from it went a low bank of greensward exceeding sweet, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2734",234,"beyond that oak trees wide-branched and great, and still fair greensward","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2736",234,"reined up, and looked about her, but Christopher looked on her and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2737",234,"nought else. But she said: ""Let to-morrow bring counsel; but now am I","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2738",234,"weary to-night, and if we are not to ride night-long, we shall belike","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2739",234,"find no better place to rest in. Wilt thou keep watch while I sleep?""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2740",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2741",234,"""Yea,"" he said, bowing his head to her soberly; and therewith he got","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2742",234,"off his horse, and would have helped her down from hers, but she slipped","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2743",234,"lightly down and stood before him face to face, and they were very nigh","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2744",234,"to each other, she standing close to her horse. Her face was pale to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2745",234,"his deeming and there was a piteous look in her eyes, so that he yearned","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2746",234,"towards her in his bowels, and reached his hand toward her; but she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2747",234,"shrank aback, leaning against her horse, and said in a trembling voice,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2748",234,"looking full at him, and growing yet paler: ""Forester, dost thou think","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2749",234,"it seemly that thou shouldst ride with us, thou such as thou hast told","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2750",234,"thyself to be, in this lordly raiment, which they gave thee yonder as","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2751",234,"part of the price for thy leading us away into the wild-wood?""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2752",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2753",234,"""Lady,"" said he, ""whether it be seemly or not, I see that it is thy will","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2754",234,"that I should go clad as a woodland churl; abide a little, and thy will","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2757",234,"Therewith he did off the burden from the sumpter horse, and set the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2758",234,"chests on the earth; then he took her horse gently, and led him with","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2759",234,"the other two in under the oak trees, and there he tethered them so that","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2760",234,"they could bite the grass; and came back thereafter, and took his old","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2761",234,"raiment out of the chest, and said: ""What thou wilt have me do, I","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2762",234,"will do now; and this all the more as to-morrow I should have done it","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2763",234,"unbidden, and should have prayed thee to do on garments less glorious","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2764",234,"than now thou bearest; so that we may look the less strange in the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2766",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2767",234,"Nought she answered as he turned toward the hazel copse; she had been","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2768",234,"following him with her eyes while he was about that business, and when","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2769",234,"his back was turned, she stood a moment till her bosom fell a-heaving,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2770",234,"and she wept; then she turned her about to the chest wherein was her","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2771",234,"raiment, and went hastily and did off her glorious array, and did on the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2772",234,"green gown wherewith she had fled, and left her feet bare withal.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2774",234,"hazel-thicket new clad in his old raiment, and she cried out aloud, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2775",234,"ran toward him. But he doubted that some evil had betid, and that she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2776",234,"was chased; so he drew out his sword; but she ran up to him and cried","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2777",234,"out: ""Put up thy sword, here is none save me.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2778",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2779",234,"But he stood still, gazing on her in wonderment, and now she was drawn","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2780",234,"near to him she stood still before him, panting. Then he said: ""Nay,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2781",234,"Lady, for this night there was no need of thy disguising thee, to-morrow","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2783",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2784",234,"She said: ""I were fain if thou wouldst take my hand, and lead me back to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2788",234,"and a flood of sweetness swept over his heart, and made an end of all","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2789",234,"its soreness. But he led her quietly back again to their place. Then she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2790",234,"turned to him and said: ""Now art thou the woodland god again, and the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2791",234,"courtier no more; so now will I worship thee."" And she knelt down before","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2792",234,"him, and embraced his knees and kissed them; but he drew her up to him,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2793",234,"and cast his arms about her, and kissed her face many times, and said:","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2798",234,"about it I longed for thee to break it down with the fierceness of a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2799",234,"man, and bid me look to it how helpless I was, and thou how strong and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2800",234,"my only defence. Not utterly feigned it was: for I will say it, that","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2801",234,"I was grieved to the heart when I bethought me of Meadhamstead and the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2806",234,"He took her by the shoulders and bent her backwards to kiss her, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2807",234,"held her up above the earth in his arms, waving her this way and that,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2808",234,"till she felt how little and light she was in his grasp, though she was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2809",234,"no puny woman; then he set her on her feet again, and laughed in her","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2810",234,"face, and said: ""Sweetling, let to-morrow bring counsel. But now let it","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2844",234,"coming on foot over the greensward toward her. She was afraid, so that","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2845",234,"she durst not put out a hand to awaken Christopher, but sat gazing on","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2847",234,"clad much as Christopher; but presently she saw that there was a woman","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2848",234,"with them, and she took heart somewhat thereat; and she noted that one","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2849",234,"of the men was short-haired and dark-haired, and the other had long red","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2850",234,"hair falling about his shoulders; and as she put out her hand and laid","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2851",234,"it on Christopher's shoulder, the red-haired one looked toward her a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2852",234,"moment under the sharp of his hand (for the sun was on their side),","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2853",234,"and then set off running, giving out a great whoop therewithal. Even","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2856",234,"both cheeks; so that Goldilind saw that these were the fellows whereof","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2857",234,"Christopher had told, and she stood there shame-fast and smiling.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2859",234,"Presently came up the others, to wit, Gilbert and Joanna, and they also","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2860",234,"kissed and embraced Christopher, and all they were as full of joy as","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2861",234,"might be. Then came Joanna to Goldilind, and said: ""I wot not who this","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2870",234,"their tales we shall tell ours."" And she took her hand and they went","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2871",234,"into the hazels; but the two new-come men seemed to find it hard to keep","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3043",234,"edges of the thicket were the nightingales singing loud and sweet, but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3044",234,"within was the turmoil of many voices, whereof few heeded if their words","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3045",234,"were loud or soft.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3046",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3047",234,"Amidst all this, from close to the hall, rang out the sound of many","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3048",234,"horns winding a woodland tune. None was afeard or astonied, because","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3049",234,"all knew it for the horns of Jack of the Tofts; but they stilled their","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3050",234,"chattering talk somewhat, and abided his coming; and even therewith came","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3051",234,"the sound of many feet and the clash of weapons, and men poured in, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3052",234,"there was the gleam of steel, as folk fell back to the right and left,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3053",234,"and gave room to the new-comers. Then a loud, clear, and cheery voice","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3054",234,"cried out from amidst of them: ""Light in the hall, men and maids!","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3055",234,"Candles, candles! Let see who is here before us!""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3056",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3057",234,"Straightway then was there running hither and thither and light sprang","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3058",234,"up over all the hall, and there could folk see Jack of the Tofts, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3059",234,"a score and a half of his best, every man of them armed with shield and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3060",234,"helm and byrny, with green coats over their armour, and wreaths of young","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3061",234,"oak about their basnets; there they stood amidst of the hall, and every","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3062",234,"man with his naked sword in his fist. Jack stood before his folk clad in","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3063",234,"like wise with them, save that his head was bare but for an oak wreath.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3064",234,"Men looked on a while and said nought, while Jack looked proudly and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3065",234,"keenly over the hall, and at last his eye caught Christopher's, but he","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3066",234,"made the youngling no semblance of greeting. Christopher's heart fell,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3067",234,"and he misdoubted if something were not wrong; but he spake softly to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3068",234,"one who stood by him, and said: ""Is aught amiss, Will Ashcroft? this is","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3069",234,"not the wont here.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3070",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3071",234,"Said the other: ""Not in thy time; but for the last seven days it hath","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3072",234,"been the wont, and then off weapons and to supper peaceably.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3080",234,"Even therewith, and while the last word had but come to Christopher's","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3081",234,"ears, rang out the voice of Jack of the Tofts again, louder and clearer","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3082",234,"than before: and he said: ""Men in this hall, I bear you tidings! The","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3083",234,"King of Oakenrealm is amongst us to-night.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3084",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3085",234,"Then, forsooth, was the noise and the turmoil, and cries and shouts and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3086",234,"clatter, and fists raised in air and weapons caught down from the wall,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3087",234,"and the glitter of spear-points and gleam of fallow blades. For the name","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3088",234,"of Rolf, King of Oakenrealm, was to those woodmen as the name of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3089",234,"Great Devil of Hell, so much was he their unfriend and their dastard.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3090",234,"But Jack raised up his hand, and cried: ""Silence ye! Blow up, horns, The","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3093",234,"Blared out the horns then, strong and fierce, under the hall-roof, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3094",234,"when they were done, there was more silence in the hall than in the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3095",234,"summer night without; only the voice of the swords could not be utterly","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3096",234,"still, but yet tinkled and rang as hard came against hard here and there","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3097",234,"in the hush.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3098",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3099",234,"Again spake Jack: ""Let no man speak! Let no man move from his place! I","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3100",234,"SEE THE KING! Ye shall see him!""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3101",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3102",234,"Therewith he strode up the hall and on to the dais, and came up to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3103",234,"where stood Christopher holding Goldilind's hand, and she all pale","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3104",234,"and trembling; but Jack took him by the shoulder, and turned him about","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3105",234,"toward a seat which stood before the board, so that all men in the hall","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3106",234,"could see it; then he set him down in it, and took his sword from his","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3107",234,"girdle, and knelt down before the young man, and took his right hand,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3108",234,"and said in a loud voice: ""I, Jack of the Tofts, a free man and a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3109",234,"sackless, wrongfully beguilted, am the man of King Christopher of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3110",234,"Oakenrealm, to live and die for him as need may be. Lo, Lord, my","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3111",234,"father's blade! Wilt thou be good to me and gird me therewith, as thy","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3113",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3114",234,"Now when Christopher heard him, at first he deemed that all this","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3115",234,"was some sport or play done for his pastime and the pleasure of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3116",234,"hall-folk in all kindness and honour. But when he looked in the eyes of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3117",234,"him, and saw him fierce and eager and true, he knew well it was no jest;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3118",234,"and as the shouts of men went up from the hall and beat against the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3119",234,"roof, himseemed that he remembered, as in a dream, folk talking a-nigh","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3120",234,"him when he was too little to understand, of a king and his son, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3121",234,"a mighty man turned thief and betrayer. Then his brow cleared, and his","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3122",234,"eyes shone bright, and he leaned forward to Jack and girt him with the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3123",234,"sword, and kissed his mouth, and said: ""Thou art indeed my man and my","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3124",234,"thane and my earl, and I gird thee with thy sword as my father girded","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3126",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3127",234,"Then stood up Jack o' the Tofts and said: ""Men in this hall, happy is","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3128",234,"the hour, and happy are ye! This man is the King of Oakenrealm, and he","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3129",234,"yonder is but a thief of kings, a dastard!""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3130",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3131",234,"And again great was the shouting, for carle and quean, young and old,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3132",234,"they loved Christopher well: and Jack of the Tofts was not only their","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3133",234,"war-duke and alderman, but their wise man also, and none had any thought","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3134",234,"of gainsaying him. But he spake again and said: ""Is there here any old","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3135",234,"man, or not so old, who hath of past days seen our King that was, King","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3136",234,"Christopher to wit, who fell in battle on our behalf? If so there be,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3138",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3139",234,"Then arose a greybeard from a bench nigh the high-table, and came up on","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3140",234,"to the dais; a very tall man had he been, but was now somewhat bowed by","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3141",234,"age. He now knelt before Christopher, and took his hand, and said: ""I,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3142",234,"William of Whittenham, a free man, a knight, sackless of the guilt which","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3143",234,"is laid on me, would be thy man, O my lord King, to serve thee in all","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3144",234,"wise; if so be that I may live to strike one stroke for my master's son,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3145",234,"whom now I see, the very living image of the King whom I served in my","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3146",234,"youth.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3147",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3148",234,"Then Christopher bent down to him and kissed him, and said: ""Thou art","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3149",234,"indeed my man and my thane & my baron; and who knows but that thou mayst","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3150",234,"have many a stroke to strike for me in the days that are nigh at hand.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3151",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3152",234,"And again the people shouted: and then there came another and another,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3153",234,"and ten more squires and knights and men of estate, who were now indeed","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3154",234,"woodmen and wolf-heads, but who, the worst of them, were sackless of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3155",234,"aught save slaying an unfriend, or a friend's unfriend, in fair fight;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3156",234,"and all these kneeled before him, and put their hands in his, and gave","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3157",234,"themselves unto him.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3158",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3159",234,"When this was done, there came thrusting through the throng of the hall","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3160",234,"a tall woman, old, yet comely as for her age; she went right up on to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3161",234,"the dais, and came to where sat Christopher, and without more ado","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3162",234,"cast her arms about him and kissed him, and then she held him by the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3163",234,"shoulders and cried out: ""O, have I found thee at last, my loveling,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3164",234,"and my dear, and my nurse-chick? and thou grown so lovely and yet so big","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3165",234,"that I may never more hold thee aloft in mine arms, as once I was wont;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3166",234,"though high enough belike thou shalt be lifted; and I say praise be to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3167",234,"God and to his Hallows that thou art grown so beauteous and mighty a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3170",234,"Therewith she turned about toward the hall-throng and said: ""Thou, duke","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3171",234,"of these woodmen, and all ye in this hall, I have been brought hither","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3172",234,"by one of you; and though I have well-nigh died of joy because of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3173",234,"suddenness of this meeting, yet I thank him therefor. For who is","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3174",234,"this goodly and gracious young man save the King's son of Oakenrealm,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3175",234,"Christopher that was; and that to my certain knowledge; for he is my","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3176",234,"fosterling and my milk-child, and I took him from the hands of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3177",234,"midwife in the High House of Oakenham a twenty-one years ago; and they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3178",234,"took him from Oakenham, and me with him to the house of Lord Richard the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3179",234,"Lean, at Longholms, and there we dwelt; but in a little while they took","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3180",234,"him away from Longholms to I wot not whither, but would not suffer me","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3181",234,"to go along with him, and ever sithence have I been wandering about and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3182",234,"hoping to see this lovely child again, and now I see him, what he is,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3184",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3185",234,"Once more then was there stir and glad tumult in the hall. But Goldilind","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3186",234,"stood wondering, and fear entered into her soul; for she saw before her","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3187",234,"a time of turmoil and unpeace, and there seemed too much between her and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3188",234,"the sweetness of her love. Withal it must be said, that for as little","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3189",234,"as she knew of courts and war-hosts, she yet seemed to see lands without","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3190",234,"that hall, and hosts marching, and mighty walls glittering with spears,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3191",234,"and the banners of a great King displayed; and Jack of the Tofts and his","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3192",234,"champions and good fellows seemed but a frail defence against all that,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3193",234,"when once the hidden should be shown, and the scantiness of the woodland","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3194",234,"should cry on the abundance of the kingdom to bow down.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3195",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3196",234,"Now she came round the board and stood beside Christopher, and he turned","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3197",234,"to her, and stood up and took her hand, in such wise that she felt the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3198",234,"caress of it; and joy filled her soul, as if she had been alone with him","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3199",234,"in the wild-wood.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3200",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3201",234,"But he spake and said: ""All ye my friends: I see and wot well that ye","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3202",234,"would have me sit in my father's seat and be the King of Oakenrealm,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3203",234,"and that ye will give me help and furtherance therein to the utmost; nor","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3204",234,"will I cast back the gift upon you; and I will say this, that when I am","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3205",234,"King indeed, it is my meaning and my will now, that then I shall be","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3206",234,"no less one of you good fellows and kind friends than ye have known me","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3207",234,"hitherto; and even so I deem that ye think of me. But, good friends, it","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3208",234,"is not to be hidden that the road ye would have me wend with you is like","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3209",234,"to be rough; and it may well be that we shall not come to be kings or","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3210",234,"kings' friends but men hunted, and often, maybe, men taken and slain.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3211",234,"Therefore, till one thing or the other come, the kingship, or the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3212",234,"taking, I will try to be no less joyous than now I am, and so meseemeth","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3213",234,"shall ye; and if ye be of this mind, then shall the coming days be no","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3214",234,"worse than the days which have been; and God wot they have been happy","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3215",234,"enough. Now again, ye see this most fair lady, whose hand I hold; she","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3216",234,"is my beloved and my wife; and therewithal she is the true Queen of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3217",234,"Meadham, and a traitor sits in her place even as a traitor sits in mine.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3218",234,"But I must tell you that when she took me for her beloved, she knew not,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3219",234,"nor did I, that I was a King's son, but she took me as a woodman and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3220",234,"an outcast, and as a wood-man and outcast I wooed her, trusting in the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3221",234,"might that was in my body, and the love that was in my heart; and now","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3222",234,"before all you, my friends, I thank her and worship her that my body and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3223",234,"my love was enough for her; as, God wot, the kingship of the whole earth","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3224",234,"should not be overmuch for her, if it lay open to her to take. But,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3414",234,"fall on this stead if we leave them behind here with none to guard them;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3415",234,"and if, on the other hand, we leave them men enough for their warding,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3430",234,"of leaving the women behind, at least the younger ones, even had they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3431",234,"been safe at the Tofts; for there is no time when a man would gladlier","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3454",234,"Goldilind before them, clad in her green gown, and as fresh and dear","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3455",234,"as the early day itself. And Jack looked on her and said: ""And thou, my","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3462",234,"""Nay,"" said King Christopher, reddening, ""it is for thee to yea-say or","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3466",234,"But Jack laughed and said: ""Well, then, so be it; but let us get to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3477",234,"Christopher took her hand and kissed it, and said: ""Sweetling, why","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3478",234,"didst thou tell me nought of thy will to come along with us? Never had I","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3485",234,"louted down from her saddle, and they kissed together sweetly, and so","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3487",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3488",234,"So came they to the plain of Hazeldale, which was a wide valley with a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3489",234,"middling river winding about it, the wild-wood at its back toward the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3490",234,"Tofts, and in front down-land nought wooded, save here and there a tree","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3491",234,"nigh a homestead or cot; for that way the land was builded for a space.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3492",234,"Forsooth it was not easy for the folk thereabout to live quietly, but if","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3494",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3495",234,"So when the company of the Tofts came out into the dale about three","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3496",234,"hours after noon, it was no wonder to them to see men riding and going","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3497",234,"to and fro, and folk pitching tents and raising booths nigh to the cover","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3498",234,"of the wood; and when the coming of the Toft-folk was seen, and the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3499",234,"winding of their horns heard, there was many a glad cry raised in","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3500",234,"answer, and many an horn blown, and all men there came running together","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3501",234,"toward where now was stayed Jack of the Tofts and Christopher and their","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3502",234,"men.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3503",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3504",234,"Then Goldilind bade Christopher help her light down; so he took her in","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3505",234,"his arms, and was not over hasty in setting her down again. But when","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3506",234,"she stood by him, she looked over the sunny field darkened by the folk","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3507",234,"hastening over the greensward, and her eyes glittered and her cheek","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3508",234,"flushed, and she said: ""Lord King, be these some others of thy men?""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3509",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3510",234,"""Yea, sweetling,"" said he, ""to live and die with me.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3511",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3512",234,"She looked on him, and said softly: ""Maybe it were an ill wish to wish","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3513",234,"that I were thou; yet if it might be for one hour!""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3514",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3515",234,"Said he: ""Shall it not be for more than one hour? Shall it not be for","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3516",234,"evermore, since we twain are become one?""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3517",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3518",234,"""Nay,"" she said, ""this is but a word; I am but thine handmaid: and now I","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3519",234,"can scarce refrain my body from falling before thy feet.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3520",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3521",234,"He laughed in her face for joy, and said: ""Abide a while, until these","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3527",234,"albeit some were old, and some scarce of man's age. So they were ranked","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3528",234,"and told over, and the tale of them was over six score who had obeyed","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3529",234,"the war-arrow, and more and more, they said, would come in every hour.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3530",234,"But now the Captains of them bade the Toft-folk eat with them; and they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3531",234,"yea-said the bidding merrily, and word was given, and sacks and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3546",234,"came on hastily toward the feasters by the wood-edge. Then would some","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3547",234,"have run to meet them, but Jack of the Tofts bade them abide till he had","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4050",234,"this or the other company. And it was so areded that the Brimside men","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4051",234,"should fare first at the head of the host with the banner of Brimside,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4052",234,"and that then should go the mingled folk of the country-side, and lastly","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4053",234,"the folk of the Tofts with the banner of Oakenrealm; so that if the host","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4054",234,"came upon foemen, they might be for a cloud to hide the intent of their","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4058",234,"crossed the river to the men of Brimside, who gave them good cheer when","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4059",234,"they came amongst them; and it was hard to order the host for a while,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4060",234,"so did the upland folk throng about the King and the Queen; and happy","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4061",234,"were they who had a full look on Goldilind; and yet were some so lucky","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4062",234,"and so bold that they kissed a hand of her; and one there was, a very","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4066",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4067",234,"As for Christopher, he spake to many, and said to them that wheresoever","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4069",234,"upon unpeace; and so soon as they gat to the road, he went from company","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4070",234,"to company, speaking to many, and that so sweetly and friendly that all","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4071",234,"praised him, and said that here forsooth was a king who was all good and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4072",234,"nothing bad, whereas hitherto men had deemed them lucky indeed if their","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4074",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4075",234,"Merry then was the road to Broadlees, and they came there before","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4076",234,"night-fall; and it was a little cheaping town and unwalled, and if the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4077",234,"folk had had any will to ward them, they lacked might. But when they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4078",234,"found they were not to be robbed, and that it was but the proclaiming of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4079",234,"King Christopher in the market-place, and finding victual and house-room","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4080",234,"for the host, and the Mayor taking a paper in payment thereof, none","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4081",234,"stirred against them, and a many joined the host to fight for the fair","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4082",234,"young King. Now nought as yet had they heard at Broadlees of any force","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4083",234,"stirring against them.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4084",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4085",234,"But in the morning when they went on their ways again, and were","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4086",234,"bound for Cheaping Woodwall, which was a fenced town, they sent out","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4087",234,"well-horsed riders to espy the road, who came back on the spur two","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4088",234,"hours after noon, and did them to wit that there was a host abiding them","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4089",234,"beneath the walls of Woodwall under the banner of Walter the White, an","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4090",234,"old warrior and fell fighter; but what comfort he might have from them","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4091",234,"of Woodwall they wotted not; but they said that the tidings of their","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4092",234,"coming had gone abroad, and many folk were abiding the issue of this","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4093",234,"battle ere they joined them to either host. Now on these tidings the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4094",234,"captains were of one mind, to wit, to fare on softly till they came to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4095",234,"a defensible place not far from the foemen, since they could scarce come","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4096",234,"to Woodwall in good order before nightfall, and if they were unfoughten","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4097",234,"before, to push forward to battle in the morning.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4098",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4099",234,"Even so did they, and made a halt at sunset on a pleasant hill above a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4100",234,"river some three miles from Woodwall, and there they passed the night","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4109",234,"When morning was, the captains came to King Christopher to council:","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4110",234,"but while they were amidst of their talk came the word that the foe was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4111",234,"anigh and come close to the river-bank; whereat was none abashed; but to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4112",234,"all it seemed wisdom to abide them on the vantage-ground. So then there","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4113",234,"was girding of swords and doing on of helms; as for ordering of the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4114",234,"folk, it was already done, for all the host was ranked on the bent-side,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4115",234,"with the banner of Oakenrealm in the midst; on its left hand the banner","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4116",234,"of the Tofts, and on the right the banner of Brimside.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4117",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4118",234,"Now when Christopher was come to his place, he looked down and saw how","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4119",234,"the foemen were pouring over the river, for it was nowhere deep, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4120",234,"there were four quite shallow fords: many more were they than his folk,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4121",234,"but he deemed that they fared somewhat tumultuously; and when the bowmen","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4122",234,"of the Tofts began shooting, the foemen, a many of them, stayed amidst","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4123",234,"of the river to bend bow in their turn, and seemed to think that were","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4124",234,"nigh enough already; nay, some went back again to the other bank, to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4125",234,"shoot thence the surer and the drier, and some went yet a little further","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4126",234,"back on the field. So that when their sergeants and riders were come","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4127",234,"on to the hither bank, they lacked about a fifth of all their host;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4128",234,"and they themselves, for all they were so many, had some ado to make up","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4129",234,"their minds to go forward.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4130",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4131",234,"Forsooth, when they looked up to the bent and saw the three banners of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4132",234,"Oakenrealm and the Tofts and Brimside all waving over the same ranks,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4133",234,"they knew not what to make of it. And Christopher's host, when they saw","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4134",234,"them hang back, brake out into mocking whoops and shouts, and words were","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4135",234,"heard in them: ""Come and dine at Brimside, good fellows! Come up to the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4136",234,"Tofts for supper and bed! A Christopher! A Christopher!"" and so forth.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4137",234,"Now all King Christopher's men were afoot, saving a band of the riders","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4138",234,"of Brimside, who bestrode strong and tall horses, and bore jack and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4140",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4141",234,"So Christopher heard and saw, and the heart rose high in him, and he","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4142",234,"sent messengers to the right and the left, and bade the captains watch","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4143",234,"till he waved his sword aloft, and then all down the bent together; and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4144",234,"he bade the Brimside riders edge a little outward and downward, and be","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4145",234,"ready for the chase, and suffer not any of the foemen to gather together","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4146",234,"when once they fell to running; for he knew in his heart that the folk","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4147",234,"before him would never abide their onfall. And the day was yet young,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4148",234,"and it lacked four hours of noon.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4149",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4150",234,"King Christopher abode ill he saw the foemen were come off the level","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4151",234,"ground, and were mounting the bent slowly, and not in very good order","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4152",234,"or in ranks closely serried. Then he strode forth three paces, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4153",234,"waved his sword high above his head, and cried out: ""A Christopher! A","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4154",234,"Christopher! Forward, banner of the Realm!"" And forth he went, steady","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4155",234,"and strong, and a great shout arose behind him, and none shrank or","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4156",234,"lagged, but spears and bills, and axes and swords, all came on like a","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4157",234,"wall of steel, so that to the foemen the earth seemed alive with death,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4158",234,"and they made no show of abiding the onset, but all turned and ran, save","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4159",234,"Walter the White and a score of his knights, who forsooth were borne","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4160",234,"down in a trice, and were taken to mercy, those of them who were not","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4161",234,"slain at the first crash of weapons.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4162",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4163",234,"There then ye might have seen great clumps of men making no defence, but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4164",234,"casting down their weapons and crying mercy; and forsooth so great was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4165",234,"the throng, that no great many were slain; but on the other hand, but","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4167",234,"riders, and hewed down and slew and took few to mercy. And some few","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4168",234,"besides the first laggards of the bowmen, it might be three hundreds in","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4169",234,"all, escaped, and gat to Woodwall, but when they of the town saw them,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4170",234,"they made up their minds speedily, and shut their gates, and the poor","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4171",234,"fleers found but the points of shafts and the heads of quarrels before","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4173",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4174",234,"But on the field of deed those captives were somewhat fearful as to what","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4175",234,"should be done with them, and they spake one to the other about it, that","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4176",234,"they would be willing to serve the new King, since he was so mighty.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4177",234,"And amidst of their talk came the captains of King Christopher, and they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4178",234,"drew into a ring around them, and the lords bade them look to it whether","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4179",234,"they would be the foemen of the King, the son of that King Christopher","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4180",234,"the Old. ""If so ye be,"" said they, ""ye may escape this time; but ye see","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4181",234,"how valiant a man he is, and how lucky withal, and happy shall they be","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4182",234,"whom he calleth friends. Now what say ye, will ye take up your weapons","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4183",234,"again, and be under the best of kings and a true one, or will ye depart","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4184",234,"and take the chance of his wrath in the coming days? We say, how many of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4185",234,"you will serve King Christopher.""","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4186",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4187",234,"Then arose from them a mighty shout: ""All! All! One and All!"" Albeit","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4188",234,"some there were who slunk away and said nought; and none heeded them.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4189",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4190",234,"So then all the sergeants and the common folk swore allegiance to King","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4191",234,"Christopher; but of the knights who were left alive, some said Yea, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4192",234,"some Nay; and these last were suffered to depart, but must needs ride","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4194",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4195",234,"Now by the time all was done, and the new men had dined along with the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4196",234,"rest of the host, and of the new-comers tale had been taken, the day was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4197",234,"wearing; so they set off for Woodwall, and on the way they met the Mayor","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4198",234,"and Aldermen thereof, who came before King Christopher and knelt to him,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4199",234,"and gave him the keys of their town; so he was gracious to them, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4200",234,"thanked them, and bade see to the victual and lodging of the host, and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4201",234,"that all should be paid thereafter. And they said that they had seen to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4202",234,"all this before they came forth of the town, and that if the Lord King","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4203",234,"would ride forth, he would find fair lodging in the good town. So King","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4204",234,"Christopher was pleased, and bade the burgesses ride beside him, and he","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4205",234,"talked merrily with them on the way, so that their hearts rejoiced over","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4206",234,"the kindness of their lord.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4207",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4208",234,"So they came to the gate, and there the King made stay till Goldilind","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4209",234,"was fetched to him, so that they might ride into the good town side","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4210",234,"by side. And in the street was much people thronging, and the sun was","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4211",234,"scarce set, so that the folk could see their King and Queen what they","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4212",234,"were; and they who were nighest unto them, they let their shouts die","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4213",234,"out, so were their hearts touched with the sight of them and the love of","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4214",234,"their beauty.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4215",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4216",234,"Thus rode they in triumph through the street till they were come to","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4217",234,"their lodging, which was great and goodly as for a cheaping town; and so","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4218",234,"the day was gone and the night was come, and the council and the banquet","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4219",234,"were over; then were the King and Goldilind together again, like any","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4220",234,"up-country lad and lass. But she stood before him and said: ""O thou King","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4221",234,"and mighty warrior, surely I ought to fear thee now, but it is not so,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4222",234,"so sore as I desire thee; but yet it maketh both laughter and tears come","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4223",234,"to me when I think of the day we rode away from Greenharbour with thee,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4224",234,"and I seemed to myself a great lady, though I were unhappy; and though","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4225",234,"I loved thy body, I feared lest the churl's blood in thee might shame me","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4226",234,"perchance, and I was proud and unkind to thee, and I hurt thee sorely;","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4227",234,"and now I will say it, and confess, that somewhat I joyed to see thine","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4228",234,"anguish, for I knew that it meant thy love for me and thy desire to me.","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4230",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4231",234,"He laughed. ""Sweetling,"" he said, ""meseemeth now all day long I have","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4232",234,"been fighting against raiment rather than men; no man withstood me in","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4233",234,"the battle, for that they feared the crown on my helm and the banner","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4235",234,"how should I have known them from borrel folk but for their scarlet","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4247",234,"his kingly raiment was cast from him, and he took her by the hand and","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4257",234,"When morning was, and it was yet early, the town was all astir and the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4258",234,"gates were thrown open, and weaponed men thronged into it crying out for","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4259",234,"Christopher the King. Then the King came forth, and Jack o' the Tofts","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4260",234,"and his sons, and Oliver Marson, and the captains of Brimside; and the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4263",234,"were new captains appointed, and thereafter they tarried not save to eat","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4264",234,"a morsel, but went out a-gates faring after the banners to Oakenrealm,","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4278",234,"now in a somewhat perilous pass; for they must needs rest at a little","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4279",234,"thorpe amidst of great and thick woods, which lay all round about the","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4280",234,"frank of Oakenham as a garland about a head. So there they kept watch","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4281",234,"and ward more heedfully than their wont was; and King Christopher lodged","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4294",234,"over his steel hat, so that his face was hidden, and he had a bag in his","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4303",234,"","Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
