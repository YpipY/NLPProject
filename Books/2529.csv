"71",2529,"I find myself in sympathy, although at first sight they might seem","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"72",2529,"inconsistent. On the one hand, many psychologists, especially those","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"73",2529,"of the behaviourist school, tend to adopt what is essentially a","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"76",2529,"observation, and tend to think of matter as something much more solid","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"77",2529,"and indubitable than mind. Meanwhile the physicists, especially Einstein","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"79",2529,"""matter"" less and less material. Their world consists of ""events,"" from","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"81",2529,"example, Professor Eddington's ""Space, Time and Gravitation"" (Cambridge","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"83",2529,"receive no support from modern physics. I think that what has permanent","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"84",2529,"value in the outlook of the behaviourists is the feeling that physics is","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"85",2529,"the most fundamental science at present in existence. But this position","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3002",2529,"in order to make some observations on my own account with reference to","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3003",2529,"the above quotations from Stout. In the first place, the conception of","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3004",2529,"""psychical states"" seems to me one which demands analysis of a somewhat","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3005",2529,"destructive character. This analysis I shall give in later lectures as","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3006",2529,"regards cognition; I have already given it as regards desire. In the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3007",2529,"second place, the conception of ""objects"" depends upon a certain view","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3008",2529,"as to cognition which I believe to be wholly mistaken, namely, the view","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3009",2529,"which I discussed in my first lecture in connection with Brentano.","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3010",2529,"In this view a single cognitive occurrence contains both content and","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3011",2529,"object, the content being essentially mental, while the object is","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3012",2529,"physical except in introspection and abstract thought. I have already","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3013",2529,"criticized this view, and will not dwell upon it now, beyond saying","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3014",2529,"that ""the process by which objects are cognized"" appears to be a very","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3015",2529,"slippery phrase. When we ""see a table,"" as common sense would say, the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3016",2529,"table as a physical object is not the ""object"" (in the psychological","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3017",2529,"sense) of our perception. Our perception is made up of sensations,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3018",2529,"images and beliefs, but the supposed ""object"" is something inferential,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3019",2529,"externally related, not logically bound up with what is occurring in us.","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3020",2529,"This question of the nature of the object also affects the view we take","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3021",2529,"of self-consciousness. Obviously, a ""conscious experience"" is different","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3022",2529,"from a physical object; therefore it is natural to assume that a thought","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3023",2529,"or perception whose object is a conscious experience must be different","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3024",2529,"from a thought or perception whose object is a physical object. But if","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3025",2529,"the relation to the object is inferential and external, as I maintain,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3026",2529,"the difference between two thoughts may bear very little relation to","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3027",2529,"the difference between their objects. And to speak of ""the present","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3028",2529,"modification of the individual's consciousness by which an object is","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3029",2529,"cognized"" is to suggest that the cognition of objects is a far more","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3030",2529,"direct process, far more intimately bound up with the objects, than I","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3031",2529,"believe it to be. All these points will be amplified when we come to the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3036",2529,"Another point in which Stout's remarks seem to me to suggest what I","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3037",2529,"regard as mistakes is his use of ""consciousness."" There is a view which","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3038",2529,"is prevalent among psychologists, to the effect that one can speak of ""a","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3039",2529,"conscious experience"" in a curious dual sense, meaning, on the one hand,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3040",2529,"an experience which is conscious of something, and, on the other hand,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3041",2529,"an experience which has some intrinsic nature characteristic of what","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3043",2529,"characterized on the one hand by relation to its object and on the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3044",2529,"other hand by being composed of a certain peculiar stuff, the stuff of","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3047",2529,"which we are conscious. All these, it seems to me, need to be clearly","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3048",2529,"separated. To say that one occurrence is ""conscious"" of another is, to","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3801",2529,"experience are of the nature of sensations, we find more difficulty","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3802",2529,"than might have been expected. Prima facie, everything is sensation that","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3806",2529,"so much of habitual correlation, is mixed with all such experiences,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3807",2529,"that the core of pure sensation is only to be extracted by careful","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3808",2529,"investigation. To take a simple illustration: if you go to the theatre","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3809",2529,"in your own country, you seem to hear equally well in the stalls or the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3813",2529,"necessary to be much nearer the stage than you would need to be in your","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3814",2529,"own country. The reason is that, in hearing our own language spoken, we","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3815",2529,"quickly and unconsciously fill out what we really hear with inferences","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3816",2529,"to what the man must be saying, and we never realize that we have not","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3817",2529,"heard the words we have merely inferred. In a foreign language, these","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3818",2529,"inferences are more difficult, and we are more dependent upon actual","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3819",2529,"sensation. If we found ourselves in a foreign world, where tables looked","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3823",2529,"many of these things will seem to form part of the sensation. I remember","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3852",2529,"knowledge comes THROUGH the seeing, but I think it is a mistake to","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3853",2529,"regard the mere seeing itself as knowledge. If we are so to regard it,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3854",2529,"we must distinguish the seeing from what is seen: we must say that, when","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3855",2529,"we see a patch of colour of a certain shape, the patch of colour is one","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3857",2529,"admission of the subject, or act, in the sense discussed in our first","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3858",2529,"lecture. If there is a subject, it can have a relation to the patch of","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3859",2529,"colour, namely, the sort of relation which we might call awareness. In","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3860",2529,"that case the sensation, as a mental event, will consist of awareness of","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3861",2529,"the colour, while the colour itself will remain wholly physical, and","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3862",2529,"may be called the sense-datum, to distinguish it from the sensation.","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3863",2529,"The subject, however, appears to be a logical fiction, like mathematical","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3866",2529,"by grammar. Nominal entities of this sort may or may not exist, but","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3867",2529,"there is no good ground for assuming that they do. The functions that","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3870",2529,"are to avoid a perfectly gratuitous assumption, we must dispense with","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3871",2529,"the subject as one of the actual ingredients of the world. But when","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3872",2529,"we do this, the possibility of distinguishing the sensation from","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3873",2529,"the sense-datum vanishes; at least I see no way of preserving the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3874",2529,"distinction. Accordingly the sensation that we have when we see a patch","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3877",2529,"colour is certainly not knowledge, and therefore we cannot say that pure","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3878",2529,"sensation is cognitive. Through its psychological effects, it is the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3879",2529,"cause of cognitions, partly by being itself a sign of things that","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3880",2529,"are correlated with it, as e.g. sensations of sight and touch are","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"4666",2529,"There are, however, several points in which such an account of","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"4668",2529,"more correct to define recognition as ""I have seen this before"" than","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"4672",2529,"that there is anything substantial in this point. The definition of ""my","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"4700",2529,"name ""Jones."" What we see on any one occasion is not the whole series of","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4701",2529,"particulars that make up Jones, but only one of them (or a few in quick","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"4709",2529,"shall find a similar point as regards true memory; and in connection","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4710",2529,"with true memory we will consider the point again. It is sometimes","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4711",2529,"suggested, by those who favour behaviourist views, that recognition","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4712",2529,"consists in behaving in the same way when a stimulus is repeated as we","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4713",2529,"behaved on the first occasion when it occurred. This seems to be the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4714",2529,"exact opposite of the truth. The essence of recognition is in the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4715",2529,"DIFFERENCE between a repeated stimulus and a new one. On the first","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4716",2529,"occasion there is no recognition; on the second occasion there is. In","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4717",2529,"fact, recognition is another instance of the peculiarity of causal laws","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4718",2529,"in psychology, namely, that the causal unit is not a single event, but","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4719",2529,"two or more events Habit is the great instance of this, but recognition","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4720",2529,"is another. A stimulus occurring once has a certain effect; occurring","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"4721",2529,"twice, it has the further effect of recognition. Thus the phenomenon","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"8039",2529,"addition to our definition. A judgment of perception, we may say,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8040",2529,"consists of a core of sensation, together with associated images, with","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8041",2529,"belief in the present existence of an object to which sensation and","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8042",2529,"images are referred in a way which is difficult to analyse. Perhaps we","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8043",2529,"might say that the belief is not fundamentally in any PRESENT existence,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8044",2529,"but is of the nature of an expectation: for example, when we see an","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8045",2529,"object, we expect certain sensations to result if we proceed to touch","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8046",2529,"it. Perception, then, will consist of a present sensation together with","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8047",2529,"expectations of future sensations. (This, of course, is a reflective","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8048",2529,"analysis, not an account of the way perception appears to unchecked","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"8050",2529,"since they are based upon correlations which are usual but not","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"8052",2529,"for example, if we try to touch a reflection in a looking-glass under","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"8054",2529,"difficulty arises as regards consciousness of past objects. It would","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8055",2529,"seem odd to say that we can be ""conscious"" of a thing which does not or","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"8059",2529,"","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8060",2529,"In the second place, the question arises as to whether we can be","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8061",2529,"conscious of images. If we apply our definition to this case, it seems","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8062",2529,"to demand images of images. In order, for example, to be conscious of","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8063",2529,"an image of a cat, we shall require, according to the letter of the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8064",2529,"definition, an image which is a copy of our image of the cat, and has","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8065",2529,"this image for its prototype. Now, it hardly seems probable, as a matter","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8066",2529,"of observation, that there are images of images, as opposed to images","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8067",2529,"of sensations. We may meet this difficulty in two ways, either by boldly","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8068",2529,"denying consciousness of images, or by finding a sense in which, by","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8069",2529,"means of a different accompanying belief, an image, instead of meaning","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8070",2529,"its prototype, can mean another image of the same prototype.","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8071",2529,"","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8072",2529,"The first alternative, which denies consciousness of images, has already","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8073",2529,"been discussed when we were dealing with Introspection in Lecture VI. We","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8074",2529,"then decided that there must be, in some sense, consciousness of images.","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8075",2529,"We are therefore left with the second suggested way of dealing with","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8076",2529,"knowledge of images. According to this second hypothesis, there may be","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8077",2529,"two images of the same prototype, such that one of them means the other,","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8078",2529,"instead of meaning the prototype. It will be remembered that we defined","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8079",2529,"meaning by association a word or image means an object, we said, when it","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8080",2529,"has the same associations as the object. But this definition must not be","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8081",2529,"interpreted too absolutely: a word or image will not have ALL the","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8082",2529,"same associations as the object which it means. The word ""cat"" may","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8083",2529,"be associated with the word ""mat,"" but it would not happen except by","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8084",2529,"accident that a cat would be associated with a mat. And in like manner","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8085",2529,"an image may have certain associations which its prototype will not","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8086",2529,"have, e.g. an association with the word ""image."" When these associations","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"8091",2529,"example, when a place recalls to us some thought we previously had in","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"8092",2529,"that place, so that we remember a thought as opposed to the occurrence","The Analysis of Mind","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
