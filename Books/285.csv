"80",285,"satisfied my small ambition. The goatskins in which they were sewn up","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"89",285,"then as make a return journey all on purpose. So he took the crowbar,","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"90",285,"and I shouldered the rope, and away we went up to the ridge of the","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"92",285,"","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"93",285,"Of course these caves were not easy to come at, or else they would have","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"94",285,"been raided years before. Coppinger, who on principle makes out he","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"95",285,"knows all about these things, says that in the old Guanche days they","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"96",285,"had ladders of goatskin rope which they could pull up when they were at","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"97",285,"home, and so keep out undesirable callers; and as no other plan occurs","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"98",285,"to me, perhaps he may be right. Anyway the mouths of the caves were in","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"99",285,"a more or less level row thirty feet below the ridge of the cliff, and","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"104",285,"light knotted rope is easily carried, and though it would have been hard","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"105",285,"to climb up this, our plan was to descend on each cave mouth from above,","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"106",285,"and then slip down to the foot of the cliffs, and start again AB INITIO","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"110",285,"there is no getting over the fact that he is portly and nearer fifty","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"112",285,"I went first each time, and got into the cave mouth, and did what I","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"120",285,"I asked him to take them for granted, and save himself the rest. But","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"121",285,"he insisted on clambering down to each one in person, and as he decided","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"122",285,"that one of my granaries was a prison, and another a pot-making factory,","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"123",285,"and another a schoolroom for young priests, he naturally said he hadn't","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"128",285,"But as the day went on, and the sun rose higher, Coppinger began clearly","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"129",285,"to have had enough of it, though he was very game, and insisted on going","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"130",285,"on much longer than was safe. I must say I didn't like it. You see","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"131",285,"the drop was seldom less than eighty feet from the top of the cliffs.","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"132",285,"However, at last he was forced to give it up. I suggested marching off","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
"133",285,"to Santa Brigida forthwith, but he wouldn't do that. There were three","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"137",285,"a report solely from my untrained observation, but I flatly refused to","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"2875",285,"of the object I had in hand, I made no interruption.","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"2883",285,"sacrificed to a policy, and so as I say, I watched on, outwardly cold","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"2890",285,"struggle for her life, and to do vicious damage, it might be, before","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"

"2892",285,"Their wagers, and the hum of their appreciation, swept loudly round the","The Lost Continent","Hyne, Charles John Cutcliffe Wright","Science Fiction","en"
