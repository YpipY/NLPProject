"512",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"513",3800,"Extended substance, in so far as it is substance, consists,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"515",3800,"infinite, or consequently, that it can appertain to God.  This","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"516",3800,"they illustrate with many examples, of which I will take one or","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"517",3800,"two.  If extended substance, they say, is infinite, let it be","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"518",3800,"conceived to be divided into two parts; each part will then be","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"519",3800,"either finite or infinite.  If the former, then infinite","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"520",3800,"substance is composed of two finite parts, which is absurd.  If","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"557",3800,"notion of an infinite quantity, but merely from the notion that","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"558",3800,"an infinite quantity is measurable, and composed of finite parts","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"559",3800,"therefore, the only fair conclusion to be drawn is that:","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"560",3800,"infinite quantity is not measurable, and cannot be composed of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"561",3800,"finite parts.  This is exactly what we have already proved (in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1320",3800,"which might and may prove very grave hindrances to the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1321",3800,"understanding of the concatenation of things, as I have explained","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1323",3800,"misconceptions before the bar of reason.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1324",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1325",3800,"All such opinions spring from the notion commonly","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1326",3800,"entertained, that all things in nature act as men themselves act,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1327",3800,"namely, with an end in view.  It is accepted as certain, that God","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1328",3800,"himself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1329",3800,"that God made all things for man, and man that he might worship","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1330",3800,"him).  I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1331",3800,"why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1332",3800,"prone to adopt it? secondly, I will point out its falsity; and,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1333",3800,"lastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1334",3800,"good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1335",3800,"confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like.  However, this is","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1336",3800,"not the place to deduce these misconceptions from the nature of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1337",3800,"the human mind: it will be sufficient here, if I assume as a","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1338",3800,"starting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1339",3800,"that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things, that all","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1340",3800,"have the desire to seek for what is useful to them, and that they","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1341",3800,"are conscious of such desire.  Herefrom it follows, first, that","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1342",3800,"men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1343",3800,"volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1344",3800,"of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1345",3800,"Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1346",3800,"which is useful to them, and which they seek.  Thus it comes to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1347",3800,"pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1348",3800,"events, and when these are learned, they are content, as having","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1349",3800,"no cause for further doubt.  If they cannot learn such causes","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1350",3800,"from external sources, they are compelled to turn to considering","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1351",3800,"themselves, and reflecting what end would have induced them","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1352",3800,"personally to bring about the given event, and thus they","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1353",3800,"necessarily judge other natures by their own.  Further, as they","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1354",3800,"find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1355",3800,"them not a little in the search for what is useful, for instance,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1357",3800,"yielding food, the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1358",3800,"fish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a means","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1359",3800,"for obtaining such conveniences.  Now as they are aware, that","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1360",3800,"they found these conveniences and did not make them, they think","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1361",3800,"they have cause for believing, that some other being has made","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1362",3800,"them for their use.  As they look upon things as means, they","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1363",3800,"cannot believe them to be self--created; but, judging from the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1364",3800,"means which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves, they","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1365",3800,"are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1366",3800,"endowed with human freedom, who have arranged and adapted","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1370",3800,"the gods ordained everything for the use of man, in order to bind","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1371",3800,"man to themselves and obtain from him the highest honor.  Hence","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1372",3800,"also it follows, that everyone thought out for himself, according","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1375",3800,"of nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1376",3800,"insatiable avarice.  Thus the prejudice developed into","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1377",3800,"superstition, and took deep root in the human mind; and for this","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1378",3800,"reason everyone strove most zealously to understand and explain","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1381",3800,"man, they only seem to have demonstrated that nature, the gods,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1382",3800,"and men are all mad together.  Consider, I pray you, the result:","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1383",3800,"among the many helps of nature they were bound to find some","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1384",3800,"hindrances, such as storms, earthquakes, diseases, &c.: so they","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1385",3800,"declared that such things happen, because the gods are angry at","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1386",3800,"some wrong done to them by men, or at some fault committed in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1388",3800,"infinite examples, that good and evil fortunes fall to the lot of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1389",3800,"pious and impious alike; still they would not abandon their","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1406",3800,"no need to show at length, that nature has no particular goal in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1407",3800,"view, and that final causes are mere human figments.  This, I","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1408",3800,"think, is already evident enough, both from the causes and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1409",3800,"foundations on which I have shown such prejudice to be based, and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1410",3800,"also from Prop. xvi., and the Corollary of Prop. xxxii., and, in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1412",3800,"everything in nature proceeds from a sort of necessity, and with","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1413",3800,"the utmost perfection.  However, I will add a few remarks, in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1415",3800,"which is really a cause it considers as an effect, and vice versa:","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1417",3800,"which is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect.  Passing","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1418",3800,"over the questions of cause and priority as self--evident, it is","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1419",3800,"plain from Props. xxi., xxii., xxiii. that the effect is most","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1420",3800,"perfect which is produced immediately by God; the effect which","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1421",3800,"requires for its production several intermediate causes is, in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1430",3800,"distinction between the object of want and the object of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1432",3800,"the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation.  They are","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1433",3800,"unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1616",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1617",3800,"DEFINITION III. By idea, I mean the mental conception which is","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1619",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1676",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1677",3800,"Proof.--Particular thoughts, or this and that thought, are","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1678",3800,"modes which, in a certain conditioned manner, express the nature","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1685",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1686",3800,"Note.--This proposition is also evident from the fact, that we","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1687",3800,"are able to conceive an infinite thinking being.  For, in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1688",3800,"proportion as a thinking being is conceived as thinking more","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1689",3800,"thoughts, so is it conceived as containing more reality or","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1690",3800,"perfection.  Therefore a being, which can think an infinite","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1706",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1707",3800,"Proof.--God (by the first Prop. of this Part) can think an","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1716",3800,"will of God, and the right over all things that exist, which","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1717",3800,"latter are accordingly generally considered as contingent.  For","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1718",3800,"it is said that God has the power to destroy all things, and to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1719",3800,"reduce them to nothing.  Further, the power of God is very often","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1720",3800,"likened to the power of kings.  But this doctrine we have refuted","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1721",3800,"(Pt. i., Prop. xxxii., Corolls. i. and ii.), and we have shown","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1723",3800,"that by which he understands himself; in other words, as it","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1724",3800,"follows from the necessity of the divine nature (as all admit),","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1725",3800,"that God understands himself, so also does it follow by the same","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1726",3800,"necessity, that God performs infinite acts in infinite ways.  We","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1727",3800,"further showed (Part i., Prop. xxxiv.), that God's power is","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1728",3800,"identical with God's essence in action; therefore it is as","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1729",3800,"impossible for us to conceive God as not acting, as to conceive","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1730",3800,"him as non--existent.  If we might pursue the subject further, I","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1731",3800,"could point out, that the power which is commonly attributed to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1732",3800,"God is not only human (as showing that God is conceived by the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1733",3800,"multitude as a man, or in the likeness of a man), but involves a","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1734",3800,"negation of power.  However, I am unwilling to go over the same","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"2898",3800,"are derived the terms styled transcendental, such as Being,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"2899",3800,"Thing, Something.  These terms arose from the fact, that the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"2900",3800,"human body, being limited, is only capable of distinctly forming","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"2907",3800,"(from II. Prop. xvii. Coroll., and xviii.) that the human mind","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"2908",3800,"can distinctly imagine as many things simultaneously, as its body","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"2926",3800,"which all the individuals, in so far as the body is affected by","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"2929",3800,"by the name man, and this it predicates of an infinite number of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"2930",3800,"particular individuals.  For, as we have said, it is unable to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3030",3800,"the idea of an idea; but we may remark that the foregoing","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3031",3800,"proposition is in itself sufficiently plain.  No one, who has a","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3032",3800,"true idea, is ignorant that a true idea involves the highest","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3033",3800,"certainty.  For to have a true idea is only another expression","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3034",3800,"for knowing a thing perfectly, or as well as possible.  No one,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3035",3800,"indeed, can doubt of this, unless he thinks that an idea is","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3036",3800,"something lifeless, like a picture on a panel, and not a mode of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3037",3800,"thinking--namely, the very act of understanding.  And who, I ask,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3038",3800,"can know that he understands anything, unless he do first","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3041",3800,"there be more clear, and more certain, than a true idea as a","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3042",3800,"standard of truth?  Even as light displays both itself and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3052",3800,"it that men have false ideas?  Lastly, how can anyone be sure,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3053",3800,"that he has ideas which agree with their objects?  These","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3054",3800,"questions, I repeat, I have, in my opinion, sufficiently","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3063",3800,"pointed out, with abundant clearness, that his knowledge arises","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3200",3800,"that the lines drawn from the centre of a circle to its","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3201",3800,"circumference are not equal, he then, at all events, assuredly","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3203",3800,"assigned by mathematicians.  So again, when men make mistakes in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3267",3800,"involves the conception or idea of a triangle, that is, without","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3268",3800,"the idea of a triangle it cannot be conceived.  It is the same","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3269",3800,"thing to say, that the concept A must involve the concept B, as","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3270",3800,"it is to say, that A cannot be conceived without B.  Further,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3271",3800,"this affirmation cannot be made (II. Ax. iii.) without the idea","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3272",3800,"of a triangle.  Therefore, this affirmation can neither be nor be","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3273",3800,"conceived, without the idea of a triangle.  Again, this idea of a","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3279",3800,"besides.  What we have said of this volition (inasmuch as we have","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3290",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3291",3800,"Note.--We have thus removed the cause which is commonly","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3292",3800,"assigned for error.  For we have shown above, that falsity","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3293",3800,"consists solely in the privation of knowledge involved in ideas","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3294",3800,"which are fragmentary and confused.  Wherefore, a false idea,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3295",3800,"inasmuch as it is false, does not involve certainty.  When we","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3296",3800,"say, then, that a man acquiesces in what is false, and that he","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3297",3800,"has no doubts on the subject, we do not say that he is certain,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3298",3800,"but only that he does not doubt, or that he acquiesces in what is","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3299",3800,"false, inasmuch as there are no reasons, which should cause his","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3300",3800,"imagination to waver (see II. xliv. note).  Thus, although the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3301",3800,"man be assumed to acquiesce in what is false, we shall never say","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3302",3800,"that he is certain.  For by certainty we mean something positive","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3303",3800,"(II. xliii. and note), not merely the absence of doubt.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3304",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3305",3800,"However, in order that the foregoing proposition may be fully","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3306",3800,"explained, I will draw attention to a few additional points, and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3307",3800,"I will furthermore answer the objections which may be advanced","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3309",3800,"I have thought it worth while to point out some of the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3310",3800,"advantages, which follow therefrom.  I say ""some,"" for they will","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3311",3800,"be better appreciated from what we shall set forth in the fifth","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3312",3800,"part.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3313",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3314",3800,"I begin, then, with the first point, and warn my readers to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3315",3800,"make an accurate distinction between an idea, or conception of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3316",3800,"the mind, and the images of things which we imagine.  It is","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3317",3800,"further necessary that they should distinguish between idea and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3318",3800,"words, whereby we signify things.  These three--namely, images,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3319",3800,"words, and ideas--are by many persons either entirely confused","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3320",3800,"together, or not distinguished with sufficient accuracy or care,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3321",3800,"and hence people are generally in ignorance, how absolutely","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3322",3800,"necessary is a knowledge of this doctrine of the will, both for","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3323",3800,"philosophic purposes and for the wise ordering of life.  Those","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3324",3800,"who think that ideas consist in images which are formed in us by","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3325",3800,"contact with external bodies, persuade themselves that the ideas","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3326",3800,"of those things, whereof we can form no mental picture, are not","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3327",3800,"ideas, but only figments, which we invent by the free decree of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3328",3800,"our will; they thus regard ideas as though they were inanimate","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3329",3800,"pictures on a panel, and, filled with this misconception, do not","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3330",3800,"see that an idea, inasmuch as it is an idea, involves an","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3331",3800,"affirmation or negation.  Again, those who confuse words with","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3332",3800,"ideas, or with the affirmation which an idea involves, think that","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3333",3800,"they can wish something contrary to what they feel, affirm, or","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3334",3800,"deny.  This misconception will easily be laid aside by one, who","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3335",3800,"reflects on the nature of knowledge, and seeing that it in no","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3336",3800,"wise involves the conception of extension, will therefore clearly","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3337",3800,"understand, that an idea (being a mode of thinking) does not","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3338",3800,"consist in the image of anything, nor in words.  The essence of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3339",3800,"words and images is put together by bodily motions, which in no","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3340",3800,"wise involve the conception of thought.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3341",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3342",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3343",3800,"These few words on this subject will suffice: I will","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3344",3800,"therefore pass on to consider the objections, which may be raised","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3345",3800,"against our doctrine.  Of these, the first is advanced by those,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3346",3800,"who think that the will has a wider scope than the understanding,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3347",3800,"and that therefore it is different therefrom.  The reason for","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3348",3800,"their holding the belief, that the will has wider scope than the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3349",3800,"understanding, is that they assert, that they have no need of an","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3350",3800,"increase in their faculty of assent, that is of affirmation or","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3351",3800,"negation, in order to assent to an infinity of things which we do","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3352",3800,"not perceive, but that they have need of an increase in their","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3353",3800,"faculty of understanding.  The will is thus distinguished from","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3354",3800,"the intellect, the latter being finite and the former infinite.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3355",3800,"Secondly, it may be objected that experience seems to teach us","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3356",3800,"especially clearly, that we are able to suspend our judgment","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3357",3800,"before assenting to things which we perceive; this is confirmed","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3358",3800,"by the fact that no one is said to be deceived, in so far as he","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3359",3800,"perceives anything, but only in so far as he assents or dissents.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3360",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3361",3800,"For instance, he who feigns a winged horse, does not","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3362",3800,"therefore admit that a winged horse exists; that is, he is not","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3363",3800,"deceived, unless he admits in addition that a winged horse does","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3364",3800,"exist.  Nothing therefore seems to be taught more clearly by","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3365",3800,"experience, than that the will or faculty of assent is free and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3366",3800,"different from the faculty of understanding.  Thirdly, it may be","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3367",3800,"objected that one affirmation does not apparently contain more","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3368",3800,"reality than another; in other words, that we do not seem to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3369",3800,"need for affirming, that what is true is true, any greater power","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3370",3800,"than for affirming, that what is false is true.  We have,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3371",3800,"however, seen that one idea has more reality or perfection than","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3372",3800,"another, for as objects are some more excellent than others, so","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3373",3800,"also are the ideas of them some more excellent than others; this","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3374",3800,"also seems to point to a difference between the understanding and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3375",3800,"the will.  Fourthly, it may be objected, if man does not act from","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3376",3800,"free will, what will happen if the incentives to action are","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3377",3800,"equally balanced, as in the case of Buridan's ass?  Will he","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3378",3800,"perish of hunger and thirst?  If I say that he would, I shall","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3379",3800,"seem to have in my thoughts an ass or the statue of a man rather","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3380",3800,"than an actual man.  If I say that he would not, he would then","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3381",3800,"determine his own action, and would consequently possess the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3382",3800,"faculty of going and doing whatever he liked.  Other objections","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3383",3800,"might also be raised, but, as I am not bound to put in evidence","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3384",3800,"everything that anyone may dream, I will only set myself to the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3385",3800,"task of refuting those I have mentioned, and that as briefly as","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3386",3800,"possible.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3387",3800,"","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3388",3800,"To the first objection I answer, that I admit that the will","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3389",3800,"has a wider scope than the understanding, if by the understanding","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3390",3800,"be meant only clear and distinct ideas; but I deny that the will","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3391",3800,"has a wider scope than the perceptions, and the faculty of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3392",3800,"forming conceptions; nor do I see why the faculty of volition","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3393",3800,"should be called infinite, any more than the faculty of feeling:","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3394",3800,"for, as we are able by the same faculty of volition to affirm an","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3395",3800,"infinite number of things (one after the other, for we cannot","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3396",3800,"affirm an infinite number simultaneously), so also can we, by the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3397",3800,"same faculty of feeling, feel or perceive (in succession) an","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3398",3800,"infinite number of bodies.  If it be said that there is an","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3399",3800,"infinite number of things which we cannot perceive, I answer,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3400",3800,"that we cannot attain to such things by any thinking, nor,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"3401",3800,"consequently, by any faculty of volition.  But, it may still be","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3815",3800,"Again, it is not within the free power of the mind to remember or","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"3820",3800,"do not speak, or, if we do, it is by a spontaneous motion of the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"6096",3800,"But if a man sees a work, the like whereof he has never seen","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6097",3800,"before, and if he knows not the intention of the artificer, he","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6098",3800,"plainly cannot know, whether that work be perfect or imperfect.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"6104",3800,"which he saw agree with the general idea he had formed of the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"6106",3800,"less with his own preconceived type, even though it had evidently","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6107",3800,"been completed in accordance with the idea of its artificer.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6108",3800,"This seems to be the only reason for calling natural phenomena,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6109",3800,"which, indeed, are not made with human hands, perfect or","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6110",3800,"imperfect: for men are wont to form general ideas of things","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"6112",3800,"hold as types, believing that Nature (who they think does nothing","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6113",3800,"without an object) has them in view, and has set them as types","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6114",3800,"before herself.  Therefore, when they behold something in Nature,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6115",3800,"which does not wholly conform to the preconceived type which they","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"6122",3800,"Now we showed in the Appendix to Part I., that Nature does","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6123",3800,"not work with an end in view.  For the eternal and infinite","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6124",3800,"Being, which we call God or Nature, acts by the same necessity as","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6125",3800,"that whereby it exists.  For we have shown, that by the same","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6126",3800,"necessity of its nature, whereby it exists, it likewise works (I.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6127",3800,"xvi.).  The reason or cause why God or Nature exists, and the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6128",3800,"reason why he acts, are one and the same.  Therefore, as he does","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6129",3800,"not exist for the sake of an end, so neither does he act for the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6130",3800,"sake of an end; of his existence and of his action there is","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6131",3800,"neither origin nor end.  Wherefore, a cause which is called final","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"6132",3800,"is nothing else but human desire, in so far as it is considered","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"8530",3800,"more powerful the wise man is than the ignorant.  It is no part","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8531",3800,"of my design to point out the method and means whereby the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8532",3800,"understanding may be perfected, nor to show the skill whereby the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8533",3800,"body may be so tended, as to be capable of the due performance of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8534",3800,"its functions.  The latter question lies in the province of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8535",3800,"Medicine, the former in the province of Logic.  Here, therefore,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8536",3800,"I repeat, I shall treat only of the power of the mind, or of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8537",3800,"reason; and I shall mainly show the extent and nature of its","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8538",3800,"dominion over the emotions, for their control and moderation.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8539",3800,"That we do not possess absolute dominion over them, I have","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8540",3800,"already shown.  Yet the Stoics have thought, that the emotions","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8541",3800,"depended absolutely on our will, and that we could absolutely","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8542",3800,"govern them.  But these philosophers were compelled, by the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8543",3800,"protest of experience, not from their own principles, to confess,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8544",3800,"that no slight practice and zeal is needed to control and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8545",3800,"moderate them: and this someone endeavoured to illustrate by the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8546",3800,"example (if I remember rightly) of two dogs, the one a house--dog","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8547",3800,"and the other a hunting--dog.  For by long training it could be","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8548",3800,"brought about, that the house--dog should become accustomed to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8549",3800,"hunt, and the hunting--dog to cease from running after hares.  To","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8550",3800,"this opinion Descartes not a little inclines.  For he maintained,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8551",3800,"that the soul or mind is specially united to a particular part of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8552",3800,"the brain, namely, to that part called the pineal gland, by the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8553",3800,"aid of which the mind is enabled to feel all the movements which","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8554",3800,"are set going in the body, and also external objects, and which","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8555",3800,"the mind by a simple act of volition can put in motion in various","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8556",3800,"ways.  He asserted, that this gland is so suspended in the midst","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8557",3800,"of the brain, that it could be moved by the slightest motion of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8558",3800,"the animal spirits: further, that this gland is suspended in the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8559",3800,"midst of the brain in as many different manners, as the animal","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8560",3800,"spirits can impinge thereon; and, again, that as many different","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8561",3800,"marks are impressed on the said gland, as there are different","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8562",3800,"external objects which impel the animal spirits towards it;","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8563",3800,"whence it follows, that if the will of the soul suspends the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8564",3800,"gland in a position, wherein it has already been suspended once","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8565",3800,"before by the animal spirits driven in one way or another, the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8566",3800,"gland in its turn reacts on the said spirits, driving and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8567",3800,"determining them to the condition wherein they were, when","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8568",3800,"repulsed before by a similar position of the gland.  He further","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8569",3800,"asserted, that every act of mental volition is united in nature","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8570",3800,"to a certain given motion of the gland.  For instance, whenever","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8571",3800,"anyone desires to look at a remote object, the act of volition","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8572",3800,"causes the pupil of the eye to dilate, whereas, if the person in","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8573",3800,"question had only thought of the dilatation of the pupil, the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8574",3800,"mere wish to dilate it would not have brought about the result,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8575",3800,"inasmuch as the motion of the gland, which serves to impel the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8576",3800,"animal spirits towards the optic nerve in a way which would","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8577",3800,"dilate or contract the pupil, is not associated in nature with","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8578",3800,"the wish to dilate or contract the pupil, but with the wish to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8579",3800,"look at remote or very near objects.  Lastly, he maintained that,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8580",3800,"although every motion of the aforesaid gland seems to have been","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8581",3800,"united by nature to one particular thought out of the whole","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8582",3800,"number of our thoughts from the very beginning of our life, yet","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8583",3800,"it can nevertheless become through habituation associated with","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8584",3800,"other thoughts; this he endeavours to prove in the Passions de","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8585",3800,"l'ame, I.50.  He thence concludes, that there is no soul so weak,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8586",3800,"that it cannot, under proper direction, acquire absolute power","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8587",3800,"over its passions.  For passions as defined by him are","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8588",3800,"""perceptions, or feelings, or disturbances of the soul, which are","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8589",3800,"referred to the soul as species, and which (mark the expression)","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"8591",3800,"of the spirits."" (Passions de l'ame, I.27).  But, seeing that we","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8592",3800,"can join any motion of the gland, or consequently of the spirits,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8593",3800,"to any volition, the determination of the will depends entirely","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8594",3800,"on our own powers; if, therefore, we determine our will with","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8595",3800,"sure and firm decisions in the direction to which we wish our","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8596",3800,"actions to tend, and associate the motions of the passions which","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8597",3800,"we wish to acquire with the said decisions, we shall acquire an","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8598",3800,"absolute dominion over our passions.  Such is the doctrine of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8599",3800,"this illustrious philosopher (in so far as I gather it from his","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8600",3800,"own words); it is one which, had it been less ingenious, I could","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8601",3800,"hardly believe to have proceeded from so great a man.  Indeed, I","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8602",3800,"am lost in wonder, that a philosopher, who had stoutly asserted,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8603",3800,"that he would draw no conclusions which do not follow from","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8604",3800,"self--evident premisses, and would affirm nothing which he did not","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8605",3800,"clearly and distinctly perceive, and who had so often taken to","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8606",3800,"task the scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8607",3800,"occult qualities, could maintain a hypothesis, beside which","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8608",3800,"occult qualities are commonplace.  What does he understand, I","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8609",3800,"ask, by the union of the mind and the body? What clear and","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8610",3800,"distinct conception has he got of thought in most intimate union","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8611",3800,"with a certain particle of extended matter? Truly I should like","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8612",3800,"him to explain this union through its proximate cause.  But he","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8613",3800,"had so distinct a conception of mind being distinct from body,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8614",3800,"that he could not assign any particular cause of the union","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8615",3800,"between the two, or of the mind itself, but was obliged to have","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8616",3800,"recourse to the cause of the whole universe, that is to God.","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8617",3800,"Further, I should much like to know, what degree of motion the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8618",3800,"mind can impart to this pineal gland, and with what force can it","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8619",3800,"hold it suspended? For I am in ignorance, whether this gland can","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8620",3800,"be agitated more slowly or more quickly by the mind than by the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8621",3800,"animal spirits, and whether the motions of the passions, which we","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8622",3800,"have closely united with firm decisions, cannot be again","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8623",3800,"disjoined therefrom by physical causes; in which case it would","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8624",3800,"follow that, although the mind firmly intended to face a given","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8625",3800,"danger, and had united to this decision the motions of boldness,","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8626",3800,"yet at the sight of the danger the gland might become suspended","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8627",3800,"in a way, which would preclude the mind thinking of anything","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8628",3800,"except running away.  In truth, as there is no common standard of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8629",3800,"volition and motion, so is there no comparison possible between","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8630",3800,"the powers of the mind and the power or strength of the body;","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8631",3800,"consequently the strength of one cannot in any wise be determined","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8632",3800,"by the strength of the other.  We may also add, that there is no","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8633",3800,"gland discoverable in the midst of the brain, so placed that it","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8634",3800,"can thus easily be set in motion in so many ways, and also that","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8635",3800,"all the nerves are not prolonged so far as the cavities of the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8636",3800,"brain.  Lastly, I omit all the assertions which he makes","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8637",3800,"concerning the will and its freedom, inasmuch as I have","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8638",3800,"abundantly proved that his premisses are false.  Therefore, since","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8639",3800,"the power of the mind, as I have shown above, is defined by the","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"8640",3800,"understanding only, we shall determine solely by the knowledge of","Ethics","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
