"3470",4280,"is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitude and unity","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"3471",4280,"exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite). Or, if I","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"3537",4280,"cognition of an object, there is unity of conception, which may be","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"3538",4280,"called qualitative unity, so far as by this term we understand only the","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"3539",4280,"unity in our connection of the manifold; for example, unity of the theme","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"3541",4280,"of the deductions from it. The more true deductions we have from a given","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"3542",4280,"conception, the more criteria of its objective reality. This we might","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"3543",4280,"call the qualitative plurality of characteristic marks, which belong","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"3545",4280,"quantity in it. Thirdly, there is perfection--which consists in this,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"3546",4280,"that the plurality falls back upon the unity of the conception, and","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6356",4280,"themselves, without regard to the representations through which they","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6357",4280,"affect us, is utterly beyond the sphere of our cognition. Now although","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6359",4280,"thing given to us to be cognized, it is my duty to show what sort of","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6360",4280,"connection in time belongs to the manifold in phenomena themselves,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6361",4280,"while the representation of this manifold in apprehension is always","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6362",4280,"successive. For example, the apprehension of the manifold in the","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6363",4280,"phenomenon of a house which stands before me, is successive. Now","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6364",4280,"comes the question whether the manifold of this house is in itself","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6365",4280,"successive--which no one will be at all willing to grant. But, so","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6366",4280,"soon as I raise my conception of an object to the transcendental","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6367",4280,"signification thereof, I find that the house is not a thing in itself,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6368",4280,"but only a phenomenon, that is, a representation, the transcendental","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6370",4280,"by the question: ""How can the manifold be connected in the phenomenon","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6371",4280,"itself--not considered as a thing in itself, but merely as a","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6372",4280,"phenomenon?"" Here that which lies in my successive apprehension is","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6373",4280,"regarded as representation, whilst the phenomenon which is given","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6374",4280,"me, notwithstanding that it is nothing more than a complex of these","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6375",4280,"representations, is regarded as the object thereof, with which my","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6376",4280,"conception, drawn from the representations of apprehension, must","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6377",4280,"harmonize. It is very soon seen that, as accordance of the cognition","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6378",4280,"with its object constitutes truth, the question now before us can","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6379",4280,"only relate to the formal conditions of empirical truth; and that the","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6380",4280,"phenomenon, in opposition to the representations of apprehension, can","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6381",4280,"only be distinguished therefrom as the object of them, if it is subject","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6382",4280,"to a rule which distinguishes it from every other apprehension, and","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6383",4280,"which renders necessary a mode of connection of the manifold. That in","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6384",4280,"the phenomenon which contains the condition of this necessary rule of","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6385",4280,"apprehension, is the object.","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6386",4280,"","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6387",4280,"Let us now proceed to our task. That something happens, that is to say,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6388",4280,"that something or some state exists which before was not, cannot be","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6389",4280,"empirically perceived, unless a phenomenon precedes, which does not","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6390",4280,"contain in itself this state. For a reality which should follow upon","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6391",4280,"a void time, in other words, a beginning, which no state of things","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6392",4280,"precedes, can just as little be apprehended as the void time itself.","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6393",4280,"Every apprehension of an event is therefore a perception which follows","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6394",4280,"upon another perception. But as this is the case with all synthesis","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6395",4280,"of apprehension, as I have shown above in the example of a house, my","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6396",4280,"apprehension of an event is not yet sufficiently distinguished from","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6397",4280,"other apprehensions. But I remark also that if in a phenomenon which","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6398",4280,"contains an occurrence, I call the antecedent state of my perception,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6399",4280,"A, and the following state, B, the perception B can only follow A in","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6400",4280,"apprehension, and the perception A cannot follow B, but only precede","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6401",4280,"it. For example, I see a ship float down the stream of a river. My","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6402",4280,"perception of its place lower down follows upon my perception of its","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6403",4280,"place higher up the course of the river, and it is impossible that,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6404",4280,"in the apprehension of this phenomenon, the vessel should be perceived","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6405",4280,"first below and afterwards higher up the stream. Here, therefore, the","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6406",4280,"order in the sequence of perceptions in apprehension is determined;","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6407",4280,"and by this order apprehension is regulated. In the former example, my","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6408",4280,"perceptions in the apprehension of a house might begin at the roof and","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6409",4280,"end at the foundation, or vice versa; or I might apprehend the manifold","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6410",4280,"in this empirical intuition, by going from left to right, and from right","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6411",4280,"to left. Accordingly, in the series of these perceptions, there was no","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6412",4280,"determined order, which necessitated my beginning at a certain point, in","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6413",4280,"order empirically to connect the manifold. But this rule is always to be","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6414",4280,"met with in the perception of that which happens, and it makes the order","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6415",4280,"of the successive perceptions in the apprehension of such a phenomenon","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6416",4280,"necessary.","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6417",4280,"","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6418",4280,"I must, therefore, in the present case, deduce the subjective sequence","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6419",4280,"of apprehension from the objective sequence of phenomena, for","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6420",4280,"otherwise the former is quite undetermined, and one phenomenon is not","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6422",4280,"connection of the manifold in an object, for it is quite arbitrary.","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6423",4280,"The latter must consist in the order of the manifold in a phenomenon,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6426",4280,"with a rule. In this way alone can I be authorized to say of the","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6427",4280,"phenomenon itself, and not merely of my own apprehension, that a certain","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6428",4280,"order or sequence is to be found therein. That is, in other words, I","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6430",4280,"","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6433",4280,"which in this event follows always and necessarily; but I cannot reverse","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6434",4280,"this and go back from the event, and determine (by apprehension) that","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6435",4280,"which antecedes it. For no phenomenon goes back from the succeeding","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6436",4280,"point of time to the preceding point, although it does certainly relate","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6437",4280,"to a preceding point of time; from a given time, on the other hand,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6438",4280,"there is always a necessary progression to the determined succeeding","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6439",4280,"time. Therefore, because there certainly is something that follows, I","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6441",4280,"upon which it follows, in conformity with a rule, that is necessarily,","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6442",4280,"so that the event, as conditioned, affords certain indication of a","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6443",4280,"condition, and this condition determines the event.","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"

"6449",4280,"thing ought to precede, and what ought to follow in perception. In such","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6450",4280,"a case, we should have nothing but a play of representations, which","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6451",4280,"would possess no application to any object. That is to say, it would","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6452",4280,"not be possible through perception to distinguish one phenomenon from","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
"6453",4280,"another, as regards relations of time; because the succession in the act","The Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Immanuel","Philosophy","en"
