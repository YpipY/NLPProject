"211",4282,"evening and the light was fading away, he went to an inn and drew his","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"212",4282,"sword in the twilight and knocked with the hilt of it on the oaken","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"276",4282,"fastness of some great family of former times which had fallen on evil","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"295",4282,"appeared an ephemeral thing devoid of grace or dignity or tradition.","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"301",4282,"He accepted his accommodation with a nod; as indeed he would have","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"302",4282,"accepted any room in that inn, for the young are swift judges of","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"304",4282,"fault with rats or the profusion of giant cobwebs, dark with the dust","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"305",4282,"of years, that added so much to the dimness of that sinister inn. They","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"306",4282,"turned now and went back, in the wake of that guttering candle, till","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"307",4282,"they came again to the humbler part of the building. Here mine host,","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"308",4282,"pushing open a door of blackened oak, indicated his dining-chamber.","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"309",4282,"There a long table stood, and on it parts of the head and hams of a","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"310",4282,"boar; and at the far end of the table a plump and sturdy man was seated","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"311",4282,"in shirt-sleeves feasting himself on the boar's meat. He leaped up at","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"312",4282,"once from his chair as soon as his master entered, for he was the","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"313",4282,"servant at the Dragon and Knight; mine host may have said much to him","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"314",4282,"with a flash of his eyes, but he said no more with his tongue than the","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"315",4282,"one word, ""Dog"": he then bowed himself out, leaving Rodriguez to take","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"316",4282,"the only chair and to be waited upon by its recent possessor. The","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"317",4282,"boar's meat was cold and gnarled, another piece of meat stood on a","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"318",4282,"plate on a shelf and a loaf of bread near by, but the rats had had most","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"319",4282,"of the bread: Rodriguez demanded what the meat was. ""Unicorn's tongue,""","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"320",4282,"said the servant, and Rodriguez bade him set the dish before him, and","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"322",4282,"horse: it was a credulous age, as all ages are. At the same time he","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"323",4282,"pointed to a three-legged stool that he perceived in a corner of the","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"325",4282,"servant, who perceived that he was permitted to return to his feast, to","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"326",4282,"which he ran with alacrity. ""Your name?"" said Rodriguez as soon as both","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"329",4282,"merely give the reader the gist of his answer, for he added Spanish","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"330",4282,"words that correspond in our depraved and decadent language of to-day","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"331",4282,"to such words as ""top dog,"" ""nut"" and ""boss,"" so that his speech had a","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"350",4282,"mandolin into the wide world, for he had much shrewd sense. He never","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"351",4282,"pressed a point, but when something had been said that might mean much","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"352",4282,"he preferred to store it, as it were, in his mind and pass on to other","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"353",4282,"things, somewhat as one might kill game and pass on and kill more and","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"354",4282,"bring it all home, while a savage would cook the first kill where it","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"356",4282,"you may perhaps have exclaimed, ""That is not the way to treat one you","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"363",4282,"ridiculous, exquisite work went without saying; and as the rings were","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"364",4282,"slender they were of little value. Rodriguez made no comment upon the","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"365",4282,"rings; it was enough for him to have noticed them. He merely noted that","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"366",4282,"they were not ladies' rings, for no lady's ring would have fitted on to","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"368",4282,"given to Morano by their owners, for whoever wore precious stone needed","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"369",4282,"a ring to wear it in, and rings did not wear out like hose, which a","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"370",4282,"gallant might give to a servant. Nor, thought he, had Morano stolen","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"371",4282,"them, for whoever stole them would keep them whole, or part with them","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"5100",4282,"unwrapped his mandolin and played, reclining in the boat while he","Don Rodriguez; Chronicles of Shadow Valley","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
