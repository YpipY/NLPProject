"73",4391,"philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"80",4391,"so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"81",4391,"called philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"82",4391,"those first causes which are called PRINCIPLES. Now these principles","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"83",4391,"must possess TWO CONDITIONS: in the first place, they must be so","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"84",4391,"clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"86",4391,"knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"87",4391,"though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"91",4391,"depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"99",4391,"I should, in the next place, have proposed to consider the utility","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"100",4391,"of philosophy, and at the same time have shown that, since it","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"105",4391,"that to contain true philosophers is the highest privilege a state","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"107",4391,"individuals, it is not only useful for each man to have intercourse","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"108",4391,"with those who apply themselves to this study, but that it is","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"266",4391,"them; for it is only these two conditions that are required in true","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"267",4391,"principles. But I easily prove that they are very clear; firstly, by","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"268",4391,"a reference to the manner in which I found them, namely, by","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"270",4391,"is certain that such as could not be rejected by this test when they","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"271",4391,"were attentively considered, are the most evident and clear which","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"272",4391,"the human mind can know. Thus by considering that he who strives to","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"273",4391,"doubt of all is unable nevertheless to doubt that he is while he","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"274",4391,"doubts, and that what reasons thus, in not being able to doubt of","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"276",4391,"which we call our body, but what we name our mind or thought, I have","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"278",4391,"which I very clearly deduced the following truths, namely, that","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"288",4391,"of ways. Such are in sum the principles from which I deduce all","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"289",4391,"other truths. The second circumstance that proves the clearness of","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"410",4391,"published, some ten or twelve years ago, certain Essays on the","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"411",4391,"doctrines I thought I had acquired. The first part of these Essays","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"412",4391,"was a ""Discourse on the Method of rightly conducting the Reason, and","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"421",4391,"which I there gave an explanation, is one of the most difficult that","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"440",4391,"may be called the First Philosophy, or Metaphysics. That this part,","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"441",4391,"accordingly, may be properly understood, it will be necessary to","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"442",4391,"read beforehand the book of Meditations I wrote on the same subject.","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"443",4391,"The other three parts contain all that is most general in Physics,","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"444",4391,"namely, the explication of the first laws or principles of nature,","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"452",4391,"of the whole of philosophy, without omitting any of the matters that","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"453",4391,"ought to precede the last which I discussed. But to bring this","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"472",4391,"Meanwhile, that it may be seen wherein I think I have already","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"473",4391,"promoted the general good, I will here mention the fruits that may","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"474",4391,"be gathered from my Principles. The first is the satisfaction which","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"475",4391,"the mind will experience on finding in the work many truths before","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"477",4391,"our imagination as falsity and fiction, because it seems less","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"478",4391,"wonderful and is more simple, yet the gratification it affords is","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"479",4391,"always more durable and solid. The second fruit is, that in studying","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"480",4391,"these principles we will become accustomed by degrees to judge","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"481",4391,"better of all the things we come in contact with, and thus be made","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"482",4391,"wiser, in which respect the effect will be quite the opposite of the","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"483",4391,"common philosophy, for we may easily remark in those we call pedants","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"484",4391,"that it renders them less capable of rightly exercising their reason","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"485",4391,"than they would have been if they had never known it. The third is,","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"486",4391,"that the truths which they contain, being highly clear and certain,","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"487",4391,"will take away all ground of dispute, and thus dispose men's minds","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"2094",4391,"rarefied and condensed that, when rarefied, they have greater","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"

"2096",4391,"a degree as to make a distinction between the substance of body and","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"2097",4391,"its quantity, and between quantity itself and extension. The second","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
"2098",4391,"cause is this, that where we conceive only extension in length,","Selections from the Principles of Philosophy","Descartes, René","Philosophy","en"
