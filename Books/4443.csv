"2507",4443,"Italy. Unto him solely did Barto Rizzo yield thorough adhesion. He being","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2508",4443,"absent from Milan, Barto undertook to represent him and carry out his","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2510",4443,"that, on the ground of his general contempt for women, he objected to","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2511",4443,"the proposition that Vittoria should give the signal. The proposition","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2512",4443,"was Agostino's. Count Medole, Barto, and Agostino discussed it secretly:","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2522",4443,"be a dangerous place for them;--and that she should write it on paper","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2524",4443,"reading of her, open to the alternative charges of imbecility or of","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2525",4443,"treachery. Her letter to the English lady, the Austrian officer's","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2526",4443,"sister, was an exaggeration of the offence, but lent it more the look","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2527",4443,"of heedless folly. The point was to obtain sight of her letter to the","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2528",4443,"Austrian officer himself. Barto was baffled during a course of anxious","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2536",4443,"oh! and ah! coming frequently from his mouth; that he stood square while","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2547",4443,"both. Falling into a deep reflection, Barto counted over his hours of","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2548",4443,"conspiracy: he counted the Chief's; comparing the two sets of figures he","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2549",4443,"discovered, that as he had suspected, he was the elder in the patriotic","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2552",4443,"was on the spot: the Chief was absent. Barto reasoned that the Chief","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2553",4443,"could have had no experience of women, seeing that he was ready to trust","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2554",4443,"in them. ""Do I trust to my pigeon, my sling-stone?"" he said jovially to","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2555",4443,"the thickbrowed, splendidly ruddy young woman, who was his wife; ""do I","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2557",4443,"of remarkable personal attractions, served him with the fidelity of a","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2558",4443,"fascinated animal, and the dumbness of a wooden vessel. She could have","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2559",4443,"hanged him, had it pleased her. She had all his secrets: but it was not","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2560",4443,"vain speaking on Barto Rizzo's part; he was master of her will; and on","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2600",4443,"out his own name with brown-faced laughter in the bustling street. Luigi","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2601",4443,"was so impressed by his cunning and his recklessness that he at once","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2602",4443,"told him more than he wished to tell:--The Austrian officer was with his","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2603",4443,"sister, and had written to the signorina, and Luigi had delivered the","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2604",4443,"letter; but the signorina was at the maestro's, Rocco Ricci's, and there","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2605",4443,"was no answer: the officer was leaving for Verona in the morning. After","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2606",4443,"telling so much, Luigi drew back, feeling that he had given Barto his","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2607",4443,"full measure and owed to the signorina what remained.","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2608",4443,"","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2609",4443,"Barto probably read nothing of the mind of his spy, but understood that","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2611",4443,"the house of one Zotti, a confectioner, dwelling between the Duomo and","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2613",4443,"call for the signorina's answer to a certain letter about sunrise. ""I","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2618",4443,"in the square of the Duomo by sunrise, and slipped from his hold; the","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2619",4443,"officer ran after him some distance. ""She can't say I was false to her","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2620",4443,"now,"" said Luigi, dancing with nervous ecstasy. At sunrise Barto Rizzo","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2622",4443,"to Zotti's house, where the letter was placed in his hand, and the","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"2628",4443,"challenged Luigi to give up the letter, which was very plainly being","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2629",4443,"thrust from his hand into his breast. The officer found it no difficult","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2630",4443,"matter to catch him and pluck the letter from him; he opened it, reading","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2631",4443,"it on the jog of the saddle as he cantered off. Luigi turned in a terror","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2632",4443,"of expostulation to ward Barto's wrath. Barto looked at him hard, while","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"2633",4443,"he noted the matter down on the tablet of an ivory book. All he","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"5837",4443,"rubbish of brick, and tore them on six teeth of a saw that had been","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"5841",4443,"perceived that a stripped ivy-twig, with the leaves scattered around it,","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"5842",4443,"stretched at his feet. That was another and corroborative sign, clearer","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"5843",4443,"to him than printed capitals. The reading of it declared that the Revolt","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"5844",4443,"had collapsed. He wound and unwound his handkerchief about his fingers","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"5845",4443,"mechanically: great curses were in his throat. 'I would start for South","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"5851",4443,"knee when Eugene rushed up to him and kissed him.) Carlo was of this","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"5852",4443,"blood. Englishmen will hardly forgive him for having tears in his eyes,","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"5863",4443,"was far more wonderful, directing it so that he drew forth a packet of","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"6947",4443,"they trembled! Ammiani looked at his hand: no force of his will could","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6948",4443,"arrest its palsy. The Guidascarpi were sons of Bologna. The stupidity","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"6951",4443,"the waiter, and said, 'Tell me what place has bred those two fellows on","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"6953",4443,"reply was, 'Neapolitans.' The waiter was ready to make an additional","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6954",4443,"remark, but Ammiani nodded and communed with a toothpick. He was sure","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6955",4443,"that those Neapolitans were recruits of the Bolognese Polizia; on","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6956",4443,"the track of the Guidascarpi, possibly. As he was not unlike Angelo","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6957",4443,"Guidascarpi in figure, he became uneasy lest they should blunder 'twixt","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6958",4443,"him and La Scala; and the notion of any human power stopping him short","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6959",4443,"of that destination, made Ammiani's hand perfectly firm. He drew on his","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6960",4443,"gloves, and named the place whither he was going, aloud. 'Excellency,'","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6961",4443,"said the waiter, while taking up and pretending to reckon the money for","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6962",4443,"the bill: 'they have asked me whether there are two Counts Ammiani in","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"6994",4443,"that Vittoria would appear. From the blank aspect of the curtain he","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"6995",4443,"turned to the house, which was crowding fast, and was not like listless","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"7003",4443,"with expectation, hushing the usual noisy chatter, and setting a","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"7035",4443,"satisfied that she was understood, but opening the door of the box,","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"7036",4443,"passed in, and returned a stately acknowledgement of the salutations of","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"9590",4443,"Angelo had been careful to tie up his clothes in a bundle; there was","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"9592",4443,"terrible weapon near his hand, and a look in his eyes of wary indolence","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"9596",4443,"a lesson, 'I have taken a liking to your company. Here, come here; I","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"12747",4443,"brought their meals irregularly, and she would never open her lips: she","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"12748",4443,"was like a guardian of the tombs. Wilfrid abandoned his dream of the","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"12791",4443,"paroxysm in the effort to conceal his abject horror. Rinaldo sat by his","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"12995",4443,"of surgent hosts, and the muffled voluming and crash of storm-bells,","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"12996",4443,"proclaimed that the insurrection was hot. A rout of peasants bearing","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"12997",4443,"immense ladders met them, and they joined with cheers, and rushed to","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"13018",4443,"challenges and mounting the endless piles of stones, he sat down at the","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"13019",4443,"head of the Corso di Porta Nuova, and took refreshments from the hands","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"13020",4443,"of ladies. The house-doors were all open. The ladies came forth bearing","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"13026",4443,"of heaven and hell by a glorious tempest. Near morning an officer of","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"13027",4443,"volunteers came to inspect the barricade defences. Angelo knew him by","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"13028",4443,"sight; it was Luciano Romara. He explained the position of the opposing","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"13029",4443,"forces. The Marshal, he said, was clearly no street-fighter. Estimating","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"13030",4443,"the army under his orders in Milan at from ten to eleven thousand men of","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
"13031",4443,"all arms, it was impossible for him to guard the gates and then walls,","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"

"13033",4443,"Yesterday the troops had made one: charge and done mischief, but they","Vittoria — Complete","Meredith, George","Historical Fiction","en"
