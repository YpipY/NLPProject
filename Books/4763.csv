"171",4763,"important, and by no means easy to understand all in a moment:  so","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"172",4763,"please to read this VERY carefully.","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"173",4763,"","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"174",4763,"The world contains many THINGS (such as ""Buns"", ""Babies"", ""Beetles"".","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"

"180",4763,"an ADJECTIVE.  People have asked the question ""Can a Thing exist","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"181",4763,"without any Attributes belonging to it?""  It is a very puzzling","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"182",4763,"question, and I'm not going to try to answer it:  let us turn up","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"183",4763,"our noses, and treat it with contemptuous silence, as if it really","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"

"186",4763,"may say at once ""No:  no more than a Baby could go a railway-journey","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"

"190",4763,"","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"191",4763,"And now what am I driving at, in all this long rigmarole?  It is","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"192",4763,"this.  You may put ""is"" or ""are"" between names of two THINGS (for","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"193",4763,"example, ""some Pigs are fat Animals""), or between the names of two","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"194",4763,"ATTRIBUTES (for example, ""pink is light-red""), and in each case it","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"195",4763,"will make good sense.  But, if you put ""is"" or ""are"" between the","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"196",4763,"name of a THING and the name of an ATTRIBUTE (for example, ""some","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"197",4763,"Pigs are pink""), you do NOT make good sense (for how can a Thing","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"198",4763,"BE an Attribute?) unless you have an understanding with the person","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"199",4763,"to whom you are speaking.  And the simplest understanding would, I","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"200",4763,"think, be this--that the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"201",4763,"at the end of the sentence, so that the sentence, if written out","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"202",4763,"in full, would be ""some Pigs are pink (Pigs)"".  And now the word","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"

"204",4763,"","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"205",4763,"Thus, in order to make good sense of the Proposition ""some new Cakes","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"206",4763,"are nice"", we must suppose it to be written out in full, in the","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"207",4763,"form ""some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)"".  Now this contains two","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"208",4763,"'TERMS'--""new Cakes"" being one of them, and ""nice (Cakes)"" the","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"209",4763,"other.  ""New Cakes,"" being the one we are talking about, is called","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"210",4763,"the 'SUBJECT' of the Proposition, and ""nice (Cakes)"" the 'PREDICATE'.","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"211",4763,"Also this Proposition is said to be a 'PARTICULAR' one, since it","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"212",4763,"does not speak of the WHOLE of its Subject, but only of a PART of","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"213",4763,"it.  The other two kinds are said to be 'UNIVERSAL', because they","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"214",4763,"speak of the WHOLE of their Subjects--the one denying niceness, and","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"215",4763,"the other asserting it, of the WHOLE class of ""new Cakes"".  Lastly,","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"216",4763,"if you would like to have a definition of the word 'PROPOSITION'","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
"217",4763,"itself, you may take this:--""a sentence stating that some, or","The Game of Logic","Carroll, Lewis","Philosophy","en"
