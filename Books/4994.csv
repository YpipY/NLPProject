"453",4994,"compressed air could be sent out from either pipe. Thus when floating","Five Thousand Miles Underground; Or, the Mystery of the Centre of the Earth","Rockwood, Roy","Science Fiction","en"

"3437",4994,"beautiful scene that lay stretched out before them. The ship rested on","Five Thousand Miles Underground; Or, the Mystery of the Centre of the Earth","Rockwood, Roy","Science Fiction","en"
