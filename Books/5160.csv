"32",5160,"Notes appended to the various Tales, I have found myself led unavoidably","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"33",5160,"into a much more extensive course of reading than I had originally","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"34",5160,"contemplated, and one which in great measure bears directly upon the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"37",5160,"Before commencing these labours, I was aware, generally, that there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"38",5160,"existed a connexion between the Welsh Mabinogion and the Romance of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"39",5160,"Continent; but as I advanced, I became better acquainted with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"40",5160,"closeness and extent of that connexion, its history, and the proofs by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"41",5160,"which it is supported.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"42",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"43",5160,"At the same time, indeed, I became aware, and still strongly feel, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"44",5160,"it is one thing to collect facts, and quite another to classify and draw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"45",5160,"from them their legitimate conclusions; and though I am loth that what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"46",5160,"has been collected with some pains, should be entirely thrown away, it is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"47",5160,"unwillingly, and with diffidence, that I trespass beyond the acknowledged","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"51",5160,"notoriety in Europe, a body of “Romance,” which in various forms retained","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"52",5160,"its popularity till the Reformation.  In it the plot, the incidents, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"53",5160,"characters, were almost wholly those of Chivalry, that bond which united","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"54",5160,"the warriors of France, Spain, and Italy, with those of pure Teutonic","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"55",5160,"descent, and embraced more or less firmly all the nations of Europe,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"56",5160,"excepting only the Slavonic races, not yet risen to power, and the Celts,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"57",5160,"who had fallen from it.  It is not difficult to account for this latter","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"58",5160,"omission.  The Celts, driven from the plains into the mountains and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"59",5160,"islands, preserved their liberty, and hated their oppressors with fierce,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"60",5160,"and not causeless, hatred.  A proud and free people, isolated both in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"61",5160,"country and language, were not likely to adopt customs which implied","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"62",5160,"brotherhood with their foes.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"63",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"64",5160,"Such being the case, it is remarkable that when the chief romances are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"65",5160,"examined, the name of many of the heroes and their scenes of action are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"66",5160,"found to be Celtic, and those of persons and places famous in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"67",5160,"traditions of Wales and Brittany.  Of this the romances of Ywaine and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"68",5160,"Gawaine, Sir Perceval de Galles, Eric and Enide, Mort d’Arthur, Sir","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"69",5160,"Lancelot, Sir Tristan, the Graal, &c., may be cited as examples.  In some","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"71",5160,"in the same direction.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"72",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"73",5160,"It may seem difficult to account for this.  Although the ancient dominion","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"74",5160,"of the Celts over Europe is not without enduring evidence in the names of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"75",5160,"the mountains and streams, the great features of a country, yet the loss","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"76",5160,"of their prior language by the great mass of the Celtic nations in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"77",5160,"Southern Europe (if indeed their successors in territory be at all of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"78",5160,"their blood), prevents us from clearly seeing, and makes us wonder, how","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"79",5160,"stories, originally embodied in the Celtic dialects of Great Britain and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"80",5160,"France, could so influence the literature of nations to whom the Celtic","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"81",5160,"languages were utterly unknown.  Whence then came these internal marks,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"82",5160,"and these proper names of persons and places, the features of a story","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"83",5160,"usually of earliest date and least likely to change?","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"84",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"85",5160,"These romances were found in England, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"86",5160,"and even Iceland, as early as the beginning of the thirteenth and end of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"87",5160,"the twelfth century.  The Germans, who propagated them through the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"88",5160,"nations of the North, derived them certainly from France.  Robert Wace","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"89",5160,"published his Anglo-Norman Romance of the Brut d’Angleterre about 1155.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"90",5160,"Sir Tristan was written in French prose in 1170; and The Chevalier au","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"91",5160,"Lion, Chevalier de l’Epée, and Sir Lancelot du Lac, in metrical French,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"93",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"94",5160,"From these facts it is to be argued that the further back these romances","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"95",5160,"are traced, the more clearly does it appear that they spread over the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"96",5160,"Continent from the North-west of France.  The older versions, it may be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"97",5160,"remarked, are far more simple than the later corruptions.  In them there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"98",5160,"is less allusion to the habits and usages of Chivalry, and the Welsh","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"99",5160,"names and elements stand out in stronger relief.  It is a great step to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"100",5160,"be able to trace the stocks of these romances back to Wace, or to his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"101",5160,"country and age.  For Wace’s work was not original.  He himself, a native","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"102",5160,"of Jersey, appears to have derived much of it from the “Historia","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"103",5160,"Britonum” of Gruffydd ab Arthur, commonly known as “Geoffrey of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"104",5160,"Monmouth,” born 1128, who himself professes to have translated from a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"105",5160,"British original.  It is, however, very possible that Wace may have had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"106",5160,"access, like Geoffrey, to independent sources of information.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"109",5160,"the channels by which the Cymric tales passed into the Continental","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"110",5160,"Romance, may be added those of a third almost contemporary author.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"111",5160,"Layamon, a Saxon priest, dwelling, about 1200, upon the banks of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"112",5160,"upper Severn, acknowledges for the source of his British history, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"113",5160,"_English_ Bede, the _Latin_ Albin, and the _French_ Wace.  The last-named","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"114",5160,"however is by very much his chief, and, for Welsh matters, his only","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"115",5160,"avowed authority.  His book, nevertheless, contains a number of names and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"116",5160,"stories relating to Wales, of which no traces appear in Wace, or indeed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"117",5160,"in Geoffrey, but which he was certainly in a very favourable position to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"118",5160,"obtain for himself.  Layamon, therefore, not only confirms Geoffrey in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"119",5160,"some points, but it is clear, that, professing to follow Wace, he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"120",5160,"independent access to the great body of Welsh literature then current.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"121",5160,"Sir F. Madden has put this matter very clearly, in his recent edition of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"122",5160,"Layamon.  The Abbé de la Rue, also, was of opinion that Gaimar, an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"123",5160,"Anglo-Norman, in the reign of Stephen, usually regarded as a translator","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"126",5160,"In addition to these, is to be mentioned the English version of Sir","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"127",5160,"Tristrem, which Sir Walter Scott considered to be derived from a distinct","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"128",5160,"Celtic source, and not, like the later Amadis, Palmerin, and Lord","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"131",5160,"published by the Camden Society, their Editor, Mr. Robson, seems to hint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"137",5160,"improbable that there may have existed many others.  It appears then that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"159",5160,"tolerably distinct classes.  Of these, the older contains few allusions","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"161",5160,"less ancient, are full of such allusions, and of ecclesiastical terms.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"162",5160,"Both classes, no doubt, are equally of Welsh root, but the former are not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"163",5160,"more overlaid or corrupted, than might have been expected, from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"166",5160,"and re-translated after an absence of centuries, with a load of Norman","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"167",5160,"additions.  Kilhwch and Olwen, and the dream of Rhonabwy, may be cited as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"181",5160,"the Mabinogion, which deserves to be mentioned here.  This argument is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"182",5160,"founded on the topography of the country.  It is found that Saxon names","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"183",5160,"of places are very frequently definitions of the nature of the locality","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"184",5160,"to which they are attached, as Clifton, Deepden, Bridge-ford, Thorpe,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"185",5160,"Ham, Wick, and the like; whereas those of Wales are more frequently","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"186",5160,"commemorative of some event, real or supposed, said to have happened on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"187",5160,"or near the spot, or bearing allusion to some person renowned in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"188",5160,"story of the country or district.  Such are “Llyn y Morwynion,” the Lake","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"189",5160,"of the Maidens; “Rhyd y Bedd,” the Ford of the Grave; “Bryn Cyfergyr,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"190",5160,"the Hill of Assault; and so on.  But as these names could not have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"191",5160,"preceded the events to which they refer, the events themselves must be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"192",5160,"not unfrequently as old as the early settlement in the country.  And as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"193",5160,"some of these events and fictions are the subjects of, and are explained","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"194",5160,"by, existing Welsh legends, it follows that the legends must be, in some","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"195",5160,"shape or other, of very remote antiquity.  It will be observed that this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"196",5160,"argument supports _remote_ antiquity only for such legends as are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"197",5160,"connected with the greater topographical features, as mountains, lakes,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"198",5160,"rivers, seas, which must have been named at an early period in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"199",5160,"inhabitation of the country by man.  But there exist, also, legends","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"200",5160,"connected with the lesser features, as pools, hills, detached rocks,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"201",5160,"caves, fords, and the like, places not necessarily named by the earlier","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"203",5160,"since the words of which they are composed are in many cases not retained","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"205",5160,"are in some instances lost from the language altogether, so much so as to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"247",5160,"It appears to me, then, looking back upon what has been advanced:—","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"248",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"249",5160,"I.  That we have throughout Europe, at an early period, a great body of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"250",5160,"literature, known as Mediæval Romance, which, amidst much that is wholly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"251",5160,"of Teutonic origin and character, includes certain well-marked traces of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"252",5160,"an older Celtic nucleus.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"253",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"254",5160,"II.  Proceeding backwards in time, we find these romances, their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"255",5160,"ornaments falling away at each step, existing towards the twelfth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"256",5160,"century, of simpler structure, and with less encumbered Celtic features,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"257",5160,"in the works of Wace, and other Bards of the Langue d’Oil.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"258",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"259",5160,"III.  We find that Geoffrey of Monmouth, Layamon, and other early British","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"260",5160,"and Anglo-Saxon historians, and minstrels, on the one hand, transmitted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"261",5160,"to Europe the rudiments of its after romance, much of which, on the other","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"262",5160,"hand, they drew from Wales.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"263",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"264",5160,"IV.  Crossing into Wales we find, in the Mabinogion, the evident","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"265",5160,"counterpart of the Celtic portion of the continental romance, mixed up,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"266",5160,"indeed, with various reflex additions from beyond the border, but still","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"267",5160,"containing ample internal evidence of a Welsh original.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"270",5160,"Mabinogion, and the topographical nomenclature of part of the country, we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"271",5160,"find evidence of the great, though indefinite, antiquity of these tales,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"277",5160,"confirmed.  The subject is one not unworthy of the talents of a Llwyd or","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"306",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"307",5160,"In the centre of the chamber King Arthur sat upon a seat of green rushes,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"308",5160,"over which was spread a covering of flame-coloured satin, and a cushion","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"309",5160,"of red satin was under his elbow.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"310",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"311",5160,"Then Arthur spoke, “If I thought you would not disparage me,” said he, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"313",5160,"with relating tales, and can obtain a flagon of mead and some meat from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"314",5160,"Kai.”  And the King went to sleep.  And Kynon the son of Clydno asked Kai","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"315",5160,"for that which Arthur had promised them.  “I, too, will have the good","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"319",5160,"kitchen and to the mead-cellar, and returned bearing a flagon of mead and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"320",5160,"a golden goblet, and a handful of skewers, upon which were broiled","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"321",5160,"collops of meat.  Then they ate the collops and began to drink the mead.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"322",5160,"“Now,” said Kai, “it is time for you to give me my story.”  “Kynon,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"334",5160,"chanced that I came to the fairest valley in the world, wherein were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"335",5160,"trees of equal growth; and a river ran through the valley, and a path was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"336",5160,"by the side of the river.  And I followed the path until mid-day, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"337",5160,"continued my journey along the remainder of the valley until the evening;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"338",5160,"and at the extremity of a plain I came to a large and lustrous Castle, at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"339",5160,"the foot of which was a torrent.  And I approached the Castle, and there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"340",5160,"I beheld two youths with yellow curling hair, each with a frontlet of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"341",5160,"gold upon his head, and clad in a garment of yellow satin, and they had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"342",5160,"gold clasps upon their insteps.  In the hand of each of them was an ivory","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"343",5160,"bow, strung with the sinews of the stag; and their arrows had shafts of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"344",5160,"the bone of the whale, and were winged with peacock’s feathers; the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"345",5160,"shafts also had golden heads.  And they had daggers with blades of gold,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"346",5160,"and with hilts of the bone of the whale.  And they were shooting their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"347",5160,"daggers.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"348",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"349",5160,"“And a little way from them I saw a man in the prime of life, with his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"350",5160,"beard newly shorn, clad in a robe and a mantle of yellow satin; and round","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"351",5160,"the top of his mantle was a band of gold lace.  On his feet were shoes of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"352",5160,"variegated leather, fastened by two bosses of gold.  When I saw him, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"353",5160,"went towards him and saluted him, and such was his courtesy that he no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"354",5160,"sooner received my greeting than he returned it.  And he went with me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"355",5160,"towards the Castle.  Now there were no dwellers in the Castle except","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"356",5160,"those who were in one hall.  And there I saw four-and-twenty damsels,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"357",5160,"embroidering satin at a window.  And this I tell thee, Kai, that the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"358",5160,"least fair of them was fairer than the fairest maid thou hast ever beheld","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"359",5160,"in the Island of Britain, and the least lovely of them was more lovely","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"360",5160,"than Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur, when she has appeared loveliest at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"361",5160,"the Offering, on the day of the Nativity, or at the feast of Easter.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"362",5160,"They rose up at my coming, and six of them took my horse, and divested me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"363",5160,"of my armour; and six others took my arms, and washed them in a vessel","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"364",5160,"until they were perfectly bright.  And the third six spread cloths upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"365",5160,"the tables and prepared meat.  And the fourth six took off my soiled","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"366",5160,"garments, and placed others upon me; namely, an under-vest and a doublet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"367",5160,"of fine linen, and a robe, and a surcoat, and a mantle of yellow satin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"368",5160,"with a broad gold band upon the mantle.  And they placed cushions both","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"369",5160,"beneath and around me, with coverings of red linen; and I sat down.  Now","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"370",5160,"the six maidens who had taken my horse, unharnessed him, as well as if","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"371",5160,"they had been the best squires in the Island of Britain.  Then, behold,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"372",5160,"they brought bowls of silver wherein was water to wash, and towels of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"373",5160,"linen, some green and some white; and I washed.  And in a little while","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"374",5160,"the man sat down to the table.  And I sat next to him, and below me sat","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"375",5160,"all the maidens, except those who waited on us.  And the table was of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"376",5160,"silver, and the cloths upon the table were of linen; and no vessel was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"377",5160,"served upon the table that was not either of gold or of silver, or of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"378",5160,"buffalo-horn.  And our meat was brought to us.  And verily, Kai, I saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"379",5160,"there every sort of meat and every sort of liquor that I have ever seen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"380",5160,"elsewhere; but the meat and the liquor were better served there than I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"381",5160,"have ever seen them in any other place.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"382",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"383",5160,"“Until the repast was half over, neither the man nor any one of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"385",5160,"would be more agreeable to me to converse than to eat any more, he began","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"386",5160,"to inquire of me who I was.  I said I was glad to find that there was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"387",5160,"some one who would discourse with me, and that it was not considered so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"388",5160,"great a crime at that Court for people to hold converse together.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"389",5160,"‘Chieftain,’ said the man, ‘we would have talked to thee sooner, but we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"391",5160,"discourse.’  Then I told the man who I was, and what was the cause of my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"392",5160,"journey; and said that I was seeking whether any one was superior to me,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"393",5160,"or whether I could gain the mastery over all.  The man looked upon me,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"394",5160,"and he smiled and said, ‘If I did not fear to distress thee too much, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"411",5160,"to thee briefly, and will point out the road by which thou shalt find","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"414",5160,"“And long seemed that night to me.  And the next morning I arose and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"422",5160,"me of him.  As for the iron club which the man had told me was a burden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"423",5160,"for two men, I am certain, Kai, that it would be a heavy weight for four","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"424",5160,"warriors to lift; and this was in the black man’s hand.  And he only","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"425",5160,"spoke to me in answer to my questions.  Then I asked him what power he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"426",5160,"held over those animals. ‘I will show thee, little man,’ said he.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"427",5160,"took his club in his hand, and with it he struck a stag a great blow so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"428",5160,"that he brayed vehemently, and at his braying the animals came together,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"429",5160,"as numerous as the stars in the sky, so that it was difficult for me to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"430",5160,"find room in the glade to stand among them.  There were serpents, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"431",5160,"dragons, and divers sorts of animals.  And he looked at them, and bade","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"432",5160,"them go and feed; and they bowed their heads, and did him homage as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"433",5160,"vassals to their lord.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"434",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"435",5160,"“Then the black man said to me, ‘Seest thou now, little man, what power I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"436",5160,"hold over these animals?’  Then I inquired of him the way, and he became","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"437",5160,"very rough in his manner to me; however, he asked me whither I would go?","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"438",5160,"And when I told him who I was and what I sought, he directed me.  ‘Take,’","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"439",5160,"said he, ‘that path that leads towards the head of the glade, and ascend","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"440",5160,"the wooded steep until thou comest to its summit; and there thou wilt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"441",5160,"find an open space like to a large valley, and in the midst of it a tall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"442",5160,"tree, whose branches are greener than the greenest pine-trees.  Under","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"443",5160,"this tree is a fountain, and by the side of the fountain a marble slab,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"444",5160,"and on the marble slab a silver bowl, attached by a chain of silver, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"445",5160,"that it may not be carried away.  Take the bowl and throw a bowlful of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"446",5160,"water upon the slab, and thou wilt hear a mighty peal of thunder, so that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"447",5160,"thou wilt think that heaven and earth are trembling with its fury.  With","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"448",5160,"the thunder there will come a shower so severe that it will be scarce","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"449",5160,"possible for thee to endure it and live.  And the shower will be of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"450",5160,"hailstones; and after the shower, the weather will become fair, but every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"451",5160,"leaf that was upon the tree will have been carried away by the shower.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"452",5160,"Then a flight of birds will come and alight upon the tree; and in thine","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"453",5160,"own country thou didst never hear a strain so sweet as that which they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"454",5160,"will sing.  And at the moment thou art most delighted with the song of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"455",5160,"the birds, thou wilt hear a murmuring and complaining coming towards thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"456",5160,"along the valley.  And thou wilt see a knight upon a coal-black horse,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"457",5160,"clothed in black velvet, and with a pennon of black linen upon his lance;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"458",5160,"and he will ride unto thee to encounter thee with the utmost speed.  If","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"459",5160,"thou fleest from him he will overtake thee, and if thou abidest there, as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"460",5160,"sure as thou art a mounted knight, he will leave thee on foot.  And if","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"461",5160,"thou dost not find trouble in that adventure, thou needest not seek it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"462",5160,"during the rest of thy life.’","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"463",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"464",5160,"“So I journeyed on, until I reached the summit of the steep, and there I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"465",5160,"found everything as the black man had described it to me.  And I went up","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"466",5160,"to the tree, and beneath it I saw the fountain, and by its side the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"467",5160,"marble slab, and the silver bowl fastened by the chain.  Then I took the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"468",5160,"bowl, and cast a bowlful of water upon the slab; and thereupon, behold,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"469",5160,"the thunder came, much more violent than the black man had led me to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"470",5160,"expect; and after the thunder came the shower; and of a truth I tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"471",5160,"thee, Kai, that there is neither man nor beast that can endure that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"472",5160,"shower and live.  For not one of those hailstones would be stopped,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"473",5160,"either by the flesh or by the skin, until it had reached the bone.  I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"474",5160,"turned my horse’s flank towards the shower, and placed the beak of my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"475",5160,"shield over his head and neck, while I held the upper part of it over my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"476",5160,"own head.  And thus I withstood the shower.  When I looked on the tree","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"477",5160,"there was not a single leaf upon it, and then the sky became clear, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"478",5160,"with that, behold the birds lighted upon the tree, and sang.  And truly,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"479",5160,"Kai, I never heard any melody equal to that, either before or since.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"480",5160,"when I was most charmed with listening to the birds, lo, a murmuring","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"481",5160,"voice was heard through the valley, approaching me and saying, ‘Oh,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"482",5160,"Knight, what has brought thee hither?  What evil have I done to thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"483",5160,"that thou shouldst act towards me and my possessions as thou hast this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"484",5160,"day?  Dost thou not know that the shower to-day has left in my dominions","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"485",5160,"neither man nor beast alive that was exposed to it?’  And thereupon,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"486",5160,"behold, a Knight on a black horse appeared, clothed in jet-black velvet,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"487",5160,"and with a tabard of black linen about him.  And we charged each other,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"488",5160,"and, as the onset was furious, it was not long before I was overthrown.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"489",5160,"Then the Knight passed the shaft of his lance through the bridle rein of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"490",5160,"my horse, and rode off with the two horses, leaving me where I was.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"491",5160,"he did not even bestow so much notice upon me as to imprison me, nor did","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"492",5160,"he despoil me of my arms.  So I returned along the road by which I had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"493",5160,"come.  And when I reached the glade where the black man was, I confess to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"494",5160,"thee, Kai, it is a marvel that I did not melt down into a liquid pool,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"495",5160,"through the shame that I felt at the black man’s derision.  And that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"496",5160,"night I came to the same castle where I had spent the night preceding.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"497",5160,"And I was more agreeably entertained that night than I had been the night","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"498",5160,"before; and I was better feasted, and I conversed freely with the inmates","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"499",5160,"of the castle, and none of them alluded to my expedition to the fountain,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"500",5160,"neither did I mention it to any; and I remained there that night.  When I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"501",5160,"arose on the morrow, I found, ready saddled, a dark bay palfrey, with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"502",5160,"nostrils as red as scarlet; and after putting on my armour, and leaving","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"503",5160,"there my blessing, I returned to my own Court.  And that horse I still","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"504",5160,"possess, and he is in the stable yonder.  And I declare that I would not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"505",5160,"part with him for the best palfrey in the Island of Britain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"506",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"507",5160,"“Now of a truth, Kai, no man ever before confessed to an adventure so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"508",5160,"much to his own discredit, and verily it seems strange to me, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"509",5160,"neither before nor since have I heard of any person besides myself who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"510",5160,"knew of this adventure, and that the subject of it should exist within","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"511",5160,"King Arthur’s dominions, without any other person lighting upon it.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"512",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"513",5160,"“Now,” quoth Owain, “would it not be well to go and endeavour to discover","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"514",5160,"that place?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"515",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"516",5160,"“By the hand of my friend,” said Kai, “often dost thou utter that with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"517",5160,"thy tongue which thou wouldst not make good with thy deeds.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"518",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"519",5160,"“In very truth,” said Gwenhwyvar, “it were better thou wert hanged, Kai,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"520",5160,"than to use such uncourteous speech towards a man like Owain.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"521",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"522",5160,"“By the hand of my friend, good Lady,” said Kai, “thy praise of Owain is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"523",5160,"not greater than mine.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"524",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"525",5160,"With that Arthur awoke, and asked if he had not been sleeping a little.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"526",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"527",5160,"“Yes, Lord,” answered Owain, “thou hast slept awhile.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"528",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"529",5160,"“Is it time for us to go to meat?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"530",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"531",5160,"“It is, Lord,” said Owain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"532",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"533",5160,"Then the horn for washing was sounded, and the King and all his household","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"534",5160,"sat down to eat.  And when the meal was ended, Owain withdrew to his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"535",5160,"lodging, and made ready his horse and his arms.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"536",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"537",5160,"On the morrow, with the dawn of day, he put on his armour, and mounted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"538",5160,"his charger, and travelled through distant lands and over desert","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"539",5160,"mountains.  And at length he arrived at the valley which Kynon had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"540",5160,"described to him; and he was certain that it was the same that he sought.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"541",5160,"And journeying along the valley by the side of the river, he followed its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"542",5160,"course till he came to the plain and within sight of the Castle.  When he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"543",5160,"approached the Castle, he saw the youths shooting their daggers in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"544",5160,"place where Kynon had seen them, and the yellow man, to whom the Castle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"545",5160,"belonged, standing hard by.  And no sooner had Owain saluted the yellow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"546",5160,"man than he was saluted by him in return.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"547",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"548",5160,"And he went forward towards the Castle, and there he saw the chamber, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"549",5160,"when he had entered the chamber he beheld the maidens working at satin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"550",5160,"embroidery, in chairs of gold.  And their beauty and their comeliness","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"551",5160,"seemed to Owain far greater than Kynon had represented to him.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"552",5160,"rose to wait upon Owain, as they had done to Kynon, and the meal which","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"553",5160,"they set before him gave more satisfaction to Owain than it had done to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"554",5160,"Kynon.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"555",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"556",5160,"About the middle of the repast, the yellow man asked Owain the object of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"557",5160,"his journey.  And Owain made it known to him, and said, “I am in quest of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"558",5160,"the Knight who guards the fountain.”  Upon this the yellow man smiled,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"559",5160,"and said that he was as loth to point out that adventure to Owain as he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"560",5160,"had been to Kynon.  However, he described the whole to Owain, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"561",5160,"retired to rest.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"562",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"563",5160,"The next morning Owain found his horse made ready for him by the damsels,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"564",5160,"and he set forward and came to the glade where the black man was.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"565",5160,"the stature of the black man seemed more wonderful to Owain than it had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"566",5160,"done to Kynon, and Owain asked of him his road, and he showed it to him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"567",5160,"And Owain followed the road, as Kynon had done, till he came to the green","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"568",5160,"tree; and he beheld the fountain, and the slab beside the fountain, with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"569",5160,"the bowl upon it.  And Owain took the bowl, and threw a bowlful of water","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"570",5160,"upon the slab.  And, lo, the thunder was heard, and after the thunder","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"571",5160,"came the shower, much more violent than Kynon had described, and after","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"572",5160,"the shower the sky became bright.  And when Owain looked at the tree,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"573",5160,"there was not one leaf upon it.  And immediately the birds came, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"574",5160,"settled upon the tree, and sang.  And when their song was most pleasing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"575",5160,"to Owain, he beheld a Knight coming towards him through the valley, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"576",5160,"he prepared to receive him; and encountered him violently.  Having broken","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"577",5160,"both their lances, they drew their swords, and fought blade to blade.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"578",5160,"Then Owain struck the Knight a blow through his helmet, head-piece and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"579",5160,"visor, and through the skin, and the flesh, and the bone, until it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"580",5160,"wounded the very brain.  Then the black Knight felt that he had received","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"581",5160,"a mortal wound, upon which he turned his horse’s head, and fled.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"582",5160,"Owain pursued him, and followed close upon him, although he was not near","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"583",5160,"enough to strike him with his sword.  Thereupon Owain descried a vast and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"584",5160,"resplendent Castle.  And they came to the Castle gate.  And the black","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"585",5160,"Knight was allowed to enter, and the portcullis was let fall upon Owain;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"586",5160,"and it struck his horse behind the saddle, and cut him in two, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"587",5160,"carried away the rowels of the spurs that were upon Owain’s heels.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"588",5160,"the portcullis descended to the floor.  And the rowels of the spurs and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"589",5160,"part of the horse were without, and Owain with the other part of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"590",5160,"horse remained between the two gates, and the inner gate was closed, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"591",5160,"that Owain could not go thence; and Owain was in a perplexing situation.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"592",5160,"And while he was in this state, he could see through an aperture in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"593",5160,"gate, a street facing him, with a row of houses on each side.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"594",5160,"beheld a maiden, with yellow curling hair, and a frontlet of gold upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"595",5160,"her head; and she was clad in a dress of yellow satin, and on her feet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"596",5160,"were shoes of variegated leather.  And she approached the gate, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"597",5160,"desired that it should be opened.  “Heaven knows, Lady,” said Owain, “it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"598",5160,"is no more possible for me to open to thee from hence, than it is for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"599",5160,"thee to set me free.”  “Truly,” said the damsel, “it is very sad that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"600",5160,"thou canst not be released, and every woman ought to succour thee, for I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"601",5160,"never saw one more faithful in the service of ladies than thou.  As a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"602",5160,"friend thou art the most sincere, and as a lover the most devoted.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"603",5160,"Therefore,” quoth she, “whatever is in my power to do for thy release, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"604",5160,"will do it.  Take this ring and put it on thy finger, with the stone","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"605",5160,"inside thy hand; and close thy hand upon the stone.  And as long as thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"606",5160,"concealest it, it will conceal thee.  When they have consulted together,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"607",5160,"they will come forth to fetch thee, in order to put thee to death; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"608",5160,"they will be much grieved that they cannot find thee.  And I will await","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"609",5160,"thee on the horseblock yonder; and thou wilt be able to see me, though I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"610",5160,"cannot see thee; therefore come and place thy hand upon my shoulder, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"611",5160,"I may know that thou art near me.  And by the way that I go hence, do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"612",5160,"thou accompany me.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"613",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"614",5160,"Then she went away from Owain, and he did all that the maiden had told","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"615",5160,"him.  And the people of the Castle came to seek Owain, to put him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"616",5160,"death, and when they found nothing but the half of his horse, they were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"617",5160,"sorely grieved.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"618",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"619",5160,"And Owain vanished from among them, and went to the maiden, and placed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"620",5160,"his hand upon her shoulder; whereupon she set off, and Owain followed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"621",5160,"her, until they came to the door of a large and beautiful chamber, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"622",5160,"the maiden opened it, and they went in, and closed the door.  And Owain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"623",5160,"looked around the chamber, and behold there was not even a single nail in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"624",5160,"it that was not painted with gorgeous colours; and there was not a single","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"625",5160,"panel that had not sundry images in gold portrayed upon it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"626",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"627",5160,"The maiden kindled a fire, and took water in a silver bowl, and put a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"628",5160,"towel of white linen on her shoulder, and gave Owain water to wash.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"629",5160,"she placed before him a silver table, inlaid with gold; upon which was a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"630",5160,"cloth of yellow linen; and she brought him food.  And of a truth, Owain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"631",5160,"had never seen any kind of meat that was not there in abundance, but it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"632",5160,"was better cooked there than he had ever found it in any other place.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"633",5160,"Nor did he ever see so excellent a display of meat and drink, as there.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"634",5160,"And there was not one vessel from which he was served, that was not of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"635",5160,"gold or of silver.  And Owain ate and drank, until late in the afternoon,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"636",5160,"when lo, they heard a mighty clamour in the Castle; and Owain asked the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"637",5160,"maiden what that outcry was.  “They are administering extreme unction,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"638",5160,"said she, “to the Nobleman who owns the Castle.”  And Owain went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"639",5160,"sleep.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"640",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"641",5160,"The couch which the maiden had prepared for him was meet for Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"642",5160,"himself; it was of scarlet, and fur, and satin, and sendal, and fine","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"643",5160,"linen.  In the middle of the night they heard a woful outcry.  “What","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"644",5160,"outcry again is this?” said Owain.  “The Nobleman who owned the Castle is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"645",5160,"now dead,” said the maiden.  And a little after daybreak, they heard an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"646",5160,"exceeding loud clamour and wailing.  And Owain asked the maiden what was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"647",5160,"the cause of it.  “They are bearing to the church the body of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"648",5160,"Nobleman who owned the Castle.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"649",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"650",5160,"And Owain rose up, and clothed himself, and opened a window of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"651",5160,"chamber, and looked towards the Castle; and he could see neither the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"652",5160,"bounds, nor the extent of the hosts that filled the streets.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"653",5160,"were fully armed; and a vast number of women were with them, both on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"654",5160,"horseback and on foot; and all the ecclesiastics in the city, singing.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"655",5160,"And it seemed to Owain that the sky resounded with the vehemence of their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"656",5160,"cries, and with the noise of the trumpets, and with the singing of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"657",5160,"ecclesiastics.  In the midst of the throng, he beheld the bier, over","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"658",5160,"which was a veil of white linen; and wax tapers were burning beside and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"659",5160,"around it, and none that supported the bier was lower in rank than a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"660",5160,"powerful Baron.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"661",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"662",5160,"Never did Owain see an assemblage so gorgeous with satin, and silk, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"663",5160,"sendal.  And following the train, he beheld a lady with yellow hair","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"664",5160,"falling over her shoulders, and stained with blood; and about her a dress","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"665",5160,"of yellow satin, which was torn.  Upon her feet were shoes of variegated","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"666",5160,"leather.  And it was a marvel that the ends of her fingers were not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"667",5160,"bruised, from the violence with which she smote her hands together.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"668",5160,"Truly she would have been the fairest lady Owain ever saw, had she been","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"669",5160,"in her usual guise.  And her cry was louder than the shout of the men, or","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"670",5160,"the clamour of the trumpets.  No sooner had he beheld the lady, than he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"671",5160,"became inflamed with her love, so that it took entire possession of him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"672",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"673",5160,"Then he inquired of the maiden who the lady was.  “Heaven knows,” replied","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"674",5160,"the maiden, “she may be said to be the fairest, and the most chaste, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"675",5160,"the most liberal, and the wisest, and the most noble of women.  And she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"676",5160,"is my mistress; and she is called the Countess of the Fountain, the wife","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"677",5160,"of him whom thou didst slay yesterday.”  “Verily,” said Owain, “she is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"678",5160,"the woman that I love best.”  “Verily,” said the maiden, “she shall also","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"679",5160,"love thee not a little.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"680",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"681",5160,"And with that the maid arose, and kindled a fire, and filled a pot with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"682",5160,"water, and placed it to warm; and she brought a towel of white linen, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"683",5160,"placed it around Owain’s neck; and she took a goblet of ivory, and a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"684",5160,"silver basin, and filled them with warm water, wherewith she washed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"685",5160,"Owain’s head.  Then she opened a wooden casket, and drew forth a razor,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"686",5160,"whose haft was of ivory, and upon which were two rivets of gold.  And she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"687",5160,"shaved his beard, and she dried his head, and his throat, with the towel.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"688",5160,"Then she rose up from before Owain, and brought him to eat.  And truly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"689",5160,"Owain had never so good a meal, nor was he ever so well served.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"690",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"691",5160,"When he had finished his repast, the maiden arranged his couch.  “Come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"692",5160,"here,” said she, “and sleep, and I will go and woo for thee.”  And Owain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"693",5160,"went to sleep, and the maiden shut the door of the chamber after her, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"694",5160,"went towards the Castle.  When she came there, she found nothing but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"695",5160,"mourning, and sorrow; and the Countess in her chamber could not bear the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"696",5160,"sight of any one through grief.  Luned came and saluted her, but the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"697",5160,"Countess answered her not.  And the maiden bent down towards her, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"698",5160,"said, “What aileth thee, that thou answerest no one to-day?”  “Luned,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"699",5160,"said the Countess, “what change hath befallen thee, that thou hast not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"700",5160,"come to visit me in my grief?  It was wrong in thee, and I having made","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"701",5160,"thee rich; it was wrong in thee that thou didst not come to see me in my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"702",5160,"distress.  That was wrong in thee.”  “Truly,” said Luned, “I thought thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"703",5160,"good sense was greater than I find it to be.  Is it well for thee to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"704",5160,"mourn after that good man, or for anything else, that thou canst not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"705",5160,"have?”  “I declare to heaven,” said the Countess, “that in the whole","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"706",5160,"world there is not a man equal to him.”  “Not so,” said Luned, “for an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"707",5160,"ugly man would be as good as, or better than he.”  “I declare to heaven,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"708",5160,"said the Countess, “that were it not repugnant to me to cause to be put","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"709",5160,"to death one whom I have brought up, I would have thee executed, for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"710",5160,"making such a comparison to me.  As it is, I will banish thee.”  “I am","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"711",5160,"glad,” said Luned, “that thou hast no other cause to do so, than that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"712",5160,"would have been of service to thee where thou didst not know what was to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"713",5160,"thine advantage.  And henceforth evil betide whichever of us shall make","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"714",5160,"the first advance towards reconciliation to the other; whether I should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"715",5160,"seek an invitation from thee, or thou of thine own accord shouldst send","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"716",5160,"to invite me.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"717",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"718",5160,"With that Luned went forth: and the Countess arose and followed her to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"719",5160,"the door of the chamber, and began coughing loudly.  And when Luned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"720",5160,"looked back, the Countess beckoned to her; and she returned to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"721",5160,"Countess.  “In truth,” said the Countess, “evil is thy disposition; but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"722",5160,"if thou knowest what is to my advantage, declare it to me.”  “I will do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"723",5160,"so,” quoth she.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"724",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"725",5160,"“Thou knowest that except by warfare and arms it is impossible for thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"726",5160,"to preserve thy possessions; delay not, therefore, to seek some one who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"727",5160,"can defend them.”  “And how can I do that?” said the Countess.  “I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"728",5160,"tell thee,” said Luned.  “Unless thou canst defend the fountain, thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"729",5160,"canst not maintain thy dominions; and no one can defend the fountain,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"730",5160,"except it be a knight of Arthur’s household; and I will go to Arthur’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"731",5160,"Court, and ill betide me, if I return thence without a warrior who can","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"732",5160,"guard the fountain as well as, or even better than, he who defended it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"733",5160,"formerly.”  “That will be hard to perform,” said the Countess.  “Go,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"734",5160,"however, and make proof of that which thou hast promised.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"735",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"736",5160,"Luned set out, under the pretence of going to Arthur’s Court; but she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"737",5160,"went back to the chamber where she had left Owain; and she tarried there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"738",5160,"with him as long as it might have taken her to have travelled to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"739",5160,"Court of King Arthur.  And at the end of that time, she apparelled","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"740",5160,"herself and went to visit the Countess.  And the Countess was much","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"741",5160,"rejoiced when she saw her, and inquired what news she brought from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"742",5160,"Court.  “I bring thee the best of news,” said Luned, “for I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"743",5160,"compassed the object of my mission.  When wilt thou, that I should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"744",5160,"present to thee the chieftain who has come with me hither?”  “Bring him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"745",5160,"here to visit me to-morrow, at mid-day,” said the Countess, “and I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"746",5160,"cause the town to be assembled by that time.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"747",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"748",5160,"And Luned returned home.  And the next day, at noon, Owain arrayed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"749",5160,"himself in a coat, and a surcoat, and a mantle of yellow satin, upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"750",5160,"which was a broad band of gold lace; and on his feet were high shoes of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"751",5160,"variegated leather, which were fastened by golden clasps, in the form of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"752",5160,"lions.  And they proceeded to the chamber of the Countess.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"753",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"754",5160,"Right glad was the Countess of their coming, and she gazed steadfastly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"755",5160,"upon Owain, and said, “Luned, this knight has not the look of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"756",5160,"traveller.”  “What harm is there in that, lady?” said Luned.  “I am","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"757",5160,"certain,” said the Countess, “that no other man than this chased the soul","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"758",5160,"from the body of my lord.”  “So much the better for thee, lady,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"759",5160,"Luned, “for had he not been stronger than thy lord he could not have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"760",5160,"deprived him of life.  There is no remedy for that which is past, be it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"761",5160,"as it may.”  “Go back to thine abode,” said the Countess, “and I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"762",5160,"take counsel.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"763",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"764",5160,"The next day the Countess caused all her subjects to assemble, and showed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"765",5160,"them that her earldom was left defenceless, and that it could not be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"766",5160,"protected but with horse and arms, and military skill.  “Therefore,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"767",5160,"she, “this is what I offer for your choice: either let one of you take","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"768",5160,"me, or give your consent for me to take a husband from elsewhere to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"769",5160,"defend my dominions.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"770",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"771",5160,"So they came to the determination that it was better that she should have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"772",5160,"permission to marry some one from elsewhere; and, thereupon, she sent for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"773",5160,"the bishops and archbishops to celebrate her nuptials with Owain.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"774",5160,"the men of the earldom did Owain homage.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"775",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"776",5160,"And Owain defended the Fountain with lance and sword.  And this is the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"777",5160,"manner in which he defended it: Whensoever a knight came there he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"778",5160,"overthrew him, and sold him for his full worth, and what he thus gained","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"779",5160,"he divided among his barons and his knights; and no man in the whole","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"780",5160,"world could be more beloved than he was by his subjects.  And it was thus","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"781",5160,"for the space of three years.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"782",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"783",5160,"                                * * * * *","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"784",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"785",5160,"It befell that as Gwalchmai went forth one day with King Arthur, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"786",5160,"perceived him to be very sad and sorrowful.  And Gwalchmai was much","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"787",5160,"grieved to see Arthur in this state; and he questioned him, saying, “Oh,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"788",5160,"my lord! what has befallen thee?”  “In sooth, Gwalchmai,” said Arthur, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"789",5160,"am grieved concerning Owain, whom I have lost these three years, and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"790",5160,"shall certainly die if the fourth year passes without my seeing him.  Now","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"791",5160,"I am sure, that it is through the tale which Kynon the son of Clydno","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"792",5160,"related, that I have lost Owain.”  “There is no need for thee,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"793",5160,"Gwalchmai, “to summon to arms thy whole dominions on this account, for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"794",5160,"thou thyself and the men of thy household will be able to avenge Owain,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"795",5160,"if he be slain; or to set him free, if he be in prison; and, if alive, to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"796",5160,"bring him back with thee.”  And it was settled according to what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"797",5160,"Gwalchmai had said.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"798",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"799",5160,"Then Arthur and the men of his household prepared to go and seek Owain,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"800",5160,"and their number was three thousand, besides their attendants.  And Kynon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"801",5160,"the son of Clydno acted as their guide.  And Arthur came to the Castle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"802",5160,"where Kynon had been before, and when he came there the youths were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"803",5160,"shooting in the same place, and the yellow man was standing hard by.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"804",5160,"When the yellow man saw Arthur he greeted him, and invited him to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"805",5160,"Castle; and Arthur accepted his invitation, and they entered the Castle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"806",5160,"together.  And great as was the number of his retinue, their presence was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"807",5160,"scarcely observed in the Castle, so vast was its extent.  And the maidens","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"808",5160,"rose up to wait on them, and the service of the maidens appeared to them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"809",5160,"all to excel any attendance they had ever met with; and even the pages","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"810",5160,"who had charge of the horses were no worse served, that night, than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"811",5160,"Arthur himself would have been in his own palace.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"812",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"813",5160,"The next morning Arthur set out thence, with Kynon for his guide, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"814",5160,"came to the place where the black man was.  And the stature of the black","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"815",5160,"man was more surprising to Arthur than it had been represented to him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"816",5160,"And they came to the top of the wooded steep, and traversed the valley","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"817",5160,"till they reached the green tree, where they saw the fountain, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"818",5160,"bowl, and the slab.  And upon that, Kai came to Arthur and spoke to him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"819",5160,"“My lord,” said he, “I know the meaning of all this, and my request is,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"820",5160,"that thou wilt permit me to throw the water on the slab, and to receive","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"821",5160,"the first adventure that may befall.”  And Arthur gave him leave.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"822",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"823",5160,"Then Kai threw a bowlful of water upon the slab, and immediately there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"824",5160,"came the thunder, and after the thunder the shower.  And such a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"825",5160,"thunderstorm they had never known before, and many of the attendants who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"826",5160,"were in Arthur’s train were killed by the shower.  After the shower had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"827",5160,"ceased the sky became clear; and on looking at the tree they beheld it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"828",5160,"completely leafless.  Then the birds descended upon the tree, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"829",5160,"song of the birds was far sweeter than any strain they had ever heard","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"830",5160,"before.  Then they beheld a knight on a coal-black horse, clothed in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"831",5160,"black satin, coming rapidly towards them.  And Kai met him and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"832",5160,"encountered him, and it was not long before Kai was overthrown.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"833",5160,"knight withdrew, and Arthur and his host encamped for the night.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"834",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"835",5160,"And when they arose in the morning, they perceived the signal of combat","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"836",5160,"upon the lance of the Knight.  And Kai came to Arthur, and spoke to him:","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"837",5160,"“My lord,” said he, “though I was overthrown yesterday, if it seem good","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"838",5160,"to thee, I would gladly meet the Knight again to-day.”  “Thou mayst do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"839",5160,"so,” said Arthur.  And Kai went towards the Knight.  And on the spot he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"840",5160,"overthrew Kai, and struck him with the head of his lance in the forehead,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"841",5160,"so that it broke his helmet and the head-piece, and pierced the skin and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"842",5160,"the flesh, the breadth of the spear-head, even to the bone.  And Kai","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"843",5160,"returned to his companions.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"844",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"845",5160,"After this, all the household of Arthur went forth, one after the other,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"846",5160,"to combat the Knight, until there was not one that was not overthrown by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"847",5160,"him, except Arthur and Gwalchmai.  And Arthur armed himself to encounter","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"848",5160,"the Knight.  “Oh, my lord,” said Gwalchmai, “permit me to fight with him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"849",5160,"first.”  And Arthur permitted him.  And he went forth to meet the Knight,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"850",5160,"having over himself and his horse a satin robe of honour which had been","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"851",5160,"sent him by the daughter of the Earl of Rhangyw, and in this dress he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"852",5160,"not known by any of the host.  And they charged each other, and fought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"853",5160,"all that day until the evening, and neither of them was able to unhorse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"854",5160,"the other.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"855",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"856",5160,"The next day they fought with strong lances, and neither of them could","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"857",5160,"obtain the mastery.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"858",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"859",5160,"And the third day they fought with exceeding strong lances.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"860",5160,"were incensed with rage, and fought furiously, even until noon.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"861",5160,"gave each other such a shock that the girths of their horses were broken,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"862",5160,"so that they fell over their horses’ cruppers to the ground.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"863",5160,"rose up speedily, and drew their swords, and resumed the combat; and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"864",5160,"multitude that witnessed their encounter felt assured that they had never","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"865",5160,"before seen two men so valiant or so powerful.  And had it been midnight,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"866",5160,"it would have been light from the fire that flashed from their weapons.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"867",5160,"And the Knight gave Gwalchmai a blow that turned his helmet from off his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"868",5160,"face, so that the Knight knew that it was Gwalchmai.  Then Owain said,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"869",5160,"“My lord Gwalchmai, I did not know thee for my cousin, owing to the robe","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"870",5160,"of honour that enveloped thee; take my sword and my arms.”  Said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"871",5160,"Gwalchmai, “Thou, Owain, art the victor; take thou my sword.”  And with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"872",5160,"that Arthur saw that they were conversing, and advanced towards them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"873",5160,"“My lord Arthur,” said Gwalchmai, “here is Owain, who has vanquished me,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"874",5160,"and will not take my arms.”  “My lord,” said Owain, “it is he that has","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"875",5160,"vanquished me, and he will not take my sword.”  “Give me your swords,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"876",5160,"said Arthur, “and then neither of you has vanquished the other.”  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"877",5160,"Owain put his arms around Arthur’s neck, and they embraced.  And all the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"878",5160,"host hurried forward to see Owain, and to embrace him; and there was nigh","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"879",5160,"being a loss of life, so great was the press.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"880",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"881",5160,"And they retired that night, and the next day Arthur prepared to depart.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"882",5160,"“My lord,” said Owain, “this is not well of thee; for I have been absent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"883",5160,"from thee these three years, and during all that time, up to this very","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"884",5160,"day, I have been preparing a banquet for thee, knowing that thou wouldst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"885",5160,"come to seek me.  Tarry with me, therefore, until thou and thy attendants","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"886",5160,"have recovered the fatigues of the journey, and have been anointed.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"887",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"888",5160,"And they all proceeded to the Castle of the Countess of the Fountain, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"889",5160,"the banquet which had been three years preparing was consumed in three","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"890",5160,"months.  Never had they a more delicious or agreeable banquet.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"891",5160,"Arthur prepared to depart.  Then he sent an embassy to the Countess, to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"892",5160,"beseech her to permit Owain to go with him for the space of three months,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"893",5160,"that he might show him to the nobles and the fair dames of the Island of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"894",5160,"Britain.  And the Countess gave her consent, although it was very painful","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"895",5160,"to her.  So Owain came with Arthur to the Island of Britain.  And when he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"896",5160,"was once more amongst his kindred and friends, he remained three years,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"897",5160,"instead of three months, with them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"898",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"900",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"901",5160,"And as Owain one day sat at meat, in the city of Caerlleon upon Usk,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"902",5160,"behold a damsel entered upon a bay horse, with a curling mane and covered","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"903",5160,"with foam, and the bridle and so much as was seen of the saddle were of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"904",5160,"gold.  And the damsel was arrayed in a dress of yellow satin.  And she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"905",5160,"came up to Owain, and took the ring from off his hand.  “Thus,” said she,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"906",5160,"“shall be treated the deceiver, the traitor, the faithless, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"907",5160,"disgraced, and the beardless.”  And she turned her horse’s head and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"908",5160,"departed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"909",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"910",5160,"Then his adventure came to Owain’s remembrance, and he was sorrowful; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"911",5160,"having finished eating he went to his own abode and made preparations","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"912",5160,"that night.  And the next day he arose but did not go to the Court, but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"913",5160,"wandered to the distant parts of the earth and to uncultivated mountains.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"914",5160,"And he remained there until all his apparel was worn out, and his body","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"915",5160,"was wasted away, and his hair was grown long.  And he went about with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"916",5160,"wild beasts and fed with them, until they became familiar with him; but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"917",5160,"at length he grew so weak that he could no longer bear them company.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"918",5160,"Then he descended from the mountains to the valley, and came to a park","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"919",5160,"that was the fairest in the world, and belonged to a widowed Countess.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"920",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"921",5160,"One day the Countess and her maidens went forth to walk by a lake, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"922",5160,"was in the middle of the park.  And they saw the form of a man.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"923",5160,"were terrified.  Nevertheless they went near him, and touched him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"924",5160,"looked at him.  And they saw that there was life in him, though he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"925",5160,"exhausted by the heat of the sun.  And the Countess returned to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"926",5160,"Castle, and took a flask full of precious ointment, and gave it to one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"927",5160,"her maidens.  “Go with this,” said she, “and take with thee yonder horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"928",5160,"and clothing, and place them near the man we saw just now.  And anoint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"929",5160,"him with this balsam, near his heart; and if there is life in him, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"930",5160,"will arise through the efficacy of this balsam.  Then watch what he will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"931",5160,"do.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"932",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"933",5160,"And the maiden departed from her, and poured the whole of the balsam upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"934",5160,"Owain, and left the horse and the garments hard by, and went a little way","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"935",5160,"off, and hid herself to watch him.  In a short time she saw him begin to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"936",5160,"move his arms; and he rose up, and looked at his person, and became","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"937",5160,"ashamed of the unseemliness of his appearance.  Then he perceived the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"938",5160,"horse and the garments that were near him.  And he crept forward till he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"939",5160,"was able to draw the garments to him from off the saddle.  And he clothed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"940",5160,"himself, and with difficulty mounted the horse.  Then the damsel","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"941",5160,"discovered herself to him, and saluted him.  And he was rejoiced when he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"942",5160,"saw her, and inquired of her, what land and what territory that was.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"943",5160,"“Truly,” said the maiden, “a widowed Countess owns yonder Castle; at the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"944",5160,"death of her husband, he left her two Earldoms, but at this day she has","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"945",5160,"but this one dwelling that has not been wrested from her by a young Earl,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"946",5160,"who is her neighbour, because she refused to become his wife.”  “That is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"947",5160,"pity,” said Owain.  And he and the maiden proceeded to the Castle; and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"948",5160,"alighted there, and the maiden conducted him to a pleasant chamber, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"949",5160,"kindled a fire and left him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"950",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"951",5160,"And the maiden came to the Countess, and gave the flask into her hand.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"952",5160,"“Ha! maiden,” said the Countess, “where is all the balsam?”  “Have I not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"953",5160,"used it all?” said she.  “Oh, maiden,” said the Countess, “I cannot","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"954",5160,"easily forgive thee this; it is sad for me to have wasted seven-score","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"955",5160,"pounds’ worth of precious ointment upon a stranger whom I know not.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"956",5160,"However, maiden, wait thou upon him, until he is quite recovered.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"957",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"958",5160,"And the maiden did so, and furnished him with meat and drink, and fire,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"959",5160,"and lodging, and medicaments, until he was well again.  And in three","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"960",5160,"months he was restored to his former guise, and became even more comely","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"961",5160,"than he had ever been before.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"962",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"963",5160,"One day Owain heard a great tumult, and a sound of arms in the Castle,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"964",5160,"and he inquired of the maiden the cause thereof.  “The Earl,” said she,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"965",5160,"“whom I mentioned to thee, has come before the Castle, with a numerous","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"966",5160,"army, to subdue the Countess.”  And Owain inquired of her whether the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"967",5160,"Countess had a horse and arms in her possession.  “She has the best in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"968",5160,"the world,” said the maiden.  “Wilt thou go and request the loan of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"969",5160,"horse and arms for me,” said Owain, “that I may go and look at this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"970",5160,"army?”  “I will,” said the maiden.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"971",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"972",5160,"And she came to the Countess, and told her what Owain had said.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"973",5160,"Countess laughed.  “Truly,” said she, “I will even give him a horse and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"974",5160,"arms for ever; such a horse and such arms had he never yet, and I am glad","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"975",5160,"that they should be taken by him to-day, lest my enemies should have them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"976",5160,"against my will to-morrow.  Yet I know not what he would do with them.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"977",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"978",5160,"The Countess bade them bring out a beautiful black steed, upon which was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"979",5160,"a beechen saddle, and a suit of armour, for man and horse.  And Owain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"980",5160,"armed himself, and mounted the horse, and went forth, attended by two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"981",5160,"pages completely equipped, with horses and arms.  And when they came near","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"982",5160,"to the Earl’s army, they could see neither its extent nor its extremity.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"983",5160,"And Owain asked the pages in which troop the Earl was.  “In yonder","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"984",5160,"troop,” said they, “in which are four yellow standards.  Two of them are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"985",5160,"before, and two behind him.”  “Now,” said Owain, “do you return and await","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"986",5160,"me near the portal of the Castle.”  So they returned, and Owain pressed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"987",5160,"forward until he met the Earl.  And Owain drew him completely out of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"988",5160,"saddle, and turned his horse’s head towards the Castle, and though it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"989",5160,"with difficulty, he brought the Earl to the portal, where the pages","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"990",5160,"awaited him.  And in they came.  And Owain presented the Earl as a gift","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"991",5160,"to the Countess.  And said to her, “Behold a requital to thee for thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"992",5160,"blessed balsam.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"993",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"994",5160,"The army encamped around the Castle.  And the Earl restored to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"995",5160,"Countess the two Earldoms he had taken from her, as a ransom for his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"996",5160,"life; and for his freedom he gave her the half of his own dominions, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"997",5160,"all his gold, and his silver, and his jewels, besides hostages.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"998",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"999",5160,"And Owain took his departure.  And the Countess and all her subjects","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1000",5160,"besought him to remain, but Owain chose rather to wander through distant","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1001",5160,"lands and deserts.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1002",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1003",5160,"And as he journeyed, he heard a loud yelling in a wood.  And it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1004",5160,"repeated a second and a third time.  And Owain went towards the spot, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1005",5160,"beheld a huge craggy mound, in the middle of the wood; on the side of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1006",5160,"which was a grey rock.  And there was a cleft in the rock, and a serpent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1007",5160,"was within the cleft.  And near the rock stood a black lion, and every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1008",5160,"time the lion sought to go thence, the serpent darted towards him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1009",5160,"attack him.  And Owain unsheathed his sword, and drew near to the rock;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1010",5160,"and as the serpent sprang out, he struck him with his sword, and cut him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1011",5160,"in two.  And he dried his sword, and went on his way, as before.  But","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1012",5160,"behold the lion followed him, and played about him, as though it had been","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1013",5160,"a greyhound that he had reared.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1014",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1015",5160,"They proceeded thus throughout the day, until the evening.  And when it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1016",5160,"was time for Owain to take his rest, he dismounted, and turned his horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1017",5160,"loose in a flat and wooded meadow.  And he struck fire, and when the fire","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1018",5160,"was kindled, the lion brought him fuel enough to last for three nights.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1019",5160,"And the lion disappeared.  And presently the lion returned, bearing a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1020",5160,"fine large roebuck.  And he threw it down before Owain, who went towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1021",5160,"the fire with it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1022",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1023",5160,"And Owain took the roebuck, and skinned it, and placed collops of its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1024",5160,"flesh upon skewers, around the fire.  The rest of the buck he gave to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1025",5160,"lion to devour.  While he was doing this, he heard a deep sigh near him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1026",5160,"and a second, and a third.  And Owain called out to know whether the sigh","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1027",5160,"he heard proceeded from a mortal; and he received answer that it did.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1028",5160,"“Who art thou?” said Owain.  “Truly,” said the voice, “I am Luned, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1029",5160,"handmaiden of the Countess of the Fountain.”  “And what dost thou here?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1030",5160,"said Owain.  “I am imprisoned,” said she, “on account of the knight who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1031",5160,"came from Arthur’s Court, and married the Countess.  And he stayed a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1032",5160,"short time with her, but he afterwards departed for the Court of Arthur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1033",5160,"and has not returned since.  And he was the friend I loved best in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1034",5160,"world.  And two of the pages in the Countess’s chamber traduced him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1035",5160,"called him a deceiver.  And I told them that they two were not a match","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1036",5160,"for him alone.  So they imprisoned me in the stone vault, and said that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1037",5160,"should be put to death, unless he came himself to deliver me, by a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1038",5160,"certain day; and that is no further off than the day after to-morrow.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1039",5160,"And I have no one to send to seek him for me.  And his name is Owain the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1040",5160,"son of Urien.”  “And art thou certain that if that knight knew all this,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1041",5160,"he would come to thy rescue?”  “I am most certain of it,” said she.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1042",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1043",5160,"When the collops were cooked, Owain divided them into two parts, between","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1044",5160,"himself and the maiden; and after they had eaten, they talked together,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1045",5160,"until the day dawned.  And the next morning Owain inquired of the damsel,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1046",5160,"if there was any place where he could get food and entertainment for that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1047",5160,"night.  “There is, Lord,” said she; “cross over yonder, and go along the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1048",5160,"side of the river, and in a short time thou wilt see a great Castle, in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1049",5160,"which are many towers, and the Earl who owns that Castle is the most","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1050",5160,"hospitable man in the world.  There thou mayst spend the night.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1051",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1052",5160,"Never did sentinel keep stricter watch over his lord, than the lion that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1053",5160,"night over Owain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1054",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1055",5160,"And Owain accoutred his horse, and passed across by the ford, and came in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1056",5160,"sight of the Castle.  And he entered it, and was honourably received.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1057",5160,"And his horse was well cared for, and plenty of fodder was placed before","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1058",5160,"him.  Then the lion went and lay down in the horse’s manger; so that none","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1059",5160,"of the people of the Castle dared to approach him.  The treatment which","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1060",5160,"Owain met with there was such as he had never known elsewhere, for every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1061",5160,"one was as sorrowful as though death had been upon him.  And they went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1062",5160,"meat; and the Earl sat upon one side of Owain, and on the other side his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1063",5160,"only daughter.  And Owain had never seen any more lovely than she.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1064",5160,"the lion came and placed himself between Owain’s feet, and he fed him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1065",5160,"with every kind of food that he took himself.  And he never saw anything","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1066",5160,"equal to the sadness of the people.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1067",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1068",5160,"In the middle of the repast the Earl began to bid Owain welcome.  “Then,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1069",5160,"said Owain, “behold, it is time for thee to be cheerful.”  “Heaven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1070",5160,"knows,” said the Earl, “that it is not thy coming that makes us","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1071",5160,"sorrowful, but we have cause enough for sadness and care.”  “What is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1072",5160,"that?” said Owain.  “I have two sons,” replied the Earl, “and yesterday","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1073",5160,"they went to the mountains to hunt.  Now there is on the mountain a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1074",5160,"monster who kills men and devours them, and he seized my sons; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1075",5160,"to-morrow is the time he has fixed to be here, and he threatens that he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1076",5160,"will then slay my sons before my eyes, unless I will deliver into his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1077",5160,"hands this my daughter.  He has the form of a man, but in stature he is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1078",5160,"no less than a giant.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1079",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1080",5160,"“Truly,” said Owain, “that is lamentable.  And which wilt thou do?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1081",5160,"“Heaven knows,” said the Earl, “it will be better that my sons should be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1082",5160,"slain against my will, than that I should voluntarily give up my daughter","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1083",5160,"to him to ill-treat and destroy.”  Then they talked about other things,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1084",5160,"and Owain stayed there that night.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1085",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1086",5160,"The next morning they heard an exceeding great clamour, which was caused","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1087",5160,"by the coming of the giant with the two youths.  And the Earl was anxious","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1088",5160,"both to protect his Castle and to release his two sons.  Then Owain put","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1089",5160,"on his armour and went forth to encounter the giant, and the lion","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1090",5160,"followed him.  And when the giant saw that Owain was armed, he rushed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1091",5160,"towards him and attacked him.  And the lion fought with the giant much","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1092",5160,"more fiercely than Owain did.  “Truly,” said the giant, “I should find no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1093",5160,"difficulty in fighting with thee, were it not for the animal that is with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1094",5160,"thee.”  Upon that Owain took the lion back to the Castle and shut the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1095",5160,"gate upon him, and then he returned to fight the giant, as before.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1096",5160,"the lion roared very loud, for he heard that it went hard with Owain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1097",5160,"And he climbed up till he reached the top of the Earl’s hall, and thence","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1098",5160,"he got to the top of the Castle, and he sprang down from the walls and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1099",5160,"went and joined Owain.  And the lion gave the giant a stroke with his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1100",5160,"paw, which tore him from his shoulder to his hip, and his heart was laid","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1101",5160,"bare, and the giant fell down dead.  Then Owain restored the two youths","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1102",5160,"to their father.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1103",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1104",5160,"The Earl besought Owain to remain with him, and he would not, but set","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1105",5160,"forward towards the meadow where Luned was.  And when he came there he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1106",5160,"saw a great fire kindled, and two youths with beautiful curling auburn","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1107",5160,"hair were leading the maiden to cast her into the fire.  And Owain asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1108",5160,"them what charge they had against her.  And they told him of the compact","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1109",5160,"that was between them, as the maiden had done the night before.  “And,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1110",5160,"said they, “Owain has failed her, therefore we are taking her to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1111",5160,"burnt.”  “Truly,” said Owain, “he is a good knight, and if he knew that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1112",5160,"the maiden was in such peril, I marvel that he came not to her rescue;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1113",5160,"but if you will accept me in his stead, I will do battle with you.”  “We","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1114",5160,"will,” said the youths, “by him who made us.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1115",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1116",5160,"And they attacked Owain, and he was hard beset by them.  And with that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1117",5160,"the lion came to Owain’s assistance, and they two got the better of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1118",5160,"young men.  And they said to him, “Chieftain, it was not agreed that we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1119",5160,"should fight save with thyself alone, and it is harder for us to contend","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1120",5160,"with yonder animal than with thee.”  And Owain put the lion in the place","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1121",5160,"where the maiden had been imprisoned, and blocked up the door with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1122",5160,"stones, and he went to fight with the young men, as before.  But Owain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1123",5160,"had not his usual strength, and the two youths pressed hard upon him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1124",5160,"And the lion roared incessantly at seeing Owain in trouble; and he burst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1125",5160,"through the wall until he found a way out, and rushed upon the young men,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1126",5160,"and instantly slew them.  So Luned was saved from being burned.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1127",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1128",5160,"Then Owain returned with Luned to the dominions of the Countess of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1129",5160,"Fountain.  And when he went thence he took the Countess with him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1130",5160,"Arthur’s Court, and she was his wife as long as she lived.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1131",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1133",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1134",5160,"And then he took the road that led to the Court of the savage black man,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1135",5160,"and Owain fought with him, and the lion did not quit Owain until he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1136",5160,"vanquished him.  And when he reached the Court of the savage black man he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1137",5160,"entered the hall, and beheld four-and-twenty ladies, the fairest that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1138",5160,"could be seen.  And the garments which they had on were not worth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1139",5160,"four-and twenty pence, and they were as sorrowful as death.  And Owain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1140",5160,"asked them the cause of their sadness.  And they said, “We are the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1141",5160,"daughters of Earls, and we all came here with our husbands, whom we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1142",5160,"dearly loved.  And we were received with honour and rejoicing.  And we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1143",5160,"were thrown into a state of stupor, and while we were thus, the demon who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1144",5160,"owns this Castle slew all our husbands, and took from us our horses, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1145",5160,"our raiment, and our gold, and our silver; and the corpses of our","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1146",5160,"husbands are still in this house, and many others with them.  And this,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1147",5160,"Chieftain, is the cause of our grief, and we are sorry that thou art come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1148",5160,"hither, lest harm should befall thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1149",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1150",5160,"And Owain was grieved when he heard this.  And he went forth from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1151",5160,"Castle, and he beheld a knight approaching him, who saluted him in a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1152",5160,"friendly and cheerful manner, as if he had been a brother.  And this was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1153",5160,"the savage black man.  “In very sooth,” said Owain, “it is not to seek","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1154",5160,"thy friendship that I am here.”  “In sooth,” said he, “thou shalt not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1155",5160,"find it then.”  And with that they charged each other, and fought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1156",5160,"furiously.  And Owain overcame him, and bound his hands behind his back.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1157",5160,"Then the black savage besought Owain to spare his life, and spoke thus:","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1158",5160,"“My lord Owain,” said he, “it was foretold that thou shouldst come hither","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1159",5160,"and vanquish me, and thou hast done so.  I was a robber here, and my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1160",5160,"house was a house of spoil; but grant me my life, and I will become the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1161",5160,"keeper of an Hospice, and I will maintain this house as an Hospice for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1162",5160,"weak and for strong, as long as I live, for the good of thy soul.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1163",5160,"Owain accepted this proposal of him, and remained there that night.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1164",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1165",5160,"And the next day he took the four-and-twenty ladies, and their horses,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1166",5160,"and their raiment, and what they possessed of goods and jewels, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1167",5160,"proceeded with them to Arthur’s Court.  And if Arthur was rejoiced when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1168",5160,"he saw him, after he had lost him the first time, his joy was now much","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1169",5160,"greater.  And of those ladies, such as wished to remain in Arthur’s Court","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1170",5160,"remained there, and such as wished to depart departed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1171",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1172",5160,"And thenceforward Owain dwelt at Arthur’s Court greatly beloved, as the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1173",5160,"head of his household, until he went away with his followers; and those","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1174",5160,"were the army of three hundred ravens which Kenverchyn had left him.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1185",5160,"EARL EVRAWC owned the Earldom of the North.  And he had seven sons.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1186",5160,"Evrawc maintained himself not so much by his own possessions as by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1187",5160,"attending tournaments, and wars, and combats.  And, as it often befalls","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1188",5160,"those who join in encounters and wars, he was slain, and six of his sons","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1189",5160,"likewise.  Now the name of his seventh son was Peredur, and he was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1190",5160,"youngest of them.  And he was not of an age to go to wars and encounters,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1191",5160,"otherwise he might have been slain as well as his father and brothers.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1192",5160,"His mother was a scheming and thoughtful woman, and she was very","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1193",5160,"solicitous concerning this her only son and his possessions.  So she took","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1194",5160,"counsel with herself to leave the inhabited country, and to flee to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1195",5160,"deserts and unfrequented wildernesses.  And she permitted none to bear","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1196",5160,"her company thither but women and boys, and spiritless men, who were both","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1197",5160,"unaccustomed and unequal to war and fighting.  And none dared to bring","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1198",5160,"either horses or arms where her son was, lest he should set his mind upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1199",5160,"them.  And the youth went daily to divert himself in the forest, by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1200",5160,"flinging sticks and staves.  And one day he saw his mother’s flock of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1201",5160,"goats, and near the goats two hinds were standing.  And he marvelled","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1202",5160,"greatly that these two should be without horns, while the others had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1203",5160,"them.  And he thought they had long run wild, and on that account they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1204",5160,"had lost their horns.  And by activity and swiftness of foot, he drove","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1205",5160,"the hinds and the goats together into the house which there was for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1206",5160,"goats at the extremity of the forest.  Then Peredur returned to his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1207",5160,"mother.  “Ah, mother,” said he, “a marvellous thing have I seen in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1208",5160,"wood; two of thy goats have run wild, and lost their horns, through their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1209",5160,"having been so long missing in the wood.  And no man had ever more","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1210",5160,"trouble than I had to drive them in.”  Then they all arose and went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1211",5160,"see.  And when they beheld the hinds they were greatly astonished.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1212",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1213",5160,"And one day they saw three knights coming along the horse-road on the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1214",5160,"borders of the forest.  And the three knights were Gwalchmai the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1215",5160,"Gwyar, and Geneir Gwystyl, and Owain the son of Urien.  And Owain kept on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1216",5160,"the track of the knight who had divided the apples in Arthur’s Court,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1217",5160,"whom they were in pursuit of.  “Mother,” said Peredur, “what are those","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1218",5160,"yonder?”  “They are angels, my son,” said she.  “By my faith,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1219",5160,"Peredur, “I will go and become an angel with them.”  And Peredur went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1220",5160,"the road, and met them.  “Tell me, good soul,” said Owain, “sawest thou a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1221",5160,"knight pass this way, either to-day or yesterday?”  “I know not,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1222",5160,"answered he, “what a knight is.”  “Such an one as I am,” said Owain.  “If","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1223",5160,"thou wilt tell me what I ask thee, I will tell thee that which thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1224",5160,"askest me.”  “Gladly will I do so,” replied Owain.  “What is this?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1225",5160,"demanded Peredur, concerning the saddle.  “It is a saddle,” said Owain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1226",5160,"Then he asked about all the accoutrements which he saw upon the men, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1227",5160,"the horses, and the arms, and what they were for, and how they were used.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1228",5160,"And Owain shewed him all these things fully, and told him what use was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1229",5160,"made of them.  “Go forward,” said Peredur, “for I saw such an one as thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1230",5160,"inquirest for, and I will follow thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1231",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1232",5160,"Then Peredur returned to his mother and her company, and he said to her,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1233",5160,"“Mother, those were not angels, but honourable knights.”  Then his mother","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1234",5160,"swooned away.  And Peredur went to the place where they kept the horses","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1235",5160,"that carried firewood, and that brought meat and drink from the inhabited","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1236",5160,"country to the desert.  And he took a bony piebald horse, which seemed to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1237",5160,"him the strongest of them.  And he pressed a pack into the form of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1238",5160,"saddle, and with twisted twigs he imitated the trappings which he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1239",5160,"seen upon the horses.  And when Peredur came again to his mother, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1240",5160,"Countess had recovered from her swoon.  “My son,” said she, “desirest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1241",5160,"thou to ride forth?”  “Yes, with thy leave,” said he.  “Wait, then, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1242",5160,"I may counsel thee before thou goest.”  “Willingly,” he answered; “speak","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1243",5160,"quickly.”  “Go forward, then,” she said, “to the Court of Arthur, where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1244",5160,"there are the best, and the boldest, and the most bountiful of men.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1245",5160,"wherever thou seest a church, repeat there thy Paternoster unto it.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1246",5160,"if thou see meat and drink, and have need of them, and none have the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1247",5160,"kindness or the courtesy to give them to thee, take them thyself.  If","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1248",5160,"thou hear an outcry, proceed towards it, especially if it be the outcry","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1249",5160,"of a woman.  If thou see a fair jewel, possess thyself of it, and give it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1250",5160,"to another, for thus thou shalt obtain praise.  If thou see a fair woman,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1251",5160,"pay thy court to her, whether she will or no; for thus thou wilt render","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1252",5160,"thyself a better and more esteemed man than thou wast before.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1253",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1254",5160,"After this discourse, Peredur mounted the horse, and taking a handful of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1255",5160,"sharp-pointed forks in his hand, he rode forth.  And he journeyed two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1256",5160,"days and two nights in the woody wildernesses, and in desert places,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1257",5160,"without food and without drink.  And then he came to a vast wild wood,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1258",5160,"and far within the wood he saw a fair even glade, and in the glade he saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1259",5160,"a tent, and the tent seeming to him to be a church, he repeated his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1260",5160,"Paternoster to it.  And he went towards it, and the door of the tent was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1261",5160,"open.  And a golden chair was near the door.  And on the chair sat a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1262",5160,"lovely auburn-haired maiden, with a golden frontlet on her forehead, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1263",5160,"sparkling stones in the frontlet, and with a large gold ring on her hand.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1264",5160,"And Peredur dismounted, and entered the tent.  And the maiden was glad at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1265",5160,"his coming, and bade him welcome.  At the entrance of the tent he saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1266",5160,"food, and two flasks full of wine, and two loaves of fine wheaten flour,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1267",5160,"and collops of the flesh of the wild boar.  “My mother told me,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1268",5160,"Peredur, “wheresoever I saw meat and drink, to take it.”  “Take the meat","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1269",5160,"and welcome, chieftain,” said she.  So Peredur took half of the meat and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1270",5160,"of the liquor himself, and left the rest to the maiden.  And when Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1271",5160,"had finished eating, he bent upon his knee before the maiden.  “My","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1272",5160,"mother,” said he, “told me, wheresoever I saw a fair jewel, to take it.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1273",5160,"“Do so, my soul,” said she.  So Peredur took the ring.  And he mounted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1274",5160,"his horse, and proceeded on his journey.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1275",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1276",5160,"After this, behold the knight came to whom the tent belonged; and he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1277",5160,"the Lord of the Glade.  And he saw the track of the horse, and he said to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1278",5160,"the maiden, “Tell me who has been here since I departed.”  “A man,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1279",5160,"she, “of wonderful demeanour.”  And she described to him what Peredur’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1280",5160,"appearance and conduct had been.  “Tell me,” said he, “did he offer thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1281",5160,"any wrong?”  “No,” answered the maiden, “by my faith, he harmed me not.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1282",5160,"“By my faith, I do not believe thee; and until I can meet with him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1283",5160,"revenge the insult he has done me, and wreak my vengeance upon him, thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1284",5160,"shalt not remain two nights in the same house.”  And the knight arose,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1285",5160,"and set forth to seek Peredur.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1286",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1287",5160,"Meanwhile Peredur journeyed on towards Arthur’s Court.  And before he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1288",5160,"reached it, another knight had been there, who gave a ring of thick gold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1289",5160,"at the door of the gate for holding his horse, and went into the Hall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1290",5160,"where Arthur and his household, and Gwenhwyvar and her maidens, were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1291",5160,"assembled.  And the page of the chamber was serving Gwenhwyvar with a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1292",5160,"golden goblet.  Then the knight dashed the liquor that was therein upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1293",5160,"her face, and upon her stomacher, and gave her a violent blow on the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1294",5160,"face, and said, “If any have the boldness to dispute this goblet with me,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1295",5160,"and to revenge the insult to Gwenhwyvar, let him follow me to the meadow,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1296",5160,"and there I will await him.”  So the knight took his horse, and rode to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1297",5160,"the meadow.  And all the household hung down their heads, lest any of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1298",5160,"them should be requested to go and avenge the insult to Gwenhwyvar.  For","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1299",5160,"it seemed to them, that no one would have ventured on so daring an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1300",5160,"outrage, unless he possessed such powers, through magic or charms, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1301",5160,"none could be able to take vengeance upon him.  Then, behold, Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1302",5160,"entered the Hall, upon the bony piebald horse, with the uncouth trappings","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1303",5160,"upon it; and in this way he traversed the whole length of the Hall.  In","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1304",5160,"the centre of the Hall stood Kai.  “Tell me, tall man,” said Peredur, “is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1305",5160,"that Arthur yonder?”  “What wouldest thou with Arthur?” asked Kai.  “My","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1306",5160,"mother told me to go to Arthur, and receive the honour of knighthood.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1307",5160,"“By my faith,” said he, “thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1308",5160,"with arms.”  Thereupon he was perceived by all the household, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1309",5160,"threw sticks at him.  Then, behold, a dwarf came forward.  He had already","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1310",5160,"been a year at Arthur’s Court, both he and a female dwarf.  They had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1311",5160,"craved harbourage of Arthur, and had obtained it; and during the whole","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1312",5160,"year, neither of them had spoken a single word to any one.  When the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1313",5160,"dwarf beheld Peredur, “Haha!” said he, “the welcome of Heaven be unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1314",5160,"thee, goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc, the chief of warriors, and flower of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1315",5160,"knighthood.”  “Truly,” said Kai, “thou art ill-taught to remain a year","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1316",5160,"mute at Arthur’s Court, with choice of society; and now, before the face","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1317",5160,"of Arthur and all his household, to call out, and declare such a man as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1318",5160,"this the chief of warriors, and the flower of knighthood.”  And he gave","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1319",5160,"him such a box on the ear that he fell senseless to the ground.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1320",5160,"exclaimed the female dwarf, “Haha! goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc; the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1321",5160,"welcome of Heaven be unto thee, flower of knights, and light of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1322",5160,"chivalry.”  “Of a truth, maiden,” said Kai, “thou art ill-bred to remain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1323",5160,"mute for a year at the Court of Arthur, and then to speak as thou dost of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1324",5160,"such a man as this.”  And Kai kicked her with his foot, so that she fell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1325",5160,"to the ground senseless.  “Tall man,” said Peredur, “shew me which is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1326",5160,"Arthur.”  “Hold thy peace,” said Kai, “and go after the knight who went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1327",5160,"hence to the meadow, and take from him the goblet, and overthrow him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1328",5160,"possess thyself of his horse and arms, and then thou shalt receive the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1329",5160,"order of knighthood.”  “I will do so, tall man,” said Peredur.  So he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1330",5160,"turned his horse’s head towards the meadow.  And when he came there, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1331",5160,"knight was riding up and down, proud of his strength, and valour, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1332",5160,"noble mien.  “Tell me,” said the knight, “didst thou see any one coming","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1333",5160,"after me from the Court?”  “The tall man that was there,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1334",5160,"“desired me to come, and overthrow thee, and to take from thee the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1335",5160,"goblet, and thy horse and thy armour for myself.”  “Silence!” said the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1336",5160,"knight; “go back to the Court, and tell Arthur, from me, either to come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1337",5160,"himself, or to send some other to fight with me; and unless he do so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1338",5160,"quickly, I will not wait for him.”  “By my faith,” said Peredur, “choose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1339",5160,"thou whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly, but I will have the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1340",5160,"horse, and the arms, and the goblet.”  And upon this the knight ran at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1341",5160,"him furiously, and struck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1342",5160,"between the neck and the shoulder.  “Haha! lad,” said Peredur, “my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1343",5160,"mother’s servants were not used to play with me in this wise; therefore,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1344",5160,"thus will I play with thee.”  And thereupon he struck him with a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1345",5160,"sharp-pointed fork, and it hit him in the eye, and came out at the back","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1346",5160,"of his neck, so that he instantly fell down lifeless.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1347",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1348",5160,"“Verily,” said Owain the son of Urien to Kai, “thou wert ill-advised,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1349",5160,"when thou didst send that madman after the knight.  For one of two things","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1350",5160,"must befall him.  He must either be overthrown, or slain.  If he is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1351",5160,"overthrown by the knight, he will be counted by him to be an honourable","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1352",5160,"person of the Court, and an eternal disgrace will it be to Arthur and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1353",5160,"warriors.  And if he is slain, the disgrace will be the same, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1354",5160,"moreover, his sin will be upon him; therefore will I go to see what has","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1355",5160,"befallen him.”  So Owain went to the meadow, and he found Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1356",5160,"dragging the man about.  “What art thou doing thus?” said Owain.  “This","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1357",5160,"iron coat,” said Peredur, “will never come from off him; not by my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1358",5160,"efforts, at any rate.”  And Owain unfastened his armour and his clothes.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1359",5160,"“Here, my good soul,” said he, “is a horse and armour better than thine.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1360",5160,"Take them joyfully, and come with me to Arthur, to receive the order of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1361",5160,"knighthood, for thou dost merit it.”  “May I never shew my face again if","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1362",5160,"I go,” said Peredur; “but take thou the goblet to Gwenhwyvar, and tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1363",5160,"Arthur, that wherever I am, I will be his vassal, and will do him what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1364",5160,"profit and service I am able.  And say that I will not come to his Court","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1365",5160,"until I have encountered the tall man that is there, to revenge the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1366",5160,"injury he did to the dwarf and dwarfess.”  And Owain went back to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1367",5160,"Court, and related all these things to Arthur and Gwenhwyvar, and to all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1368",5160,"the household.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1369",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1370",5160,"And Peredur rode forward.  And as he proceeded, behold a knight met him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1371",5160,"“Whence comest thou?” said the knight.  “I come from Arthur’s Court,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1372",5160,"said Peredur.  “Art thou one of his men?” asked he.  “Yes, by my faith,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1373",5160,"he answered.  “A good service, truly, is that of Arthur.”  “Wherefore","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1374",5160,"sayest thou so?” said Peredur.  “I will tell thee,” said he; “I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1375",5160,"always been Arthur’s enemy, and all such of his men as I have ever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1376",5160,"encountered I have slain.”  And without further parlance they fought, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1377",5160,"it was not long before Peredur brought him to the ground, over his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1378",5160,"horse’s crupper.  Then the knight besought his mercy.  “Mercy thou shalt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1379",5160,"have,” said Peredur, “if thou wilt make oath to me, that thou wilt go to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1380",5160,"Arthur’s Court, and tell him that it was I that overthrew thee, for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1381",5160,"honour of his service; and say, that I will never come to the Court until","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1382",5160,"I have avenged the insult offered to the dwarf and dwarfess.”  The knight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1383",5160,"pledged him his faith of this, and proceeded to the Court of Arthur, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1384",5160,"said as he had promised, and conveyed the threat to Kai.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1385",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1386",5160,"And Peredur rode forward.  And within that week he encountered sixteen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1387",5160,"knights, and overthrew them all shamefully.  And they all went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1388",5160,"Arthur’s Court, taking with them the same message which the first knight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1389",5160,"had conveyed from Peredur, and the same threat which he had sent to Kai.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1390",5160,"And thereupon Kai was reproved by Arthur; and Kai was greatly grieved","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1391",5160,"thereat.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1392",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1393",5160,"And Peredur rode forward.  And he came to a vast and desert wood, on the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1394",5160,"confines of which was a lake.  And on the other side was a fair castle.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1395",5160,"And on the border of the lake he saw a venerable, hoary-headed man,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1396",5160,"sitting upon a velvet cushion, and having a garment of velvet upon him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1397",5160,"And his attendants were fishing in the lake.  When the hoary-headed man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1398",5160,"beheld Peredur approaching, he arose and went towards the castle.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1399",5160,"the old man was lame.  Peredur rode to the palace, and the door was open,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1400",5160,"and he entered the hall.  And there was the hoary-headed man sitting on a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1401",5160,"cushion, and a large blazing fire burning before him.  And the household","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1402",5160,"and the company arose to meet Peredur, and disarrayed him.  And the man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1403",5160,"asked the youth to sit on the cushion; and they sat down, and conversed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1404",5160,"together.  When it was time, the tables were laid, and they went to meat.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1405",5160,"And when they had finished their meal, the man inquired of Peredur if he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1406",5160,"knew well how to fight with the sword.  “I know not,” said Peredur, “but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1407",5160,"were I to be taught, doubtless I should.”  “Whoever can play well with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1408",5160,"the cudgel and shield, will also be able to fight with a sword.”  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1409",5160,"man had two sons; the one had yellow hair, and the other auburn.  “Arise,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1410",5160,"youths,” said he, “and play with the cudgel and the shield.”  And so did","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1411",5160,"they.  “Tell me, my soul,” said the man, “which of the youths thinkest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1412",5160,"thou plays best.”  “I think,” said Peredur, “that the yellow-haired youth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1413",5160,"could draw blood from the other, if he chose.”  “Arise thou, my life, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1414",5160,"take the cudgel and the shield from the hand of the youth with the auburn","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1415",5160,"hair, and draw blood from the yellow-haired youth if thou canst.”  So","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1416",5160,"Peredur arose, and went to play with the yellow-haired youth; and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1417",5160,"lifted up his arm, and struck him such a mighty blow, that his brow fell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1418",5160,"over his eye, and the blood flowed forth.  “Ah, my life,” said the man,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1419",5160,"“come now, and sit down, for thou wilt become the best fighter with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1420",5160,"sword of any in this island; and I am thy uncle, thy mother’s brother.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1421",5160,"And with me shalt thou remain a space, in order to learn the manners and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1422",5160,"customs of different countries, and courtesy, and gentleness, and noble","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1423",5160,"bearing.  Leave, then, the habits and the discourse of thy mother, and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1424",5160,"will be thy teacher; and I will raise thee to the rank of knight from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1425",5160,"this time forward.  And thus do thou.  If thou seest aught to cause thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1426",5160,"wonder, ask not the meaning of it; if no one has the courtesy to inform","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1427",5160,"thee, the reproach will not fall upon thee, but upon me that am thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1428",5160,"teacher.”  And they had abundance of honour and service.  And when it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1429",5160,"time they went to sleep.  At the break of day, Peredur arose, and took","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1430",5160,"his horse, and with his uncle’s permission he rode forth.  And he came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1431",5160,"a vast desert wood, and at the further end of the wood was a meadow, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1432",5160,"on the other side of the meadow he saw a large castle.  And thitherward","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1433",5160,"Peredur bent his way, and he found the gate open, and he proceeded to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1434",5160,"hall.  And he beheld a stately hoary-headed man sitting on one side of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1435",5160,"the hall, and many pages around him, who arose to receive and to honour","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1436",5160,"Peredur.  And they placed him by the side of the owner of the palace.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1437",5160,"Then they discoursed together; and when it was time to eat, they caused","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1438",5160,"Peredur to sit beside the nobleman during the repast.  And when they had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1439",5160,"eaten and drunk as much as they desired, the nobleman asked Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1440",5160,"whether he could fight with a sword?  “Were I to receive instruction,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1441",5160,"said Peredur, “I think I could.”  Now, there was on the floor of the hall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1442",5160,"a huge staple, as large as a warrior could grasp.  “Take yonder sword,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1443",5160,"said the man to Peredur, “and strike the iron staple.”  So Peredur arose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1444",5160,"and struck the staple, so that he cut it in two; and the sword broke into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1445",5160,"two parts also.  “Place the two parts together, and reunite them,” and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1446",5160,"Peredur placed them together, and they became entire as they were before.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1447",5160,"And a second time he struck upon the staple, so that both it and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1448",5160,"sword broke in two, and as before they reunited.  And the third time he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1449",5160,"gave a like blow, and placed the broken parts together, and neither the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1450",5160,"staple nor the sword would unite as before.  “Youth,” said the nobleman,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1451",5160,"“come now, and sit down, and my blessing be upon thee.  Thou fightest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1452",5160,"best with the sword of any man in the kingdom.  Thou hast arrived at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1453",5160,"two-thirds of thy strength, and the other third thou hast not yet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1454",5160,"obtained; and when thou attainest to thy full power, none will be able to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1455",5160,"contend with thee.  I am thy uncle, thy mother’s brother, and I am","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1456",5160,"brother to the man in whose house thou wast last night.”  Then Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1457",5160,"and his uncle discoursed together, and he beheld two youths enter the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1458",5160,"hall, and proceed up to the chamber, bearing a spear of mighty size, with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1459",5160,"three streams of blood flowing from the point to the ground.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1460",5160,"all the company saw this, they began wailing and lamenting.  But for all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1461",5160,"that, the man did not break off his discourse with Peredur.  And as he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1462",5160,"did not tell Peredur the meaning of what he saw, he forbore to ask him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1463",5160,"concerning it.  And when the clamour had a little subsided, behold two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1464",5160,"maidens entered, with a large salver between them, in which was a man’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1465",5160,"head, surrounded by a profusion of blood.  And thereupon the company of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1466",5160,"the court made so great an outcry, that it was irksome to be in the same","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1467",5160,"hall with them.  But at length they were silent.  And when time was that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1468",5160,"they should sleep, Peredur was brought into a fair chamber.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1469",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1470",5160,"And the next day, with his uncle’s permission, he rode forth.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1471",5160,"came to a wood, and far within the wood he heard a loud cry, and he saw a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1472",5160,"beautiful woman with auburn hair, and a horse with a saddle upon it,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1473",5160,"standing near her, and a corpse by her side.  And as she strove to place","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1474",5160,"the corpse upon the horse, it fell to the ground, and thereupon she made","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1475",5160,"a great lamentation.  “Tell me, sister,” said Peredur, “wherefore art","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1476",5160,"thou bewailing?”  “Oh! accursed Peredur, little pity has my ill-fortune","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1477",5160,"ever met with from thee.”  “Wherefore,” said Peredur, “am I accursed?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1478",5160,"“Because thou wast the cause of thy mother’s death; for when thou didst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1479",5160,"ride forth against her will, anguish seized upon her heart, so that she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1480",5160,"died; and therefore art thou accursed.  And the dwarf and the dwarfess","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1481",5160,"that thou sawest at Arthur’s Court were the dwarfs of thy father and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1482",5160,"mother; and I am thy foster-sister, and this was my wedded husband, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1483",5160,"he was slain by the knight that is in the glade in the wood; and do not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1484",5160,"thou go near him, lest thou shouldest be slain by him likewise.”  “My","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1485",5160,"sister, thou dost reproach me wrongfully; through my having so long","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1486",5160,"remained amongst you, I shall scarcely vanquish him; and had I continued","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1487",5160,"longer, it would, indeed, be difficult for me to succeed.  Cease,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1488",5160,"therefore, thy lamenting, for it is of no avail, and I will bury the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1489",5160,"body, and then I will go in quest of the knight, and see if I can do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1490",5160,"vengeance upon him.”  And when he had buried the body, they went to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1491",5160,"place where the knight was, and found him riding proudly along the glade;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1492",5160,"and he inquired of Peredur whence he came.  “I come from Arthur’s Court.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1493",5160,"“And art thou one of Arthur’s men?”  “Yes, by my faith.”  “A profitable","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1494",5160,"alliance, truly, is that of Arthur.”  And without further parlance, they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1495",5160,"encountered one another, and immediately Peredur overthrew the knight,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1496",5160,"and he besought mercy of Peredur.  “Mercy shalt thou have,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1497",5160,"“upon these terms, that thou take this woman in marriage, and do her all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1498",5160,"the honour and reverence in thy power, seeing thou hast, without cause,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1499",5160,"slain her wedded husband; and that thou go to Arthur’s Court, and shew","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1500",5160,"him that it was I that overthrew thee, to do him honour and service; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1501",5160,"that thou tell him that I will never come to his Court again until I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1502",5160,"met with the tall man that is there, to take vengeance upon him for his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1503",5160,"insult to the dwarf and dwarfess.”  And he took the knight’s assurance,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1504",5160,"that he would perform all this.  Then the knight provided the lady with a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1505",5160,"horse and garments that were suitable for her, and took her with him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1506",5160,"Arthur’s Court.  And he told Arthur all that had occurred, and gave the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1507",5160,"defiance to Kai.  And Arthur and all his household reproved Kai, for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1508",5160,"having driven such a youth as Peredur from his Court.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1509",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1510",5160,"Said Owain the son of Urien, “This youth will never come into the Court","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1511",5160,"until Kai has gone forth from it.”  “By my faith,” said Arthur, “I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1512",5160,"search all the deserts in the Island of Britain, until I find Peredur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1513",5160,"and then let him and his adversary do their utmost to each other.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1514",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1515",5160,"Then Peredur rode forward.  And he came to a desert wood, where he saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1516",5160,"not the track either of men or animals, and where there was nothing but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1517",5160,"bushes and weeds.  And at the upper end of the wood he saw a vast castle,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1518",5160,"wherein were many strong towers; and when he came near the gate, he found","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1519",5160,"the weeds taller than he had seen them elsewhere.  And he struck the gate","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1520",5160,"with the shaft of his lance, and thereupon behold a lean, auburn-haired","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1521",5160,"youth came to an opening in the battlements.  “Choose thou, chieftain,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1522",5160,"said he, “whether shall I open the gate unto thee, or shall I announce","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1523",5160,"unto those that are chief, that thou art at the gateway?”  “Say that I am","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1524",5160,"here,” said Peredur, “and if it is desired that I should enter, I will go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1525",5160,"in.”  And the youth came back, and opened the gate for Peredur.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1526",5160,"he went into the hall, he beheld eighteen youths, lean and red-headed, of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1527",5160,"the same height, and of the same aspect, and of the same dress, and of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1528",5160,"the same age as the one who had opened the gate for him.  And they were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1529",5160,"well skilled in courtesy and in service.  And they disarrayed him.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1530",5160,"they sat down to discourse.  Thereupon, behold five maidens came from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1531",5160,"chamber into the hall.  And Peredur was certain that he had never seen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1532",5160,"another of so fair an aspect as the chief of the maidens.  And she had an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1533",5160,"old garment of satin upon her, which had once been handsome, but was then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1534",5160,"so tattered, that her skin could be seen through it.  And whiter was her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1535",5160,"skin than the bloom of crystal, and her hair and her two eyebrows were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1536",5160,"blacker than jet, and on her cheeks were two red spots, redder than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1537",5160,"whatever is reddest.  And the maiden welcomed Peredur, and put her arms","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1538",5160,"about his neck, and made him sit down beside her.  Not long after this he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1539",5160,"saw two nuns enter, and a flask full of wine was borne by one, and six","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1540",5160,"loaves of white bread by the other.  “Lady,” said they, “Heaven is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1541",5160,"witness, that there is not so much of food and liquor as this left in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1542",5160,"yonder Convent this night.”  Then they went to meat, and Peredur observed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1543",5160,"that the maiden wished to give more of the food and of the liquor to him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1544",5160,"than to any of the others.  “My sister,” said Peredur, “I will share out","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1545",5160,"the food and the liquor.”  “Not so, my soul,” said she.  “By my faith but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1546",5160,"I will.”  So Peredur took the bread, and he gave an equal portion of it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1547",5160,"to each alike, as well as a cup full of the liquor.  And when it was time","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1548",5160,"for them to sleep, a chamber was prepared for Peredur, and he went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1549",5160,"rest.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1550",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1551",5160,"“Behold, sister,” said the youths to the fairest and most exalted of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1552",5160,"maidens, “we have counsel for thee.”  “What may it be?” she inquired.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1553",5160,"“Go to the youth that is in the upper chamber, and offer to become his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1554",5160,"wife, or the lady of his love, if it seem well to him.”  “That were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1555",5160,"indeed unfitting,” said she.  “Hitherto I have not been the lady-love of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1556",5160,"any knight, and to make him such an offer before I am wooed by him, that,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1557",5160,"truly, can I not do.”  “By our confession to Heaven, unless thou actest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1558",5160,"thus, we will leave thee here to thy enemies, to do as they will with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1559",5160,"thee.”  And through fear of this, the maiden went forth; and shedding","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1560",5160,"tears, she proceeded to the chamber.  And with the noise of the door","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1561",5160,"opening, Peredur awoke; and the maiden was weeping and lamenting.  “Tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1562",5160,"me, my sister,” said Peredur, “wherefore dost thou weep?”  “I will tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1563",5160,"thee, lord,” said she.  “My father possessed these dominions as their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1564",5160,"chief, and this palace was his, and with it he held the best earldom in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1565",5160,"the kingdom; then the son of another earl sought me of my father, and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1566",5160,"was not willing to be given unto him, and my father would not give me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1567",5160,"against my will, either to him or any earl in the world.  And my father","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1568",5160,"had no child except myself.  And after my father’s death, these dominions","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1569",5160,"came into my own hands, and then was I less willing to accept him than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1570",5160,"before.  So he made war upon me, and conquered all my possessions, except","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1571",5160,"this one house.  And through the valour of the men whom thou hast seen,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1572",5160,"who are my foster-brothers, and the strength of the house, it can never","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1573",5160,"be taken while food and drink remain.  And now our provisions are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1574",5160,"exhausted; but, as thou hast seen, we have been fed by the nuns, to whom","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1575",5160,"the country is free.  And at length they also are without supply of food","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1576",5160,"or liquor.  And at no later date than to-morrow, the earl will come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1577",5160,"against this place with all his forces; and if I fall into his power, my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1578",5160,"fate will be no better than to be given over to the grooms of his horses.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1579",5160,"Therefore, lord, I am come to offer to place myself in thy hands, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1580",5160,"thou mayest succour me, either by taking me hence, or by defending me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1581",5160,"here, whichever may seem best unto thee.”  “Go, my sister,” said he, “and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1582",5160,"sleep; nor will I depart from thee until I do that which thou requirest,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1583",5160,"or prove whether I can assist thee or not.”  The maiden went again to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1584",5160,"rest; and the next morning she came to Peredur, and saluted him.  “Heaven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1585",5160,"prosper thee, my soul, and what tidings dost thou bring?”  “None other,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1586",5160,"than that the earl and all his forces have alighted at the gate, and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1587",5160,"never beheld any place so covered with tents, and thronged with knights","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1588",5160,"challenging others to the combat.”  “Truly,” said Peredur, “let my horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1589",5160,"be made ready.”  So his horse was accoutred, and he arose and sallied","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1590",5160,"forth to the meadow.  And there was a knight riding proudly along the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1591",5160,"meadow, having raised the signal for battle.  And they encountered, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1592",5160,"Peredur threw the knight over his horse’s crupper to the ground.  And at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1593",5160,"the close of the day, one of the chief knights came to fight with him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1594",5160,"and he overthrew him also, so that he besought his mercy.  “Who art","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1595",5160,"thou?” said Peredur.  “Verily,” said he, “I am Master of the Household to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1596",5160,"the earl.”  “And how much of the countess’s possessions is there in thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1597",5160,"power?”  “The third part, verily,” answered he.  “Then,” said Peredur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1598",5160,"“restore to her the third of her possessions in full, and all the profit","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1599",5160,"thou hast made by them, and bring meat and drink for a hundred men, with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1600",5160,"their horses and arms, to her court this night.  And thou shalt remain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1601",5160,"her captive, unless she wish to take thy life.”  And this he did","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1602",5160,"forthwith.  And that night the maiden was right joyful, and they fared","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1603",5160,"plenteously.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1604",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1605",5160,"And the next day Peredur rode forth to the meadow; and that day he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1606",5160,"vanquished a multitude of the host.  And at the close of the day, there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1607",5160,"came a proud and stately knight, and Peredur overthrew him, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1608",5160,"besought his mercy.  “Who art thou?” said Peredur.  “I am Steward of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1609",5160,"Palace,” said he.  “And how much of the maiden’s possessions are under","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1610",5160,"thy control?”  “One-third part,” answered he.  “Verily,” said Peredur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1611",5160,"“thou shalt fully restore to the maiden her possessions, and, moreover,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1612",5160,"thou shalt give her meat and drink for two hundred men, and their horses","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1613",5160,"and their arms.  And for thyself, thou shalt be her captive.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1614",5160,"immediately it was so done.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1615",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1616",5160,"And the third day Peredur rode forth to the meadow; and he vanquished","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1617",5160,"more that day than on either of the preceding.  And at the close of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1618",5160,"day, an earl came to encounter him, and he overthrew him, and he besought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1619",5160,"his mercy.  “Who art thou?” said Peredur.  “I am the earl,” said he.  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1620",5160,"will not conceal it from thee.”  “Verily,” said Peredur, “thou shalt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1621",5160,"restore the whole of the maiden’s earldom, and shalt give her thine own","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1622",5160,"earldom in addition thereto, and meat and drink for three hundred men,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1623",5160,"and their horses and arms, and thou thyself shalt remain in her power.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1624",5160,"And thus it was fulfilled.  And Peredur tarried three weeks in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1625",5160,"country, causing tribute and obedience to be paid to the maiden, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1626",5160,"government to be placed in her hands.  “With thy leave,” said Peredur, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1627",5160,"will go hence.”  “Verily, my brother, desirest thou this?”  “Yes, by my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1628",5160,"faith; and had it not been for love of thee, I should not have been here","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1629",5160,"thus long.”  “My soul,” said she, “who art thou?”  “I am Peredur the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1630",5160,"of Evrawc from the North; and if ever thou art in trouble or in danger,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1631",5160,"acquaint me therewith, and if I can, I will protect thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1632",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1633",5160,"So Peredur rode forth.  And far thence there met him a lady, mounted on a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1634",5160,"horse that was lean, and covered with sweat; and she saluted the youth.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1635",5160,"“Whence comest thou, my sister?”  Then she told him the cause of her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1636",5160,"journey.  Now she was the wife of the Lord of the Glade.  “Behold,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1637",5160,"he, “I am the knight through whom thou art in trouble, and he shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1638",5160,"repent it, who has treated thee thus.”  Thereupon, behold a knight rode","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1639",5160,"up, and he inquired of Peredur, if he had seen a knight such as he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1640",5160,"seeking.  “Hold thy peace,” said Peredur, “I am he whom thou seekest; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1641",5160,"by my faith, thou deservest ill of thy household for thy treatment of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1642",5160,"maiden, for she is innocent concerning me.”  So they encountered, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1643",5160,"they were not long in combat ere Peredur overthrew the knight, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1644",5160,"besought his mercy.  “Mercy thou shalt have,” said Peredur, “so thou wilt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1645",5160,"return by the way thou camest, and declare that thou holdest the maiden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1646",5160,"innocent, and so that thou wilt acknowledge unto her the reverse thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1647",5160,"hast sustained at my hands.”  And the knight plighted him his faith","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1648",5160,"thereto.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1649",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1650",5160,"Then Peredur rode forward.  And above him he beheld a castle, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1651",5160,"thitherward he went.  And he struck upon the gate with his lance, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1652",5160,"then, behold, a comely auburn-haired youth opened the gate, and he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1653",5160,"the stature of a warrior, and the years of a boy.  And when Peredur came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1654",5160,"into the hall, there was a tall and stately lady sitting in a chair, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1655",5160,"many handmaidens around her; and the lady rejoiced at his coming.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1656",5160,"when it was time, they went to meat.  And after their repast was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1657",5160,"finished, “It were well for thee, chieftain,” said she, “to go elsewhere","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1658",5160,"to sleep.”  “Wherefore can I not sleep here?” said Peredur.  “Nine","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1659",5160,"sorceresses are here, my soul, of the sorceresses of Gloucester, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1660",5160,"their father and their mother are with them; and unless we can make our","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1661",5160,"escape before daybreak, we shall be slain; and already they have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1662",5160,"conquered and laid waste all the country, except this one dwelling.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1663",5160,"“Behold,” said Peredur, “I will remain here to-night, and if you are in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1664",5160,"trouble, I will do you what service I can; but harm shall you not receive","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1665",5160,"from me.”  So they went to rest.  And with the break of day, Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1666",5160,"heard a dreadful outcry.  And he hastily arose, and went forth in his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1667",5160,"vest and his doublet, with his sword about his neck, and he saw a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1668",5160,"sorceress overtake one of the watch, who cried out violently.  Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1669",5160,"attacked the sorceress, and struck her upon the head with his sword, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1670",5160,"that he flattened her helmet and her head-piece like a dish upon her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1671",5160,"head.  “Thy mercy, goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc, and the mercy of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1672",5160,"Heaven.”  “How knowest thou, hag, that I am Peredur?”  “By destiny, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1673",5160,"the foreknowledge that I should suffer harm from thee.  And thou shalt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1674",5160,"take a horse and armour of me; and with me thou shalt go to learn","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1675",5160,"chivalry and the use of thy arms.”  Said Peredur, “Thou shalt have mercy,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1676",5160,"if thou pledge thy faith thou wilt never more injure the dominions of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1677",5160,"Countess.”  And Peredur took surety of this, and with permission of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1678",5160,"Countess, he set forth with the sorceress to the palace of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1679",5160,"sorceresses.  And there he remained for three weeks, and then he made","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1680",5160,"choice of a horse and arms, and went his way.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1681",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1682",5160,"And in the evening he entered a valley, and at the head of the valley he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1683",5160,"came to a hermit’s cell, and the hermit welcomed him gladly, and there he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1684",5160,"spent the night.  And in the morning he arose, and when he went forth,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1685",5160,"behold a shower of snow had fallen the night before, and a hawk had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1686",5160,"killed a wild fowl in front of the cell.  And the noise of the horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1687",5160,"scared the hawk away, and a raven alighted upon the bird.  And Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1688",5160,"stood, and compared the blackness of the raven and the whiteness of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1689",5160,"snow, and the redness of the blood, to the hair of the lady that best he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1690",5160,"loved, which was blacker than jet, and to her skin which was whiter than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1691",5160,"the snow, and to the two red spots upon her cheeks, which were redder","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1692",5160,"than the blood upon the snow appeared to be.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1693",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1694",5160,"Now Arthur and his household were in search of Peredur.  “Know ye,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1695",5160,"Arthur, “who is the knight with the long spear that stands by the brook","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1696",5160,"up yonder?”  “Lord,” said one of them, “I will go and learn who he is.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1697",5160,"So the youth came to the place where Peredur was, and asked him what he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1698",5160,"did thus, and who he was.  And from the intensity with which he thought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1699",5160,"upon the lady whom best he loved, he gave him no answer.  Then the youth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1700",5160,"thrust at Peredur with his lance, and Peredur turned upon him, and struck","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1701",5160,"him over his horse’s crupper to the ground.  And after this,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1702",5160,"four-and-twenty youths came to him, and he did not answer one more than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1703",5160,"another, but gave the same reception to all, bringing them with one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1704",5160,"single thrust to the ground.  And then came Kai, and spoke to Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1705",5160,"rudely and angrily; and Peredur took him with his lance under the jaw,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1706",5160,"and cast him from him with a thrust, so that he broke his arm and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1707",5160,"shoulder-blade, and he rode over him one-and-twenty times.  And while he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1708",5160,"lay thus, stunned with the violence of the pain that he had suffered, his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1709",5160,"horse returned back at a wild and prancing pace.  And when the household","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1710",5160,"saw the horse come back without his rider, they rode forth in haste to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1711",5160,"the place where the encounter had been.  And when they first came there,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1712",5160,"they thought that Kai was slain; but they found that if he had a skilful","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1713",5160,"physician, he yet might live.  And Peredur moved not from his meditation,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1714",5160,"on seeing the concourse that was around Kai.  And Kai was brought to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1715",5160,"Arthur’s tent, and Arthur caused skilful physicians to come to him.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1716",5160,"Arthur was grieved that Kai had met with this reverse, for he loved him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1717",5160,"greatly.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1718",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1719",5160,"“Then,” said Gwalchmai, “it is not fitting that any should disturb an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1720",5160,"honourable knight from his thought unadvisedly; for either he is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1721",5160,"pondering some damage that he has sustained, or he is thinking of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1722",5160,"lady whom best he loves.  And through such ill-advised proceeding,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1723",5160,"perchance this misadventure has befallen him who last met with him.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1724",5160,"if it seem well to thee, lord, I will go and see if this knight hath","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1725",5160,"changed from his thought; and if he has, I will ask him courteously to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1726",5160,"come and visit thee.”  Then Kai was wroth, and he spoke angry and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1727",5160,"spiteful words.  “Gwalchmai,” said he, “I know that thou wilt bring him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1728",5160,"because he is fatigued.  Little praise and honour, nevertheless, wilt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1729",5160,"thou have from vanquishing a weary knight, who is tired with fighting.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1730",5160,"Yet thus hast thou gained the advantage over many.  And while thy speech","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1731",5160,"and thy soft words last, a coat of thin linen were armour sufficient for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1732",5160,"thee, and thou wilt not need to break either lance or sword in fighting","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1733",5160,"with the knight in the state he is in.”  Then said Gwalchmai to Kai,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1734",5160,"“Thou mightest use more pleasant words, wert thou so minded: and it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1735",5160,"behoves thee not upon me to wreak thy wrath and thy displeasure.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1736",5160,"Methinks I shall bring the knight hither with me without breaking either","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1737",5160,"my arm or my shoulder.”  Then said Arthur to Gwalchmai, “Thou speakest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1738",5160,"like a wise and prudent man; go, and take enough of armour about thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1739",5160,"and choose thy horse.”  And Gwalchmai accoutred himself and rode forward","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1740",5160,"hastily to the place where Peredur was.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1741",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1742",5160,"And Peredur was resting on the shaft of his spear, pondering the same","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1743",5160,"thought, and Gwalchmai came to him without any signs of hostility, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1744",5160,"said to him, “If I thought that it would be as agreeable to thee as it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1745",5160,"would be to me, I would converse with thee.  I have also a message from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1746",5160,"Arthur unto thee, to pray thee to come and visit him.  And two men have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1747",5160,"been before on this errand.”  “That is true,” said Peredur, “and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1748",5160,"uncourteously they came.  They attacked me, and I was annoyed thereat,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1749",5160,"for it was not pleasing to me to be drawn from the thought that I was in,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1750",5160,"for I was thinking of the lady whom best I love, and thus was she brought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1751",5160,"to my mind:—I was looking upon the snow, and upon the raven, and upon the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1752",5160,"drops of the blood of the bird that the hawk had killed upon the snow.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1753",5160,"And I bethought me that her whiteness was like that of the snow, and that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1754",5160,"the blackness of her hair and her eyebrows like that of the raven, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1755",5160,"that the two red spots upon her cheeks were like the two drops of blood.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1756",5160,"Said Gwalchmai, “This was not an ungentle thought, and I should marvel if","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1757",5160,"it were pleasant to thee to be drawn from it.”  “Tell me,” said Peredur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1758",5160,"“is Kai in Arthur’s Court?”  “He is,” said he, “and behold he is the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1759",5160,"knight that fought with thee last; and it would have been better for him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1760",5160,"had he not come, for his arm and his shoulder-blade were broken with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1761",5160,"fall which he had from thy spear.”  “Verily,” said Peredur, “I am not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1762",5160,"sorry to have thus begun to avenge the insult to the dwarf and dwarfess.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1763",5160,"Then Gwalchmai marvelled to hear him speak of the dwarf and the dwarfess;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1764",5160,"and he approached him, and threw his arms around his neck, and asked him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1765",5160,"what was his name.  “Peredur the son of Evrawc am I called,” said he;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1766",5160,"“and thou, Who art thou?”  “I am called Gwalchmai,” he replied.  “I am","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1767",5160,"right glad to meet with thee,” said Peredur, “for in every country where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1768",5160,"I have been I have heard of thy fame for prowess and uprightness, and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1769",5160,"solicit thy fellowship.”  “Thou shalt have it, by my faith, and grant me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1770",5160,"thine,” said he, “Gladly will I do so,” answered Peredur.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1771",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1772",5160,"So they rode forth together joyfully towards the place where Arthur was,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1773",5160,"and when Kai saw them coming, he said, “I knew that Gwalchmai needed not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1774",5160,"to fight the knight.  And it is no wonder that he should gain fame; more","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1775",5160,"can he do by his fair words than I by the strength of my arm.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1776",5160,"Peredur went with Gwalchmai to his tent, and they took off their armour.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1777",5160,"And Peredur put on garments like those that Gwalchmai wore, and they went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1778",5160,"together unto Arthur, and saluted him.  “Behold, lord,” said Gwalchmai,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1779",5160,"“him whom thou hast sought so long.”  “Welcome unto thee, chieftain,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1780",5160,"said Arthur.  “With me thou shalt remain; and had I known thy valour had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1781",5160,"been such, thou shouldst not have left me as thou didst; nevertheless,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1782",5160,"this was predicted of thee by the dwarf and the dwarfess, whom Kai","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1783",5160,"ill-treated and whom thou hast avenged.”  And hereupon, behold there came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1784",5160,"the Queen and her handmaidens, and Peredur saluted them.  And they were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1785",5160,"rejoiced to see him, and bade him welcome.  And Arthur did him great","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1786",5160,"honour and respect, and they returned towards Caerlleon.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1787",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1788",5160,"And the first night Peredur came to Caerlleon to Arthur’s Court, and as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1789",5160,"he walked in the city after his repast, behold, there met him Angharad","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1790",5160,"Law Eurawc.  “By my faith, sister,” said Peredur, “thou art a beauteous","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1791",5160,"and lovely maiden; and, were it pleasing to thee, I could love thee above","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1792",5160,"all women.”  “I pledge my faith,” said she, “that I do not love thee, nor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1793",5160,"will I ever do so.”  “I also pledge my faith,” said Peredur, “that I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1794",5160,"never speak a word to any Christian again, until thou come to love me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1795",5160,"above all men.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1796",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1797",5160,"The next day Peredur went forth by the high road, along a mountain-ridge,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1798",5160,"and he saw a valley of a circular form, the confines of which were rocky","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1799",5160,"and wooded.  And the flat part of the valley was in meadows, and there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1800",5160,"were fields betwixt the meadows and the wood.  And in the bosom of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1801",5160,"wood he saw large black houses of uncouth workmanship.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1802",5160,"dismounted, and led his horse towards the wood.  And a little way within","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1803",5160,"the wood he saw a rocky ledge, along which the road lay.  And upon the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1804",5160,"ledge was a lion bound by a chain, and sleeping.  And beneath the lion he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1805",5160,"saw a deep pit of immense size, full of the bones of men and animals.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1806",5160,"And Peredur drew his sword and struck the lion, so that he fell into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1807",5160,"mouth of the pit and hung there by the chain; and with a second blow he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1808",5160,"struck the chain and broke it, and the lion fell into the pit; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1809",5160,"Peredur led his horse over the rocky ledge, until he came into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1810",5160,"valley.  And in the centre of the valley he saw a fair castle, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1811",5160,"went towards it.  And in the meadow by the castle he beheld a huge grey","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1812",5160,"man sitting, who was larger than any man he had ever before seen.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1813",5160,"two young pages were shooting the hilts of their daggers, of the bone of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1814",5160,"the sea-horse.  And one of the pages had red hair, and the other auburn.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1815",5160,"And they went before him to the place where the grey man was, and Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1816",5160,"saluted him.  And the grey man said, “Disgrace to the beard of my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1817",5160,"porter.”  Then Peredur understood that the porter was the lion.—And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1818",5160,"grey man and the pages went together into the castle, and Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1819",5160,"accompanied them; and he found it a fair and noble place.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1820",5160,"proceeded to the hall, and the tables were already laid, and upon them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1821",5160,"was abundance of food and liquor.  And thereupon he saw an aged woman and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1822",5160,"a young woman come from the chamber; and they were the most stately women","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1823",5160,"he had ever seen.  Then they washed and went to meat, and the grey man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1824",5160,"sat in the upper seat at the head of the table, and the aged woman next","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1825",5160,"to him.  And Peredur and the maiden were placed together, and the two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1826",5160,"young pages served them.  And the maiden gazed sorrowfully upon Peredur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1827",5160,"and Peredur asked the maiden wherefore she was sad.  “For thee, my soul;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1828",5160,"for, from when I first beheld thee, I have loved thee above all men.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1829",5160,"it pains me to know that so gentle a youth as thou should have such a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1830",5160,"doom as awaits thee to-morrow.  Sawest thou the numerous black houses in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1831",5160,"the bosom of the wood?  All these belong to the vassals of the grey man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1832",5160,"yonder, who is my father.  And they are all giants.  And to-morrow they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1833",5160,"will rise up against thee, and will slay thee.  And the Round Valley is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1834",5160,"this valley called.”  “Listen, fair maiden, wilt thou contrive that my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1835",5160,"horse and arms be in the same lodging with me to-night?”  “Gladly will I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1836",5160,"cause it so to be, by Heaven, if I can.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1837",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1838",5160,"And when it was time for them to sleep rather than to carouse, they went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1839",5160,"to rest.  And the maiden caused Peredur’s horse and arms to be in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1840",5160,"same lodging with him.  And the next morning Peredur heard a great tumult","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1841",5160,"of men and horses around the castle.  And Peredur arose, and armed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1842",5160,"himself and his horse, and went to the meadow.  Then the aged woman and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1843",5160,"the maiden came to the grey man: “Lord,” said they, “take the word of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1844",5160,"youth, that he will never disclose what he has seen in this place, and we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1845",5160,"will be his sureties that he keep it.”  “I will not do so, by my faith,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1846",5160,"said the grey man.  So Peredur fought with the host, and towards evening","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1847",5160,"he had slain the one-third of them without receiving any hurt himself.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1848",5160,"Then said the aged woman, “Behold, many of thy host have been slain by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1849",5160,"the youth; do thou, therefore, grant him mercy.”  “I will not grant it,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1850",5160,"by my faith,” said he.  And the aged woman and the fair maiden were upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1851",5160,"the battlements of the castle, looking forth.  And at that juncture,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1852",5160,"Peredur encountered the yellow-haired youth and slew him.  “Lord,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1853",5160,"the maiden, “grant the young man mercy.”  “That will I not do, by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1854",5160,"Heaven,” he replied; and thereupon Peredur attacked the auburn-haired","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1855",5160,"youth, and slew him likewise.  “It were better that thou hadst accorded","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1856",5160,"mercy to the youth before he had slain thy two sons; for now scarcely","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1857",5160,"wilt thou thyself escape from him.”  “Go, maiden, and beseech the youth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1858",5160,"to grant mercy unto us, for we yield ourselves into his hands.”  So the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1859",5160,"maiden came to the place where Peredur was, and besought mercy for her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1860",5160,"father, and for all such of his vassals as had escaped alive.  “Thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1861",5160,"shalt have it, on condition that thy father and all that are under him go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1862",5160,"and render homage to Arthur, and tell him that it was his vassal Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1863",5160,"that did him this service.”  “This will we do willingly, by Heaven.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1864",5160,"“And you shall also receive baptism; and I will send to Arthur, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1865",5160,"beseech him to bestow this valley upon thee and upon thy heirs after thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1866",5160,"for ever.”  Then they went in, and the grey man and the tall woman","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1867",5160,"saluted Peredur.  And the grey man said unto him, “Since I have possessed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1868",5160,"this valley I have not seen any Christian depart with his life, save","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1869",5160,"thyself.  And we will go to do homage to Arthur, and to embrace the faith","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1870",5160,"and be baptized.”  Then said Peredur, “To Heaven I render thanks that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1871",5160,"have not broken my vow to the lady that best I love, which was, that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1872",5160,"would not speak one word unto any Christian.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1873",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1874",5160,"That night they tarried there.  And the next day, in the morning, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1875",5160,"grey man, with his company, set forth to Arthur’s Court; and they did","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1876",5160,"homage unto Arthur, and he caused them to be baptized.  And the grey man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1877",5160,"told Arthur that it was Peredur that had vanquished them.  And Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1878",5160,"gave the valley to the grey man and his company, to hold it of him as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1879",5160,"Peredur had besought.  And with Arthur’s permission, the grey man went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1880",5160,"back to the Round Valley.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1881",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1882",5160,"Peredur rode forward next day, and he traversed a vast tract of desert,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1883",5160,"in which no dwellings were.  And at length he came to a habitation, mean","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1884",5160,"and small.  And there he heard that there was a serpent that lay upon a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1885",5160,"gold ring, and suffered none to inhabit the country for seven miles","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1886",5160,"around.  And Peredur came to the place where he heard the serpent was.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1887",5160,"And angrily, furiously, and desperately fought he with the serpent; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1888",5160,"at last he killed it, and took away the ring.  And thus he was for a long","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1889",5160,"time without speaking a word to any Christian.  And therefrom he lost his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1890",5160,"colour and his aspect, through extreme longing after the Court of Arthur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1891",5160,"and the society of the lady whom best he loved, and of his companions.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1892",5160,"Then he proceeded forward to Arthur’s Court, and on the road there met","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1893",5160,"him Arthur’s household going on a particular errand, with Kai at their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1894",5160,"head.  And Peredur knew them all, but none of the household recognized","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1895",5160,"him.  “Whence comest thou, chieftain?” said Kai.  And this he asked him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1896",5160,"twice and three times, and he answered him not.  And Kai thrust him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1897",5160,"through the thigh with his lance.  And lest he should be compelled to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1898",5160,"speak, and to break his vow, he went on without stopping.  “Then,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1899",5160,"Gwalchmai, “I declare to Heaven, Kai, that thou hast acted ill in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1900",5160,"committing such an outrage on a youth like this, who cannot speak.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1901",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1902",5160,"And Gwalchmai returned back to Arthur’s Court.  “Lady,” said he to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1903",5160,"Gwenhwyvar, “seest thou how wicked an outrage Kai has committed upon this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1904",5160,"youth who cannot speak; for Heaven’s sake, and for mine, cause him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1905",5160,"have medical care before I come back, and I will repay thee the charge.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1906",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1907",5160,"And before the men returned from their errand, a knight came to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1908",5160,"meadow beside Arthur’s Palace, to dare some one to the encounter.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1909",5160,"his challenge was accepted; and Peredur fought with him, and overthrew","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1910",5160,"him.  And for a week he overthrew one knight every day.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1911",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1912",5160,"And one day, Arthur and his household were going to Church, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1913",5160,"beheld a knight who had raised the signal for combat.  “Verily,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1914",5160,"Arthur, “by the valour of men, I will not go hence until I have my horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1915",5160,"and my arms to overthrow yonder boor.”  Then went the attendants to fetch","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1916",5160,"Arthur’s horse and arms.  And Peredur met the attendants as they were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1917",5160,"going back, and he took the horse and arms from them, and proceeded to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1918",5160,"the meadow; and all those who saw him arise and go to do battle with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1919",5160,"knight, went upon the tops of the houses, and the mounds, and the high","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1920",5160,"places, to behold the combat.  And Peredur beckoned with his hand to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1921",5160,"knight to commence the fight.  And the knight thrust at him, but he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1922",5160,"not thereby moved from where he stood.  And Peredur spurred his horse,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1923",5160,"and ran at him wrathfully, furiously, fiercely, desperately, and with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1924",5160,"mighty rage, and he gave him a thrust, deadly-wounding, severe, furious,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1925",5160,"adroit, and strong, under his jaw, and raised him out of his saddle, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1926",5160,"cast him a long way from him.  And Peredur went back, and left the horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1927",5160,"and the arms with the attendant as before, and he went on foot to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1928",5160,"Palace.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1929",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1930",5160,"Then Peredur went by the name of the Dumb Youth.  And behold, Angharad","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1931",5160,"Law Eurawc met him.  “I declare to Heaven, chieftain,” said she, “woful","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1932",5160,"is it that thou canst not speak; for couldst thou speak, I would love","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1933",5160,"thee best of all men; and by my faith, although thou canst not, I do love","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1934",5160,"thee above all.”  “Heaven reward thee, my sister,” said Peredur, “by my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1935",5160,"faith I also do love thee.”  Thereupon it was known that he was Peredur.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1936",5160,"And then he held fellowship with Gwalchmai, and Owain the son of Urien,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1937",5160,"and all the household, and he remained in Arthur’s Court.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1938",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"1940",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1941",5160,"Arthur was in Caerlleon upon Usk; and he went to hunt, and Peredur went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1942",5160,"with him.  And Peredur let loose his dog upon a hart, and the dog killed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1943",5160,"the hart in a desert place.  And a short space from him he saw signs of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1944",5160,"dwelling, and towards the dwelling he went, and he beheld a hall, and at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1945",5160,"the door of the hall he found bald swarthy youths playing at chess.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1946",5160,"when he entered, he beheld three maidens sitting on a bench, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1947",5160,"were all clothed alike, as became persons of high rank.  And he came, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1948",5160,"sat by them upon the bench; and one of the maidens looked steadfastly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1949",5160,"upon Peredur, and wept.  And Peredur asked her wherefore she was weeping.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1950",5160,"“Through grief, that I should see so fair a youth as thou art, slain.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1951",5160,"“Who will slay me?” inquired Peredur.  “If thou art so daring as to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1952",5160,"remain here to-night, I will tell thee.”  “How great soever my danger may","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1953",5160,"be from remaining here, I will listen unto thee.”  “This Palace is owned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1954",5160,"by him who is my father,” said the maiden, “and he slays every one who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1955",5160,"comes hither without his leave.”  “What sort of a man is thy father, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1956",5160,"he is able to slay every one thus?”  “A man who does violence and wrong","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1957",5160,"unto his neighbours, and who renders justice unto none.”  And hereupon he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1958",5160,"saw the youths arise and clear the chessmen from the board.  And he heard","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1959",5160,"a great tumult; and after the tumult there came in a huge black one-eyed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1960",5160,"man, and the maidens arose to meet him.  And they disarrayed him, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1961",5160,"went and sat down; and after he had rested and pondered awhile, he looked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1962",5160,"at Peredur, and asked who the knight was.  “Lord,” said one of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1963",5160,"maidens, “he is the fairest and gentlest youth that ever thou didst see.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1964",5160,"And for the sake of Heaven, and of thine own dignity, have patience with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1965",5160,"him.”  “For thy sake I will have patience, and I will grant him his life","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1966",5160,"this night.”  Then Peredur came towards them to the fire, and partook of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1967",5160,"food and liquor, and entered into discourse with the ladies.  And being","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1968",5160,"elated with the liquor, he said to the black man, “It is a marvel to me,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1969",5160,"so mighty as thou sayest thou art, who could have put out thine eye.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1970",5160,"“It is one of my habits,” said the black man, “that whosoever puts to me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1971",5160,"the question which thou hast asked, shall not escape with his life,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1972",5160,"either as a free gift or for a price.”  “Lord,” said the maiden,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1973",5160,"“whatsoever he may say to thee in jest, and through the excitement of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1974",5160,"liquor, make good that which thou saidst and didst promise me just now.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1975",5160,"“I will do so, gladly, for thy sake,” said he.  “Willingly will I grant","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1976",5160,"him his life this night.”  And that night thus they remained.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1977",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1978",5160,"And the next day the black man got up, and put on his armour, and said to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1979",5160,"Peredur, “Arise, man, and suffer death.”  And Peredur said unto him, “Do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1980",5160,"one of two things, black man; if thou wilt fight with me, either throw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1981",5160,"off thy own armour, or give arms to me, that I may encounter thee.”  “Ha,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1982",5160,"man,” said he, “couldst thou fight, if thou hadst arms?  Take, then, what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1983",5160,"arms thou dost choose.”  And thereupon the maiden came to Peredur with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1984",5160,"such arms as pleased him; and he fought with the black man, and forced","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1985",5160,"him to crave his mercy.  “Black man, thou shalt have mercy, provided thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1986",5160,"tell me who thou art, and who put out thine eye.”  “Lord, I will tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1987",5160,"thee; I lost it in fighting with the Black Serpent of the Carn.  There is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1988",5160,"a mound, which is called the Mound of Mourning; and on the mound there is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1989",5160,"a carn, and in the carn there is a serpent, and on the tail of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1990",5160,"serpent there is a stone, and the virtues of the stone are such, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1991",5160,"whosoever should hold it in one hand, in the other he will have as much","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1992",5160,"gold as he may desire.  And in fighting with this serpent was it that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1993",5160,"lost my eye.  And the Black Oppressor am I called.  And for this reason I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1994",5160,"am called the Black Oppressor, that there is not a single man around me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1995",5160,"whom I have not oppressed, and justice have I done unto none.”  “Tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1996",5160,"me,” said Peredur, “how far is it hence?”  “The same day that thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1997",5160,"settest forth, thou wilt come to the Palace of the Sons of the King of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1998",5160,"the Tortures.”  “Wherefore are they called thus?”  “The Addanc of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"1999",5160,"Lake slays them once every day.  When thou goest thence, thou wilt come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2000",5160,"to the Court of the Countess of the Achievements.”  “What achievements","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2001",5160,"are there?” asked Peredur.  “Three hundred men there are in her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2002",5160,"household, and unto every stranger that comes to the Court, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2003",5160,"achievements of her household are related.  And this is the manner of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2004",5160,"it,—the three hundred men of the household sit next unto the Lady; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2005",5160,"that not through disrespect unto the guests, but that they may relate the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2006",5160,"achievements of the household.  And the day that thou goest thence, thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2007",5160,"wilt reach the Mound of Mourning, and round about the mound there are the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2008",5160,"owners of three hundred tents guarding the serpent.”  “Since thou hast,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2009",5160,"indeed, been an oppressor so long,” said Peredur, “I will cause that thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2010",5160,"continue so no longer.”  So he slew him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2011",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2012",5160,"Then the maiden spoke, and began to converse with him.  “If thou wast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2013",5160,"poor when thou camest here, henceforth thou wilt be rich through the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2014",5160,"treasure of the black man whom thou hast slain.  Thou seest the many","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2015",5160,"lovely maidens that there are in this Court; thou shalt have her whom","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2016",5160,"thou best likest for the lady of thy love.”  “Lady, I came not hither","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2017",5160,"from my country to woo; but match yourselves as it liketh you with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2018",5160,"comely youths I see here; and none of your goods do I desire, for I need","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2019",5160,"them not.”  Then Peredur rode forward, and he came to the Palace of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2020",5160,"Sons of the King of the Tortures; and when he entered the Palace, he saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2021",5160,"none but women; and they rose up, and were joyful at his coming; and as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2022",5160,"they began to discourse with him, he beheld a charger arrive, with a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2023",5160,"saddle upon it, and a corpse in the saddle.  And one of the women arose,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2024",5160,"and took the corpse from the saddle, and anointed it in a vessel of warm","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2025",5160,"water, which was below the door, and placed precious balsam upon it; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2026",5160,"the man rose up alive, and came to the place where Peredur was, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2027",5160,"greeted him, and was joyful to see him.  And two other men came in upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2028",5160,"their saddles, and the maiden treated these two in the same manner as she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2029",5160,"had done the first.  Then Peredur asked the chieftain wherefore it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2030",5160,"thus.  And they told him, that there was an Addanc in a cave, which slew","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2031",5160,"them once every day.  And thus they remained that night.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2032",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2033",5160,"And next morning the youths arose to sally forth, and Peredur besought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2034",5160,"them, for the sake of the ladies of their love, to permit him to go with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2035",5160,"them; but they refused him, saying, “If thou shouldst be slain there,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2036",5160,"thou hast none to bring thee back to life again.”  And they rode forward,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2037",5160,"and Peredur followed after them; and, after they had disappeared out of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2038",5160,"his sight, he came to a mound, whereon sat the fairest lady he had ever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2039",5160,"beheld.  “I know thy quest,” said she; “thou art going to encounter the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2040",5160,"Addanc, and he will slay thee, and that not by courage, but by craft.  He","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2041",5160,"has a cave, and at the entrance of the cave there is a stone pillar, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2042",5160,"he sees every one that enters, and none see him; and from behind the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2043",5160,"pillar he slays every one with a poisonous dart.  And if thou wouldst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2044",5160,"pledge me thy faith to love me above all women, I would give thee a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2045",5160,"stone, by which thou shouldst see him when thou goest in, and he should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2046",5160,"not see thee.”  “I will, by my troth,” said Peredur, “for when first I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2047",5160,"beheld thee I loved thee; and where shall I seek thee?”  “When thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2048",5160,"seekest me, seek towards India.”  And the maiden vanished, after placing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2049",5160,"the stone in Peredur’s hand.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2050",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2051",5160,"And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the borders","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2052",5160,"of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2053",5160,"meadows.  And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2054",5160,"on the other a flock of black sheep.  And whenever one of the white sheep","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2055",5160,"bleated, one of the black sheep would cross over and become white; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2056",5160,"when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep would cross","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2057",5160,"over and become black.  And he saw a tall tree by the side of the river,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2058",5160,"one half of which was in flames from the root to the top, and the other","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2059",5160,"half was green and in full leaf.  And nigh thereto he saw a youth sitting","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2060",5160,"upon a mound, and two greyhounds, white-breasted and spotted, in leashes,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2061",5160,"lying by his side.  And certain was he that he had never seen a youth of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2062",5160,"so royal a bearing as he.  And in the wood opposite he heard hounds","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2063",5160,"raising a herd of deer.  And Peredur saluted the youth, and the youth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2064",5160,"greeted him in return.  And there were three roads leading from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2065",5160,"mound; two of them were wide roads, and the third was more narrow.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2066",5160,"Peredur inquired where the three roads went.  “One of them goes to my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2067",5160,"palace,” said the youth; “and one of two things I counsel thee to do;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2068",5160,"either to proceed to my palace, which is before thee, and where thou wilt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2069",5160,"find my wife, or else to remain here to see the hounds chasing the roused","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2070",5160,"deer from the wood to the plain.  And thou shalt see the best greyhounds","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2071",5160,"thou didst ever behold, and the boldest in the chase, kill them by the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2072",5160,"water beside us; and when it is time to go to meat, my page will come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2073",5160,"with my horse to meet me, and thou shalt rest in my palace to-night.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2074",5160,"“Heaven reward thee; but I cannot tarry, for onward must I go.”  “The","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2075",5160,"other road leads to the town, which is near here, and wherein food and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2076",5160,"liquor may be bought; and the road which is narrower than the others goes","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2077",5160,"towards the cave of the Addanc.”  “With thy permission, young man, I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2078",5160,"go that way.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2079",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2080",5160,"And Peredur went towards the cave.  And he took the stone in his left","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2081",5160,"hand, and his lance in his right.  And as he went in he perceived the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2082",5160,"Addanc, and he pierced him through with his lance, and cut off his head.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2083",5160,"And as he came from the cave, behold the three companions were at the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2084",5160,"entrance; and they saluted Peredur, and told him that there was a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2085",5160,"prediction that he should slay that monster.  And Peredur gave the head","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2086",5160,"to the young men, and they offered him in marriage whichever of the three","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2087",5160,"sisters he might choose, and half their kingdom with her.  “I came not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2088",5160,"hither to woo,” said Peredur, “but if peradventure I took a wife, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2089",5160,"should prefer your sister to all others.”  And Peredur rode forward, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2090",5160,"he heard a noise behind him.  And he looked back, and saw a man upon a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2091",5160,"red horse, with red armour upon him; and the man rode up by his side, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2092",5160,"saluted him, and wished him the favour of Heaven and of man.  And Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2093",5160,"greeted the youth kindly.  “Lord, I come to make a request unto thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2094",5160,"“What wouldest thou?”  “That thou shouldest take me as thine attendant.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2095",5160,"“Whom then should I take as my attendant, if I did so?”  “I will not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2096",5160,"conceal from thee what kindred I am of.  Etlym Gleddyv Coch am I called,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2097",5160,"an Earl from the East Country.”  “I marvel that thou shouldest offer to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2098",5160,"become attendant to a man whose possessions are no greater than thine","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2099",5160,"own; for I have but an earldom like thyself.  But since thou desirest to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2100",5160,"be my attendant, I will take thee joyfully.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2101",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2102",5160,"And they went forward to the Court of the Countess, and all they of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2103",5160,"Court were glad at their coming; and they were told it was not through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2104",5160,"disrespect they were placed below the household, but that such was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2105",5160,"usage of the Court.  For, whoever should overthrow the three hundred men","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2106",5160,"of her household, would sit next the Countess, and she would love him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2107",5160,"above all men.  And Peredur having overthrown the three hundred men of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2108",5160,"her household, sat down beside her, and the Countess said, “I thank","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2109",5160,"Heaven that I have a youth so fair and so valiant as thou, since I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2110",5160,"not obtained the man whom best I love.”  “Who is he whom best thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2111",5160,"lovest?”  “By my faith, Etlym Gleddyv Coch is the man whom I love best,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2112",5160,"and I have never seen him.”  “Of a truth, Etlym is my companion; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2113",5160,"behold here he is, and for his sake did I come to joust with thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2114",5160,"household.  And he could have done so better than I, had it pleased him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2115",5160,"And I do give thee unto him.”  “Heaven reward thee, fair youth, and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2116",5160,"will take the man whom I love above all others.”  And the Countess became","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2117",5160,"Etlym’s bride from that moment.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2118",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2119",5160,"And the next day Peredur set forth towards the Mound of Mourning.  “By","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2120",5160,"thy hand, lord, but I will go with thee,” said Etlym.  Then they went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2121",5160,"forwards till they came in sight of the mound and the tents.  “Go unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2122",5160,"yonder men,” said Peredur to Etlym, “and desire them to come and do me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2123",5160,"homage.”  So Etlym went unto them, and said unto them thus,—“Come and do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2124",5160,"homage to my lord.”  “Who is thy lord?” said they.  “Peredur with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2125",5160,"long lance is my lord,” said Etlym.  “Were it permitted to slay a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2126",5160,"messenger, thou shouldest not go back to thy lord alive, for making unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2127",5160,"Kings, and Earls, and Barons so arrogant a demand as to go and do him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2128",5160,"homage.”  Peredur desired him to go back to them, and to give them their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2129",5160,"choice, either to do him homage, or to do battle with him.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2130",5160,"chose rather to do battle.  And that day Peredur overthrew the owners of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2131",5160,"a hundred tents; and the next day he overthrew the owners of a hundred","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2132",5160,"more; and the third day the remaining hundred took counsel to do homage","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2133",5160,"to Peredur.  And Peredur inquired of them, wherefore they were there.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2134",5160,"And they told him they were guarding the serpent until he should die.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2135",5160,"“For then should we fight for the stone among ourselves, and whoever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2136",5160,"should be conqueror among us would have the stone.”  “Await here,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2137",5160,"Peredur, “and I will go to encounter the serpent.”  “Not so, lord,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2138",5160,"they; “we will go altogether to encounter the serpent.”  “Verily,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2139",5160,"Peredur, “that will I not permit; for if the serpent be slain, I shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2140",5160,"derive no more fame therefrom than one of you.”  Then he went to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2141",5160,"place where the serpent was, and slew it, and came back to them, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2142",5160,"said, “Reckon up what you have spent since you have been here, and I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2143",5160,"repay you to the full.”  And he paid to each what he said was his claim.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2144",5160,"And he required of them only that they should acknowledge themselves his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2145",5160,"vassals.  And he said to Etlym, “Go back unto her whom thou lovest best,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2146",5160,"and I will go forwards, and I will reward thee for having been my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2147",5160,"attendant.”  And he gave Etlym the stone.  “Heaven repay thee and prosper","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2148",5160,"thee,” said Etlym.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2149",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2150",5160,"And Peredur rode thence, and he came to the fairest valley he had ever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2151",5160,"seen, through which ran a river; and there he beheld many tents of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2152",5160,"various colours.  And he marvelled still more at the number of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2153",5160,"water-mills and of wind-mills that he saw.  And there rode up with him a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2154",5160,"tall auburn-haired man, in workman’s garb, and Peredur inquired of him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2155",5160,"who he was.  “I am the chief miller,” said he, “of all the mills yonder.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2156",5160,"“Wilt thou give me lodging?” said Peredur.  “I will, gladly,” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2157",5160,"answered.  And Peredur came to the miller’s house, and the miller had a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2158",5160,"fair and pleasant dwelling.  And Peredur asked money as a loan from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2159",5160,"miller, that he might buy meat and liquor for himself and for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2160",5160,"household, and he promised that he would pay him again ere he went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2161",5160,"thence.  And he inquired of the miller, wherefore such a multitude was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2162",5160,"there assembled.  Said the miller to Peredur, “One thing is certain:","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2163",5160,"either thou art a man from afar, or thou art beside thyself.  The Empress","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2164",5160,"of Cristinobyl the Great is here; and she will have no one but the man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2165",5160,"who is most valiant; for riches does she not require.  And it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2166",5160,"impossible to bring food for so many thousands as are here, therefore","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2167",5160,"were all these mills constructed.”  And that night they took their rest.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2168",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2169",5160,"And the next day Peredur arose, and he equipped himself and his horse for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2170",5160,"the tournament.  And among the other tents he beheld one, which was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2171",5160,"fairest he had ever seen.  And he saw a beauteous maiden leaning her head","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2172",5160,"out of a window of the tent, and he had never seen a maiden more lovely","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2173",5160,"than she.  And upon her was a garment of satin.  And he gazed fixedly on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2174",5160,"the maiden, and began to love her greatly.  And he remained there, gazing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2175",5160,"upon the maiden from morning until mid-day, and from mid-day until","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2176",5160,"evening; and then the tournament was ended and he went to his lodging and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2177",5160,"drew off his armour.  Then he asked money of the miller as a loan, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2178",5160,"the miller’s wife was wroth with Peredur; nevertheless, the miller lent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2179",5160,"him the money.  And the next day he did in like manner as he had done the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2180",5160,"day before.  And at night he came to his lodging, and took money as a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2181",5160,"loan from the miller.  And the third day, as he was in the same place,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2182",5160,"gazing upon the maiden, he felt a hard blow between the neck and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2183",5160,"shoulder, from the edge of an axe.  And when he looked behind him, he saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2184",5160,"that it was the miller; and the miller said to him, “Do one of two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2185",5160,"things: either turn thy head from hence, or go to the tournament.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2186",5160,"Peredur smiled on the miller, and went to the tournament; and all that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2187",5160,"encountered him that day he overthrew.  And as many as he vanquished he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2188",5160,"sent as a gift to the Empress, and their horses and arms he sent as a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2189",5160,"gift to the wife of the miller, in payment of the borrowed money.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2190",5160,"Peredur attended the tournament until all were overthrown, and he sent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2191",5160,"all the men to the prison of the Empress, and the horses and arms to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2192",5160,"wife of the miller, in payment of the borrowed money.  And the Empress","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2193",5160,"sent to the Knight of the Mill, to ask him to come and visit her.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2194",5160,"Peredur went not for the first nor for the second message.  And the third","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2195",5160,"time she sent a hundred knights to bring him against his will, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2196",5160,"went to him and told him their mission from the Empress.  And Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2197",5160,"fought well with them, and caused them to be bound like stags, and thrown","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2198",5160,"into the mill-dyke.  And the Empress sought advice of a wise man who was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2199",5160,"in her counsel; and he said to her, “With thy permission, I will go to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2200",5160,"him myself.”  So he came to Peredur, and saluted him, and besought him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2201",5160,"for the sake of the lady of his love, to come and visit the Empress.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2202",5160,"they went, together with the miller.  And Peredur went and sat down in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2203",5160,"the outer chamber of the tent, and she came and placed herself by his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2204",5160,"side.  And there was but little discourse between them.  And Peredur took","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2205",5160,"his leave, and went to his lodging.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2206",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2207",5160,"And the next day he came to visit her, and when he came into the tent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2208",5160,"there was no one chamber less decorated than the others.  And they knew","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2209",5160,"not where he would sit.  And Peredur went and sat beside the Empress, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2210",5160,"discoursed with her courteously.  And while they were thus, they beheld a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2211",5160,"black man enter with a goblet full of wine in his hand.  And he dropped","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2212",5160,"upon his knee before the Empress, and besought her to give it to no one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2213",5160,"who would not fight with him for it.  And she looked upon Peredur.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2214",5160,"“Lady,” said he, “bestow on me the goblet.”  And Peredur drank the wine,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2215",5160,"and gave the goblet to the miller’s wife.  And while they were thus,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2216",5160,"behold there entered a black man of larger stature than the other, with a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2217",5160,"wild beast’s claw in his hand, wrought into the form of a goblet and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2218",5160,"filled with wine.  And he presented it to the Empress, and besought her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2219",5160,"to give it to no one but the man who would fight with him.  “Lady,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2220",5160,"Peredur, “bestow it on me.”  And she gave it to him.  And Peredur drank","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2221",5160,"the wine, and sent the goblet to the wife of the miller.  And while they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2222",5160,"were thus, behold a rough-looking, crisp-haired man, taller than either","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2223",5160,"of the others, came in with a bowl in his hand full of wine; and he bent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2224",5160,"upon his knee, and gave it into the hands of the Empress, and he besought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2225",5160,"her to give it to none but him who would fight with him for it; and she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2226",5160,"gave it to Peredur, and he sent it to the miller’s wife.  And that night","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2227",5160,"Peredur returned to his lodging; and the next day he accoutred himself","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2228",5160,"and his horse, and went to the meadow and slew the three men.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2229",5160,"Peredur proceeded to the tent, and the Empress said to him, “Goodly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2230",5160,"Peredur, remember the faith thou didst pledge me when I gave thee the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2231",5160,"stone, and thou didst kill the Addanc.”  “Lady,” answered he, “thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2232",5160,"sayest truth, I do remember it.”  And Peredur was entertained by the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2233",5160,"Empress fourteen years, as the story relates.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2234",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2236",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2237",5160,"Arthur was at Caerlleon upon Usk, his principal palace; and in the centre","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2238",5160,"of the floor of the hall were four men sitting on a carpet of velvet,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2239",5160,"Owain the son of Urien, and Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, and Howel the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2240",5160,"of Emyr Llydaw, and Peredur of the long lance.  And thereupon they saw a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2241",5160,"black curly-headed maiden enter, riding upon a yellow mule, with jagged","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2242",5160,"thongs in her hand to urge it on; and having a rough and hideous aspect.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2243",5160,"Blacker were her face and her two hands than the blackest iron covered","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2244",5160,"with pitch; and her hue was not more frightful than her form.  High","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2245",5160,"cheeks had she, and a face lengthened downwards, and a short nose with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2246",5160,"distended nostrils.  And one eye was of a piercing mottled grey, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2247",5160,"other was as black as jet, deep-sunk in her head.  And her teeth were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2248",5160,"long and yellow, more yellow were they than the flower of the broom.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2249",5160,"her stomach rose from the breast-bone, higher than her chin.  And her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2250",5160,"back was in the shape of a crook, and her legs were large and bony.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2251",5160,"her figure was very thin and spare, except her feet and her legs, which","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2252",5160,"were of huge size.  And she greeted Arthur and all his household except","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2253",5160,"Peredur.  And to Peredur she spoke harsh and angry words.  “Peredur, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2254",5160,"greet thee not, seeing that thou dost not merit it.  Blind was fate in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2255",5160,"giving thee fame and favour.  When thou wast in the Court of the Lame","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2256",5160,"King, and didst see there the youth bearing the streaming spear, from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2257",5160,"points of which were drops of blood flowing in streams, even to the hand","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2258",5160,"of the youth, and many other wonders likewise, thou didst not inquire","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2259",5160,"their meaning nor their cause.  Hadst thou done so, the King would have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2260",5160,"been restored to health, and his dominions to peace.  Whereas from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2261",5160,"henceforth, he will have to endure battles and conflicts, and his knights","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2262",5160,"will perish, and wives will be widowed, and maidens will be left","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2263",5160,"portionless, and all this is because of thee.”  Then said she unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2264",5160,"Arthur, “May it please thee, lord, my dwelling is far hence, in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2265",5160,"stately castle of which thou hast heard, and therein are five hundred and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2266",5160,"sixty-six knights of the order of Chivalry, and the lady whom best he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2267",5160,"loves with each; and whoever would acquire fame in arms, and encounters,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2268",5160,"and conflicts, he will gain it there, if he deserve it.  And whoso would","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2269",5160,"reach the summit of fame and of honour, I know where he may find it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2270",5160,"There is a castle on a lofty mountain, and there is a maiden therein, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2271",5160,"she is detained a prisoner there, and whoever shall set her free will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2272",5160,"attain the summit of the fame of the world.”  And thereupon she rode","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2273",5160,"away.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2274",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2275",5160,"Said Gwalchmai, “By my faith, I will not rest tranquilly until I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2276",5160,"proved if I can release the maiden.”  And many of Arthur’s household","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2277",5160,"joined themselves with him.  Then, likewise, said Peredur, “By my faith,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2278",5160,"I will not rest tranquilly until I know the story and the meaning of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2279",5160,"lance whereof the black maiden spoke.”  And while they were equipping","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2280",5160,"themselves, behold a knight came to the gate.  And he had the size and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2281",5160,"the strength of a warrior, and was equipped with arms and habiliments.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2282",5160,"And he went forward, and saluted Arthur and all his household, except","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2283",5160,"Gwalchmai.  And the knight had upon his shoulder a shield, ingrained with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2284",5160,"gold, with a fesse of azure blue upon it, and his whole armour was of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2285",5160,"same hue.  And he said to Gwalchmai, “Thou didst slay my lord by thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2286",5160,"treachery and deceit, and that will I prove upon thee.”  Then Gwalchmai","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2287",5160,"rose up.  “Behold,” said he, “here is my gage against thee, to maintain,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2288",5160,"either in this place or wherever else thou wilt, that I am not a traitor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2289",5160,"or deceiver.”  “Before the King whom I obey, will I that my encounter","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2290",5160,"with thee take place,” said the knight.  “Willingly,” said Gwalchmai; “go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2291",5160,"forward, and I will follow thee.”  So the knight went forth, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2292",5160,"Gwalchmai accoutred himself, and there was offered unto him abundance of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2293",5160,"armour, but he would take none but his own.  And when Gwalchmai and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2294",5160,"Peredur were equipped, they set forth to follow him, by reason of their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2295",5160,"fellowship and of the great friendship that was between them.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2296",5160,"did not go after him in company together, but each went his own way.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2297",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2298",5160,"At the dawn of day Gwalchmai came to a valley, and in the valley he saw a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2299",5160,"fortress, and within the fortress a vast palace and lofty towers around","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2300",5160,"it.  And he beheld a knight coming out to hunt from the other side,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2301",5160,"mounted on a spirited black snorting palfrey, that advanced at a prancing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2302",5160,"pace, proudly stepping, and nimbly bounding, and sure of foot; and this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2303",5160,"was the man to whom the palace belonged.  And Gwalchmai saluted him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2304",5160,"“Heaven prosper thee, chieftain,” said he, “and whence comest thou?”  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2305",5160,"come,” answered Gwalchmai, “from the Court of Arthur.”  “And art thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2306",5160,"Arthur’s vassal?”  “Yes, by my faith,” said Gwalchmai.  “I will give thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2307",5160,"good counsel,” said the knight.  “I see that thou art tired and weary; go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2308",5160,"unto my palace, if it may please thee, and tarry there to-night.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2309",5160,"“Willingly, lord,” said he, “and Heaven reward thee.”  “Take this ring as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2310",5160,"a token to the porter, and go forward to yonder tower, and therein thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2311",5160,"wilt find my sister.”  And Gwalchmai went to the gate, and showed the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2312",5160,"ring, and proceeded to the tower.  And on entering he beheld a large","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2313",5160,"blazing fire, burning without smoke and with a bright and lofty flame,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2314",5160,"and a beauteous and stately maiden was sitting on a chair by the fire.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2315",5160,"And the maiden was glad at his coming, and welcomed him, and advanced to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2316",5160,"meet him.  And he went and sat beside the maiden, and they took their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2317",5160,"repast.  And when their repast was over, they discoursed pleasantly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2318",5160,"together.  And while they were thus, behold there entered a venerable","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2319",5160,"hoary-headed man.  “Ah! base girl,” said he, “if thou didst think it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2320",5160,"right for thee to entertain and to sit by yonder man, thou wouldest not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2321",5160,"do so.”  And he withdrew his head, and went forth.  “Ah! chieftain,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2322",5160,"the maiden, “if thou wilt do as I counsel thee, thou wilt shut the door,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2323",5160,"lest the man should have a plot against thee.”  Upon that Gwalchmai","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2324",5160,"arose, and when he came near unto the door, the man, with sixty others,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2325",5160,"fully armed, were ascending the tower.  And Gwalchmai defended the door","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2326",5160,"with a chessboard, that none might enter until the man should return from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2327",5160,"the chase.  And thereupon, behold the Earl arrived.  “What is all this?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2328",5160,"asked he.  “It is a sad thing,” said the hoary-headed man; “the young","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2329",5160,"girl yonder has been sitting and eating with him who slew your father.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2330",5160,"He is Gwalchmai, the son of Gwyar.”  “Hold thy peace, then,” said the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2331",5160,"Earl, “I will go in.”  And the Earl was joyful concerning Gwalchmai.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2332",5160,"“Ha! chieftain,” said he, “it was wrong of thee to come to my court, when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2333",5160,"thou knewest that thou didst slay my father; and though we cannot avenge","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2334",5160,"him, Heaven will avenge him upon thee.”  “My soul,” said Gwalchmai, “thus","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2335",5160,"it is: I came not here either to acknowledge or to deny having slain thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2336",5160,"father; but I am on a message from Arthur, and therefore do I crave the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2337",5160,"space of a year until I shall return from my embassy, and then, upon my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2338",5160,"faith, I will come back unto this palace, and do one of two things,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2339",5160,"either acknowledge it, or deny it.”  And the time was granted him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2340",5160,"willingly; and he remained there that night.  And the next morning he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2341",5160,"rode forth.  And the story relates nothing further of Gwalchmai","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2342",5160,"respecting this adventure.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2343",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2344",5160,"And Peredur rode forward.  And he wandered over the whole island, seeking","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2345",5160,"tidings of the black maiden, and he could meet with none.  And he came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2346",5160,"an unknown land, in the centre of a valley, watered by a river.  And as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2347",5160,"he traversed the valley he beheld a horseman coming towards him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2348",5160,"wearing the garments of a priest; and he besought his blessing.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2349",5160,"“Wretched man,” said he, “thou meritest no blessing, and thou wouldest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2350",5160,"not be profited by one, seeing that thou art clad in armour on such a day","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2351",5160,"as this.”  “And what day is to-day?” said Peredur.  “To-day is Good","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2352",5160,"Friday,” he answered.  “Chide me not that I knew not this, seeing that it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2353",5160,"is a year to-day since I journeyed forth from my country.”  Then he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2354",5160,"dismounted, and led his horse in his hand.  And he had not proceeded far","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2355",5160,"along the high road before he came to a cross road, and the cross road","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2356",5160,"traversed a wood.  And on the other side of the wood he saw an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2357",5160,"unfortified castle, which appeared to be inhabited.  And at the gate of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2358",5160,"the castle there met him the priest whom he had seen before, and he asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2359",5160,"his blessing.  “The blessing of Heaven be unto thee,” said he, “it is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2360",5160,"more fitting to travel in thy present guise than as thou wast erewhile;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2361",5160,"and this night thou shalt tarry with me.”  So he remained there that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2362",5160,"night.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2363",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2364",5160,"And the next day Peredur sought to go forth.  “To-day may no one journey.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2365",5160,"Thou shalt remain with me to-day and to-morrow, and the day following,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2366",5160,"and I will direct thee as best I may to the place which thou art","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2367",5160,"seeking.”  And the fourth day Peredur sought to go forth, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2368",5160,"entreated the priest to tell him how he should find the Castle of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2369",5160,"Wonders.  “What I know thereof I will tell thee,” he replied.  “Go over","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2370",5160,"yonder mountain, and on the other side of the mountain thou wilt come to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2371",5160,"a river, and in the valley wherein the river runs is a King’s palace,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2372",5160,"wherein the King sojourned during Easter.  And if thou mayest have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2373",5160,"tidings anywhere of the Castle of Wonders, thou wilt have them there.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2374",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2375",5160,"Then Peredur rode forward.  And he came to the valley in which was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2376",5160,"river, and there met him a number of men going to hunt, and in the midst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2377",5160,"of them was a man of exalted rank, and Peredur saluted him.  “Choose,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2378",5160,"chieftain,” said the man, “whether thou wilt go with me to the chase, or","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2379",5160,"wilt proceed to my palace, and I will dispatch one of my household to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2380",5160,"commend thee to my daughter, who is there, and who will entertain thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2381",5160,"with food and liquor until I return from hunting; and whatever may be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2382",5160,"thine errand, such as I can obtain for thee thou shalt gladly have.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2383",5160,"the King sent a little yellow page with him as an attendant; and when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2384",5160,"they came to the palace the lady had arisen, and was about to wash before","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2385",5160,"meat.  Peredur went forward, and she saluted him joyfully, and placed him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2386",5160,"by her side.  And they took their repast.  And whatsoever Peredur said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2387",5160,"unto her, she laughed loudly, so that all in the palace could hear.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2388",5160,"spoke the yellow page to the lady.  “By my faith,” said he, “this youth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2389",5160,"is already thy husband; or if he be not, thy mind and thy thoughts are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2390",5160,"set upon him.”  And the little yellow page went unto the King, and told","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2391",5160,"him that it seemed to him that the youth whom he had met with was his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2392",5160,"daughter’s husband, or if he were not so already that he would shortly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2393",5160,"become so unless he were cautious.  “What is thy counsel in this matter,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2394",5160,"youth?” said the King.  “My counsel is,” he replied, “that thou set","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2395",5160,"strong men upon him, to seize him, until thou hast ascertained the truth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2396",5160,"respecting this.”  So he set strong men upon Peredur, who seized him and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2397",5160,"cast him into prison.  And the maiden went before her father, and asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2398",5160,"him wherefore he had caused the youth from Arthur’s Court to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2399",5160,"imprisoned.  “In truth,” he answered, “he shall not be free to-night, nor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2400",5160,"to-morrow, nor the day following, and he shall not come from where he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2401",5160,"is.”  She replied not to what the King had said, but she went to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2402",5160,"youth.  “Is it unpleasant to thee to be here?” said she.  “I should not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2403",5160,"care if I were not,” he replied.  “Thy couch and thy treatment shall be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2404",5160,"in no wise inferior to that of the King himself, and thou shalt have the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2405",5160,"best entertainment that the palace affords.  And if it were more pleasing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2406",5160,"to thee that my couch should be here, that I might discourse with thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2407",5160,"it should be so, cheerfully.”  “This can I not refuse,” said Peredur.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2408",5160,"And he remained in prison that night.  And the maiden provided all that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2409",5160,"she had promised him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2410",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2411",5160,"And the next day Peredur heard a tumult in the town.  “Tell me, fair","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2412",5160,"maiden, what is that tumult?” said Peredur.  “All the King’s hosts and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2413",5160,"his forces have come to the town to-day.”  “And what seek they here?” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2414",5160,"inquired.  “There is an Earl near this place who possesses two Earldoms,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2415",5160,"and is as powerful as a King; and an engagement will take place between","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2416",5160,"them to-day.”  “I beseech thee,” said Peredur, “to cause a horse and arms","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2417",5160,"to be brought, that I may view the encounter, and I promise to come back","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2418",5160,"to my prison again.”  “Gladly,” said she, “will I provide thee with horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2419",5160,"and arms.”  So she gave him a horse and arms, and a bright scarlet robe","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2420",5160,"of honour over his armour, and a yellow shield upon his shoulder.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2421",5160,"went to the combat; and as many of the Earl’s men as encountered him that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2422",5160,"day he overthrew; and he returned to his prison.  And the maiden asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2423",5160,"tidings of Peredur, and he answered her not a word.  And she went and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2424",5160,"asked tidings of her father, and inquired who had acquitted himself best","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2425",5160,"of the household.  And he said that he knew not, but that it was a man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2426",5160,"with a scarlet robe of honour over his armour, and a yellow shield upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2427",5160,"his shoulder.  Then she smiled, and returned to where Peredur was, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2428",5160,"did him great honour that night.  And for three days did Peredur slay the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2429",5160,"Earl’s men; and before any one could know who he was, he returned to his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2430",5160,"prison.  And the fourth day Peredur slew the Earl himself.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2431",5160,"maiden went unto her father, and inquired of him the news.  “I have good","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2432",5160,"news for thee,” said the King; “the Earl is slain, and I am the owner of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2433",5160,"his two Earldoms.”  “Knowest thou, lord, who slew him?”  “I do not know,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2434",5160,"said the King.  “It was the knight with the scarlet robe of honour and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2435",5160,"the yellow shield.”  “Lord,” said she, “I know who that is.”  “By","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2436",5160,"Heaven!” he exclaimed, “who is he?”  “Lord,” she replied, “he is the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2437",5160,"knight whom thou hast imprisoned.”  Then he went unto Peredur, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2438",5160,"saluted him, and told him that he would reward the service he had done","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2439",5160,"him, in any way he might desire.  And when they went to meat, Peredur was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2440",5160,"placed beside the King, and the maiden on the other side of Peredur.  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2441",5160,"will give thee,” said the King, “my daughter in marriage, and half my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2442",5160,"kingdom with her, and the two Earldoms as a gift.”  “Heaven reward thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2443",5160,"lord,” said Peredur, “but I came not here to woo.”  “What seekest thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2444",5160,"then, chieftain?”  “I am seeking tidings of the Castle of Wonders.”  “Thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2445",5160,"enterprise is greater, chieftain, than thou wilt wish to pursue,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2446",5160,"the maiden, “nevertheless, tidings shalt thou have of the Castle, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2447",5160,"thou shalt have a guide through my father’s dominions, and a sufficiency","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2448",5160,"of provisions for thy journey, for thou art, O chieftain, the man whom","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2449",5160,"best I love.”  Then she said to him, “Go over yonder mountain, and thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2450",5160,"wilt find a lake, and in the middle of the lake there is a Castle, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2451",5160,"that is the Castle that is called the Castle of Wonders; and we know not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2452",5160,"what wonders are therein, but thus is it called.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2453",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2454",5160,"And Peredur proceeded towards the Castle, and the gate of the Castle was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2455",5160,"open.  And when he came to the hall, the door was open, and he entered.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2456",5160,"And he beheld a chessboard in the hall, and the chessmen were playing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2457",5160,"against each other, by themselves.  And the side that he favoured lost","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2458",5160,"the game, and thereupon the others set up a shout, as though they had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2459",5160,"been living men.  And Peredur was wroth, and took the chessmen in his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2460",5160,"lap, and cast the chessboard into the lake.  And when he had done thus,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2461",5160,"behold the black maiden came in, and she said to him, “The welcome of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2462",5160,"Heaven be not unto thee.  Thou hadst rather do evil than good.”  “What","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2463",5160,"complaint hast thou against me, maiden?” said Peredur.  “That thou hast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2464",5160,"occasioned unto the Empress the loss of her chessboard, which she would","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2465",5160,"not have lost for all her empire.  And the way in which thou mayest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2466",5160,"recover the chessboard is, to repair to the Castle of Ysbidinongyl, where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2467",5160,"is a black man, who lays waste the dominions of the Empress; and if thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2468",5160,"canst slay him, thou wilt recover the chessboard.  But if thou goest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2469",5160,"there, thou wilt not return alive.”  “Wilt thou direct me thither?” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2470",5160,"Peredur.  “I will show thee the way,” she replied.  So he went to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2471",5160,"Castle of Ysbidinongyl, and he fought with the black man.  And the black","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2472",5160,"man besought mercy of Peredur.  “Mercy will I grant thee,” said he, “on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2473",5160,"condition that thou cause the chessboard to be restored to the place","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2474",5160,"where it was when I entered the hall.”  Then the maiden came to him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2475",5160,"said, “The malediction of Heaven attend thee for thy work, since thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2476",5160,"hast left that monster alive, who lays waste all the possessions of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2477",5160,"Empress.”  “I granted him his life,” said Peredur, “that he might cause","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2478",5160,"the chessboard to be restored.”  “The chessboard is not in the place","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2479",5160,"where thou didst find it; go back, therefore, and slay him,” answered","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2480",5160,"she.  So Peredur went back, and slew the black man.  And when he returned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2481",5160,"to the palace, he found the black maiden there.  “Ah! maiden,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2482",5160,"Peredur, “where is the Empress?”  “I declare to Heaven that thou wilt not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2483",5160,"see her now, unless thou dost slay the monster that is in yonder forest.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2484",5160,"“What monster is there?”  “It is a stag that is as swift as the swiftest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2485",5160,"bird; and he has one horn in his forehead, as long as the shaft of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2486",5160,"spear, and as sharp as whatever is sharpest.  And he destroys the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2487",5160,"branches of the best trees in the forest, and he kills every animal that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2488",5160,"he meets with therein; and those that he doth not slay perish of hunger.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2489",5160,"And what is worse than that, he comes every night, and drinks up the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2490",5160,"fish-pond, and leaves the fishes exposed, so that for the most part they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2491",5160,"die before the water returns again.”  “Maiden,” said Peredur, “wilt thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2492",5160,"come and show me this animal?”  “Not so,” said the maiden, “for he has","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2493",5160,"not permitted any mortal to enter the forest for above a twelvemonth.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2494",5160,"Behold, here is a little dog belonging to the Empress, which will rouse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2495",5160,"the stag, and will chase him towards thee, and the stag will attack","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2496",5160,"thee.”  Then the little dog went as a guide to Peredur, and roused the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2497",5160,"stag, and brought him towards the place where Peredur was.  And the stag","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2498",5160,"attacked Peredur, and he let him pass by him, and as he did so, he smote","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2499",5160,"off his head with his sword.  And while he was looking at the head of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2500",5160,"stag, he saw a lady on horseback coming towards him.  And she took the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2501",5160,"little dog in the lappet of her cap, and the head and the body of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2502",5160,"stag lay before her.  And around the stag’s neck was a golden collar.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2503",5160,"“Ha! chieftain,” said she, “uncourteously hast thou acted in slaying the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2504",5160,"fairest jewel that was in my dominions.”  “I was entreated so to do; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2505",5160,"is there any way by which I can obtain thy friendship?”  “There is,” she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2506",5160,"replied.  “Go thou forward unto yonder mountain, and there thou wilt find","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2507",5160,"a grove; and in the grove there is a cromlech; do thou there challenge a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2508",5160,"man three times to fight, and thou shalt have my friendship.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2509",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2510",5160,"So Peredur proceeded onward, and came to the side of the grove, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2511",5160,"challenged any man to fight.  And a black man arose from beneath the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2512",5160,"cromlech, mounted upon a bony horse, and both he and his horse were clad","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2513",5160,"in huge rusty armour.  And they fought.  And as often as Peredur cast the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2514",5160,"black man to the earth, he would jump again into his saddle.  And Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2515",5160,"dismounted, and drew his sword; and thereupon the black man disappeared","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2516",5160,"with Peredur’s horse and his own, so that he could not gain sight of him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2517",5160,"a second time.  And Peredur went along the mountain, and on the other","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2518",5160,"side of the mountain he beheld a castle in the valley, wherein was a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2519",5160,"river.  And he went to the castle; and as he entered it, he saw a hall,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2520",5160,"and the door of the hall was open, and he went in.  And there he saw a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2521",5160,"lame grey-headed man sitting on one side of the hall, with Gwalchmai","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2522",5160,"beside him.  And Peredur beheld his horse, which the black man had taken,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2523",5160,"in the same stall with that of Gwalchmai.  And they were glad concerning","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2524",5160,"Peredur.  And he went and seated himself on the other side of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2525",5160,"hoary-headed man.  Then, behold a yellow-haired youth came, and bent upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2526",5160,"the knee before Peredur, and besought his friendship.  “Lord,” said the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2527",5160,"youth, “it was I that came in the form of the black maiden to Arthur’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2528",5160,"Court, and when thou didst throw down the chessboard, and when thou didst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2529",5160,"slay the black man of Ysbidinongyl, and when thou didst slay the stag,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2530",5160,"and when thou didst go to fight the black man of the cromlech.  And I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2531",5160,"came with the bloody head in the salver, and with the lance that streamed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2532",5160,"with blood from the point to the hand, all along the shaft; and the head","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2533",5160,"was thy cousin’s, and he was killed by the sorceresses of Gloucester, who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2534",5160,"also lamed thine uncle; and I am thy cousin.  And there is a prediction","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2535",5160,"that thou art to avenge these things.”  Then Peredur and Gwalchmai took","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2536",5160,"counsel, and sent to Arthur and his household, to beseech them to come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2537",5160,"against the sorceresses.  And they began to fight with them; and one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2538",5160,"the sorceresses slew one of Arthur’s men before Peredur’s face, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2539",5160,"Peredur bade her forbear.  And the sorceress slew a man before Peredur’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2540",5160,"face a second time, and a second time he forbad her.  And the third time","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2541",5160,"the sorceress slew a man before the face of Peredur; and then Peredur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2542",5160,"drew his sword, and smote the sorceress on the helmet; and all her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2543",5160,"head-armour was split in two parts.  And she set up a cry, and desired","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2544",5160,"the other sorceresses to flee, and told them that this was Peredur, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2545",5160,"man who had learnt Chivalry with them, and by whom they were destined to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2546",5160,"be slain.  Then Arthur and his household fell upon the sorceresses, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2547",5160,"slew the sorceresses of Gloucester every one.  And thus is it related","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2548",5160,"concerning the Castle of Wonders.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2549",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2556",5160,"ARTHUR was accustomed to hold his Court at Caerlleon upon Usk.  And there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2557",5160,"he held it seven Easters and five Christmases.  And once upon a time he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2558",5160,"held his Court there at Whitsuntide.  For Caerlleon was the place most","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2559",5160,"easy of access in his dominions, both by sea and by land.  And there were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2560",5160,"assembled nine crowned kings, who were his tributaries, and likewise","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2561",5160,"earls and barons.  For they were his invited guests at all the high","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2562",5160,"festivals, unless they were prevented by any great hindrance.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2563",5160,"he was at Caerlleon, holding his Court, thirteen churches were set apart","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2564",5160,"for mass.  And thus were they appointed: one church for Arthur, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2565",5160,"kings, and his guests; and the second for Gwenhwyvar and her ladies; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2566",5160,"the third for the Steward of the Household and the suitors; and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2567",5160,"fourth for the Franks and the other officers; and the other nine churches","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2568",5160,"were for the nine Masters of the Household and chiefly for Cwalchmai; for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2569",5160,"he, from the eminence of his warlike fame, and from the nobleness of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2570",5160,"birth, was the most exalted of the nine.  And there was no other","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2571",5160,"arrangement respecting the churches than that which we have mentioned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2572",5160,"above.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2573",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2574",5160,"Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr was the chief porter; but he did not himself perform","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2575",5160,"the office, except at one of the three high festivals, for he had seven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2576",5160,"men to serve him, and they divided the year amongst them.  They were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2577",5160,"Grynn, and Pen Pighon, and Llaes Cymyn, and Gogyfwlch, and Gwrdnei with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2578",5160,"cat’s eyes, who could see as well by night as by day, and Drem the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2579",5160,"Dremhitid, and Clust the son of Clustveinyd; and these were Arthur’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2580",5160,"guards.  And on Whit-Tuesday, as the King sat at the banquet, lo! there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2581",5160,"entered a tall, fair-headed youth, clad in a coat and a surcoat of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2582",5160,"diapered satin, and a golden-hilted sword about his neck, and low shoes","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2583",5160,"of leather upon his feet.  And he came, and stood before Arthur.  “Hail","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2584",5160,"to thee, Lord!” said he.  “Heaven prosper thee,” he answered, “and be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2585",5160,"thou welcome.  Dost thou bring any new tidings?”  “I do, Lord,” he said.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2586",5160,"“I know thee not,” said Arthur.  “It is a marvel to me that thou dost not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2587",5160,"know me.  I am one of thy foresters, Lord, in the Forest of Dean, and my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2588",5160,"name is Madawc, the son of Twrgadarn.”  “Tell me thine errand,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2589",5160,"Arthur.  “I will do so, Lord,” said he.  “In the Forest I saw a stag, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2590",5160,"like of which beheld I never yet.”  “What is there about him,” asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2591",5160,"Arthur, “that thou never yet didst see his like?”  “He is of pure white,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2592",5160,"Lord, and he does not herd with any other animal through stateliness and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2593",5160,"pride, so royal is his bearing.  And I come to seek thy counsel, Lord,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2594",5160,"and to know thy will concerning him.”  “It seems best to me,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2595",5160,"Arthur, “to go and hunt him to-morrow at break of day; and to cause","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2596",5160,"general notice thereof to be given to-night in all quarters of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2597",5160,"Court.”  And Arryfuerys was Arthur’s chief huntsman, and Arelivri was his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2598",5160,"chief page.  And all received notice; and thus it was arranged.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2599",5160,"sent the youth before them.  Then Gwenhwyvar said to Arthur, “Wilt thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2600",5160,"permit me, Lord,” said she, “to go to-morrow to see and hear the hunt of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2601",5160,"the stag of which the young man spoke?”  “I will gladly,” said Arthur.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2602",5160,"“Then will I go,” said she.  And Gwalchmai said to Arthur, “Lord, if it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2603",5160,"seem well to thee, permit that into whose hunt soever the stag shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2604",5160,"come, that one, be he a knight, or one on foot, may cut off his head, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2605",5160,"give it to whom he pleases, whether to his own lady-love, or to the lady","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2606",5160,"of his friend.”  “I grant it gladly,” said Arthur, “and let the Steward","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2607",5160,"of the Household be chastised, if all are not ready to-morrow for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2608",5160,"chase.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2609",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2610",5160,"And they passed the night with songs, and diversions, and discourse, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2611",5160,"ample entertainment.  And when it was time for them all to go to sleep,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2612",5160,"they went.  And when the next day came, they arose; and Arthur called the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2613",5160,"attendants, who guarded his couch.  And these were four pages, whose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2614",5160,"names were Cadyrnerth the son of Porthawr Gandwy, and Ambreu the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2615",5160,"Bedwor, and Amhar the son of Arthur, and Goreu the son of Custennin.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2616",5160,"these men came to Arthur and saluted him, and arrayed him in his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2617",5160,"garments.  And Arthur wondered that Gwenhwyvar did not awake, and did not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2618",5160,"move in her bed; and the attendants wished to awaken her.  “Disturb her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2619",5160,"not,” said Arthur, “for she had rather sleep than go to see the hunting.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2620",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2621",5160,"Then Arthur went forth, and he heard two horns sounding, one from near","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2622",5160,"the lodging of the chief huntsman, and the other from near that of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2623",5160,"chief page.  And the whole assembly of the multitudes came to Arthur, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2624",5160,"they took the road to the Forest.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2625",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2626",5160,"And after Arthur had gone forth from the palace, Gwenhwyvar awoke, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2627",5160,"called to her maidens, and apparelled herself.  “Maidens,” said she, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2628",5160,"had leave last night to go and see the hunt.  Go one of you to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2629",5160,"stable, and order hither a horse such as a woman may ride.”  And one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2630",5160,"them went, and she found but two horses in the stable, and Gwenhwyvar and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2631",5160,"one of her maidens mounted them, and went through the Usk, and followed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2632",5160,"the track of the men and the horses.  And as they rode thus, they heard a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2633",5160,"loud and rushing sound; and they looked behind them, and beheld a knight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2634",5160,"upon a hunter foal of mighty size; and the rider was a fair-haired youth,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2635",5160,"bare-legged, and of princely mien, and a golden-hilted sword was at his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2636",5160,"side, and a robe and a surcoat of satin were upon him, and two low shoes","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2637",5160,"of leather upon his feet; and around him was a scarf of blue purple, at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2638",5160,"each corner of which was a golden apple.  And his horse stepped stately,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2639",5160,"and swift, and proud; and he overtook Gwenhwyvar, and saluted her.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2640",5160,"“Heaven prosper thee, Geraint,” said she, “I knew thee when first I saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2641",5160,"thee just now.  And the welcome of Heaven be unto thee.  And why didst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2642",5160,"thou not go with thy lord to hunt?”  “Because I knew not when he went,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2643",5160,"said he.  “I marvel, too,” said she, “how he could go unknown to me.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2644",5160,"“Indeed, lady,” said he.  “I was asleep, and knew not when he went; but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2645",5160,"thou, O young man, art the most agreeable companion I could have in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2646",5160,"whole kingdom; and it may be, that I shall be more amused with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2647",5160,"hunting than they; for we shall hear the horns when they sound, and we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2648",5160,"shall hear the dogs when they are let loose, and begin to cry.”  So they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2649",5160,"went to the edge of the Forest, and there they stood.  “From this place,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2650",5160,"said she, “we shall hear when the dogs are let loose.”  And thereupon,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2651",5160,"they heard a loud noise, and they looked towards the spot whence it came,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2652",5160,"and they beheld a dwarf riding upon a horse, stately, and foaming, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2653",5160,"prancing, and strong, and spirited.  And in the hand of the dwarf was a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2654",5160,"whip.  And near the dwarf they saw a lady upon a beautiful white horse,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2655",5160,"of steady and stately pace; and she was clothed in a garment of gold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2656",5160,"brocade.  And near her was a knight upon a warhorse of large size, with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2657",5160,"heavy and bright armour both upon himself and upon his horse.  And truly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2658",5160,"they never before saw a knight, or a horse, or armour, of such remarkable","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2659",5160,"size.  And they were all near to each other.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2660",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2661",5160,"“Geraint,” said Gwenhwyvar, “knowest thou the name of that tall knight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2662",5160,"yonder?”  “I know him not,” said he, “and the strange armour that he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2663",5160,"wears prevents my either seeing his face or his features.”  “Go, maiden,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2664",5160,"said Gwenhwyvar, “and ask the dwarf who that knight is.”  Then the maiden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2665",5160,"went up to the dwarf; and the dwarf waited for the maiden, when he saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2666",5160,"her coming towards him.  And the maiden inquired of the dwarf who the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2667",5160,"knight was.  “I will not tell thee,” he answered.  “Since thou art so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2668",5160,"churlish as not to tell me,” said she, “I will ask him himself.”  “Thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2669",5160,"shalt not ask him, by my faith,” said he.  “Wherefore?” said she.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2670",5160,"“Because thou art not of honour sufficient to befit thee to speak to my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2671",5160,"Lord.”  Then the maiden turned her horse’s head towards the knight, upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2672",5160,"which the dwarf struck her with the whip that was in his hand across the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2673",5160,"face and the eyes, until the blood flowed forth.  And the maiden, through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2674",5160,"the hurt she received from the blow, returned to Gwenhwyvar, complaining","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2675",5160,"of the pain.  “Very rudely has the dwarf treated thee,” said Geraint.  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2676",5160,"will go myself to know who the knight is.”  “Go,” said Gwenhwyvar.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2677",5160,"Geraint went up to the dwarf.  “Who is yonder knight?” said Geraint.  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2678",5160,"will not tell thee,” said the dwarf.  “Then will I ask him himself,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2679",5160,"he.  “That wilt thou not, by my faith,” said the dwarf, “thou art not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2680",5160,"honourable enough to speak with my Lord.”  Said Geraint, “I have spoken","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2681",5160,"with men of equal rank with him.”  And he turned his horse’s head towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2682",5160,"the knight; but the dwarf overtook him, and struck him as he had done the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2683",5160,"maiden, so that the blood coloured the scarf that Geraint wore.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2684",5160,"Geraint put his hand upon the hilt of his sword, but he took counsel with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2685",5160,"himself, and considered that it would be no vengeance for him to slay the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2686",5160,"dwarf, and to be attacked unarmed by the armed knight, so he returned to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2687",5160,"where Gwenhwyvar was.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2688",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2689",5160,"“Thou hast acted wisely and discreetly,” said she.  “Lady,” said he, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2690",5160,"will follow him yet, with thy permission; and at last he will come to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2691",5160,"some inhabited place, where I may have arms either as a loan or for a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2692",5160,"pledge, so that I may encounter the knight.”  “Go,” said she, “and do not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2693",5160,"attack him until thou hast good arms, and I shall be very anxious","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2694",5160,"concerning thee, until I hear tidings of thee.”  “If I am alive,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2695",5160,"he, “thou shalt hear tidings of me by to-morrow afternoon;” and with that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2696",5160,"he departed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2697",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2698",5160,"And the road they took was below the palace of Caerlleon, and across the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2699",5160,"ford of the Usk; and they went along a fair, and even, and lofty ridge of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2700",5160,"ground, until they came to a town, and at the extremity of the town they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2701",5160,"saw a Fortress and a Castle.  And they came to the extremity of the town.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2702",5160,"And as the knight passed through it, all the people arose, and saluted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2703",5160,"him, and bade him welcome.  And when Geraint came into the town, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2704",5160,"looked at every house, to see if he knew any of those whom he saw.  But","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2705",5160,"he knew none, and none knew him to do him the kindness to let him have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2706",5160,"arms either as a loan or for a pledge.  And every house he saw was full","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2707",5160,"of men, and arms, and horses.  And they were polishing shields, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2708",5160,"burnishing swords, and washing armour, and shoeing horses.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2709",5160,"knight, and the lady, and the dwarf rode up to the Castle that was in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2710",5160,"town, and every one was glad in the Castle.  And from the battlements and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2711",5160,"the gates they risked their necks, through their eagerness to greet them,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2712",5160,"and to show their joy.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2713",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2714",5160,"Geraint stood there to see whether the knight would remain in the Castle;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2715",5160,"and when he was certain that he would do so, he looked around him; and at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2716",5160,"a little distance from the town he saw an old palace in ruins, wherein","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2717",5160,"was a hall that was falling to decay.  And as he knew not any one in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2718",5160,"town, he went towards the old palace; and when he came near to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2719",5160,"palace, he saw but one chamber, and a bridge of marble-stone leading to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2720",5160,"it.  And upon the bridge he saw sitting a hoary-headed man, upon whom","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2721",5160,"were tattered garments.  And Geraint gazed steadfastly upon him for a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2722",5160,"long time.  Then the hoary-headed man spoke to him.  “Young man,” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2723",5160,"said, “wherefore art thou thoughtful?”  “I am thoughtful,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2724",5160,"“because I know not where to go to-night.”  “Wilt thou come forward this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2725",5160,"way, chieftain?” said he, “and thou shalt have of the best that can be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2726",5160,"procured for thee.”  So Geraint went forward.  And the hoary-headed man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2727",5160,"preceded him into the hall.  And in the hall he dismounted, and he left","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2728",5160,"there his horse.  Then he went on to the upper chamber with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2729",5160,"hoary-headed man.  And in the chamber he beheld an old decrepit woman,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2730",5160,"sitting on a cushion, with old, tattered garments of satin upon her; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2731",5160,"it seemed to him that he had never seen a woman fairer than she must have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2732",5160,"been, when in the fulness of youth.  And beside her was a maiden, upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2733",5160,"whom were a vest and a veil, that were old, and beginning to be worn out.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2734",5160,"And truly, he never saw a maiden more full of comeliness, and grace, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2735",5160,"beauty than she.  And the hoary-headed man said to the maiden, “There is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2736",5160,"no attendant for the horse of this youth but thyself.”  “I will render","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2737",5160,"the best service I am able,” said she, “both to him and to his horse.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2738",5160,"And the maiden disarrayed the youth, and then she furnished his horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2739",5160,"with straw and with corn.  And she went to the hall as before, and then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2740",5160,"she returned to the chamber.  And the hoary-headed man said to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2741",5160,"maiden, “Go to the town,” said he, “and bring hither the best that thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2742",5160,"canst find both of food and of liquor.”  “I will, gladly, Lord,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2743",5160,"she.  And to the town went the maiden.  And they conversed together while","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2744",5160,"the maiden was at the town.  And, behold! the maiden came back, and a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2745",5160,"youth with her, bearing on his back a costrel full of good purchased","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2746",5160,"mead, and a quarter of a young bullock.  And in the hands of the maiden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2747",5160,"was a quantity of white bread, and she had some manchet bread in her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2748",5160,"veil, and she came into the chamber.  “I could not obtain better than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2749",5160,"this,” said she, “nor with better should I have been trusted.”  “It is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2750",5160,"good enough,” said Geraint.  And they caused the meat to be boiled; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2751",5160,"when their food was ready, they sat down.  And it was on this wise;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2752",5160,"Geraint sat between the hoary-headed man and his wife, and the maiden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2753",5160,"served them.  And they ate and drank.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2754",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2755",5160,"And when they had finished eating, Geraint talked with the hoary-headed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2756",5160,"man, and he asked him in the first place, to whom belonged the palace","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2757",5160,"that he was in.  “Truly,” said he, “it was I that built it, and to me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2758",5160,"also belonged the city and the castle which thou sawest.”  “Alas!” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2759",5160,"Geraint, “how is it that thou hast lost them now?”  “I lost a great","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2760",5160,"Earldom as well as these,” said he; “and this is how I lost them.  I had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2761",5160,"a nephew, the son of my brother, and I took his possessions to myself;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2762",5160,"and when he came to his strength, he demanded of me his property, but I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2763",5160,"withheld it from him.  So he made war upon me, and wrested from me all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2764",5160,"that I possessed.”  “Good Sir,” said Geraint, “wilt thou tell me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2765",5160,"wherefore came the knight, and the lady, and the dwarf, just now into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2766",5160,"town, and what is the preparation which I saw, and the putting of arms in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2767",5160,"order?”  “I will do so,” said he.  “The preparations are for the game","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2768",5160,"that is to be held to-morrow by the young Earl, which will be on this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2769",5160,"wise.  In the midst of a meadow which is here, two forks will be set up,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2770",5160,"and upon the two forks a silver rod, and upon the silver rod a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2771",5160,"Sparrow-Hawk, and for the Sparrow-Hawk there will be a tournament.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2772",5160,"to the tournament will go all the array thou didst see in the city, of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2773",5160,"men, and of horses, and of arms.  And with each man will go the lady he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2774",5160,"loves best; and no man can joust for the Sparrow-Hawk, except the lady he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2775",5160,"loves best be with him.  And the knight that thou sawest has gained the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2776",5160,"Sparrow-Hawk these two years; and if he gains it the third year, they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2777",5160,"will, from that time, send it every year to him, and he himself will come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2778",5160,"here no more.  And he will be called the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2779",5160,"that time forth.”  “Sir,” said Geraint, “what is thy counsel to me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2780",5160,"concerning this knight, on account of the insult which I received from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2781",5160,"the dwarf, and that which was received by the maiden of Gwenhwyvar, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2782",5160,"wife of Arthur?”  And Geraint told the hoary-headed man what the insult","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2783",5160,"was that he had received.  “It is not easy to counsel thee, inasmuch as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2784",5160,"thou hast neither dame nor maiden belonging to thee, for whom thou canst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2785",5160,"joust.  Yet, I have arms here, which thou couldest have; and there is my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2786",5160,"horse also, if he seem to thee better than thine own.”  “Ah!  Sir,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2787",5160,"he, “Heaven reward thee.  But my own horse, to which I am accustomed,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2788",5160,"together with thy arms, will suffice me.  And if, when the appointed time","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2789",5160,"shall come to-morrow, thou wilt permit me, Sir, to challenge for yonder","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2790",5160,"maiden that is thy daughter, I will engage, if I escape from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2791",5160,"tournament, to love the maiden as long as I live; and if I do not escape,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2792",5160,"she will remain unsullied as before.”  “Gladly will I permit thee,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2793",5160,"the hoary-headed man, “and since thou dost thus resolve, it is necessary","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2794",5160,"that thy horse and arms should be ready to-morrow at break of day.  For","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2795",5160,"then the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk will make proclamation, and ask the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2796",5160,"lady he loves best to take the Sparrow-Hawk.  ‘For,’ will he say to her,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2797",5160,"‘thou art the fairest of women, and thou didst possess it last year, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2798",5160,"the year previous; and if any deny it thee to-day, by force will I defend","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2799",5160,"it for thee.’  And therefore,” said the hoary-headed man, “it is needful","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2800",5160,"for thee to be there at daybreak; and we three will be with thee.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2801",5160,"thus was it settled.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2802",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2803",5160,"And at night, lo! they went to sleep; and before the dawn they arose, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2804",5160,"arrayed themselves; and by the time that it was day, they were all four","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2805",5160,"in the meadow.  And there was the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk making the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2806",5160,"proclamation, and asking his lady-love to fetch the Sparrow-Hawk.  “Fetch","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2807",5160,"it not,” said Geraint, “for there is here a maiden, who is fairer, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2808",5160,"more noble, and more comely, and who has a better claim to it than thou.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2809",5160,"“If thou maintainest the Sparrow-Hawk to be due to her, come forward, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2810",5160,"do battle with me.”  And Geraint went forward to the top of the meadow,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2811",5160,"having upon himself and upon his horse armour which was heavy, and rusty,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2812",5160,"and worthless, and of uncouth shape.  Then they encountered each other,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2813",5160,"and they broke a set of lances, and they broke a second set, and a third.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2814",5160,"And thus they did at every onset, and they broke as many lances as were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2815",5160,"brought to them.  And when the Earl and his company saw the Knight of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2816",5160,"Sparrow-Hawk gaining the mastery, there was shouting, and joy, and mirth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2817",5160,"amongst them.  And the hoary-headed man, and his wife, and his daughter","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2818",5160,"were sorrowful.  And the hoary-headed man served Geraint lances as often","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2819",5160,"as he broke them, and the dwarf served the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2820",5160,"Then the hoary-headed man came to Geraint.  “Oh! chieftain,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2821",5160,"“since no other will hold with thee, behold, here is the lance which was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2822",5160,"in my hand on the day when I received the honour of knighthood; and from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2823",5160,"that time to this I never broke it.  And it has an excellent point.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2824",5160,"Then Geraint took the lance, thanking the hoary-headed man.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2825",5160,"thereupon the dwarf also brought a lance to his lord.  “Behold, here is a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2826",5160,"lance for thee, not less good than his,” said the dwarf.  “And bethink","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2827",5160,"thee, that no knight ever withstood thee before so long as this one has","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2828",5160,"done.”  “I declare to Heaven,” said Geraint, “that unless death takes me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2829",5160,"quickly hence, he shall fare never the better for thy service.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2830",5160,"Geraint pricked his horse towards him from afar, and warning him, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2831",5160,"rushed upon him, and gave him a blow so severe, and furious, and fierce,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2832",5160,"upon the face of his shield, that he cleft it in two, and broke his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2833",5160,"armour, and burst his girths, so that both he and his saddle were borne","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2834",5160,"to the ground over the horse’s crupper.  And Geraint dismounted quickly.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2835",5160,"And he was wroth, and he drew his sword, and rushed fiercely upon him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2836",5160,"Then the knight also arose, and drew his sword against Geraint.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2837",5160,"fought on foot with their swords until their arms struck sparks of fire","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2838",5160,"like stars from one another; and thus they continued fighting until the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2839",5160,"blood and sweat obscured the light from their eyes.  And when Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2840",5160,"prevailed, the hoary-headed man, and his wife, and his daughter were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2841",5160,"glad; and when the knight prevailed, it rejoiced the Earl and his party.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2842",5160,"Then the hoary-headed man saw Geraint receive a severe stroke, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2843",5160,"went up to him quickly, and said to him, “Oh, chieftain, remember the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2844",5160,"treatment which thou hadst from the dwarf; and wilt thou not seek","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2845",5160,"vengeance for the insult to thyself, and for the insult to Gwenhwyvar the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2846",5160,"wife of Arthur!”  And Geraint was roused by what he said to him, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2847",5160,"called to him all his strength, and lifted up his sword, and struck the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2848",5160,"knight upon the crown of his head, so that he broke all his head-armour,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2849",5160,"and cut through all the flesh and the skin, even to the skull, until he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2850",5160,"wounded the bone.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2851",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2852",5160,"Then the knight fell upon his knees, and cast his sword from his hand,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2853",5160,"and besought mercy of Geraint.  “Of a truth,” said he, “I relinquish my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2854",5160,"overdaring and my pride in craving thy mercy; and unless I have time to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2855",5160,"commit myself to Heaven for my sins, and to talk with a priest, thy mercy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2856",5160,"will avail me little.”  “I will grant thee grace upon this condition,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2857",5160,"said Geraint, “that thou wilt go to Gwenhwyvar the wife of Arthur, to do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2858",5160,"her satisfaction for the insult which her maiden received from thy dwarf.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2859",5160,"As to myself, for the insult which I received from thee and thy dwarf, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2860",5160,"am content with that which I have done unto thee.  Dismount not from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2861",5160,"time thou goest hence until thou comest into the presence of Gwenhwyvar,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2862",5160,"to make her what atonement shall be adjudged at the Court of Arthur.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2863",5160,"“This will I do gladly.  And who art thou?” said he.  “I am Geraint the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2864",5160,"son of Erbin.  And declare thou also who thou art.”  “I am Edeyrn the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2865",5160,"of Nudd.”  Then he threw himself upon his horse, and went forward to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2866",5160,"Arthur’s Court, and the lady he loved best went before him and the dwarf,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2867",5160,"with much lamentation.  And thus far this story up to that time.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2868",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2870",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2871",5160,"Then came the little Earl and his hosts to Geraint, and saluted him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2872",5160,"bade him to his castle.  “I may not go,” said Geraint, “but where I was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2873",5160,"last night, there will I be to-night also.”  “Since thou wilt none of my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2874",5160,"inviting, thou shalt have abundance of all that I can command for thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2875",5160,"in the place thou wast last night.  And I will order ointment for thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2876",5160,"to recover thee from thy fatigues, and from the weariness that is upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2877",5160,"thee.”  “Heaven reward thee,” said Geraint, “and I will go to my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2878",5160,"lodging.”  And thus went Geraint, and Earl Ynywl, and his wife, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2879",5160,"daughter.  And when they reached the chamber, the household servants and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2880",5160,"attendants of the young Earl had arrived at the Court, and they arranged","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2881",5160,"all the houses, dressing them with straw and with fire; and in a short","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2882",5160,"time the ointment was ready, and Geraint came there, and they washed his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2883",5160,"head.  Then came the young Earl, with forty honourable knights from among","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2884",5160,"his attendants, and those who were bidden to the tournament.  And Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2885",5160,"came from the anointing.  And the Earl asked him to go to the hall to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2886",5160,"eat.  “Where is the Earl Ynywl,” said Geraint, “and his wife, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2887",5160,"daughter?”  “They are in the chamber yonder,” said the Earl’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2888",5160,"chamberlain, “arraying themselves in garments which the Earl has caused","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2889",5160,"to be brought for them.”  “Let not the damsel array herself,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2890",5160,"“except in her vest and her veil, until she come to the Court of Arthur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2891",5160,"to be clad by Gwenhwyvar in such garments as she may choose.”  So the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2892",5160,"maiden did not array herself.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2893",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2894",5160,"Then they all entered the hall, and they washed, and went, and sat down","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2895",5160,"to meat.  And thus were they seated.  On one side of Geraint sat the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2896",5160,"young Earl, and Earl Ynywl beyond him; and on the other side of Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2897",5160,"were the maiden and her mother.  And after these all sat according to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2898",5160,"their precedence in honour.  And they ate.  And they were served","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2899",5160,"abundantly, and they received a profusion of divers kind of gifts.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2900",5160,"they conversed together.  And the young Earl invited Geraint to visit him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2901",5160,"next day.  “I will not, by Heaven,” said Geraint.  “To the Court of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2902",5160,"Arthur will I go with this maiden to-morrow.  And it is enough for me, as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2903",5160,"long as Earl Ynywl is in poverty and trouble; and I go chiefly to seek to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2904",5160,"add to his maintenance.”  “Ah, chieftain,” said the young Earl, “it is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2905",5160,"not by my fault that Earl Ynywl is without his possessions.”  “By my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2906",5160,"faith,” said Geraint, “he shall not remain without them, unless death","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2907",5160,"quickly takes me hence.”  “Oh, chieftain,” said he, “with regard to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2908",5160,"disagreement between me and Ynywl, I will gladly abide by thy counsel,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2909",5160,"and agree to what thou mayest judge right between us.”  “I but ask thee,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2910",5160,"said Geraint, “to restore to him what is his, and what he should have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2911",5160,"received from the time he lost his possessions, even until this day.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2912",5160,"“That I will do gladly, for thee,” answered he.  “Then,” said Geraint,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2913",5160,"“whosoever is here who owes homage to Ynywl, let him come forward, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2914",5160,"perform it on the spot.”  And all the men did so.  And by that treaty","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2915",5160,"they abided.  And his castle, and his town, and all his possessions were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2916",5160,"restored to Ynywl.  And he received back all that he had lost, even to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2917",5160,"the smallest jewel.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2918",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2919",5160,"Then spoke Earl Ynywl to Geraint.  “Chieftain,” said he, “behold the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2920",5160,"maiden for whom thou didst challenge at the tournament, I bestow her upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2921",5160,"thee.”  “She shall go with me,” said Geraint, “to the Court of Arthur;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2922",5160,"and Arthur and Gwenhwyvar they shall dispose of her as they will.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2923",5160,"the next day they proceeded to Arthur’s Court.  So far concerning","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2924",5160,"Geraint.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"2928",5160,"Now, this is how Arthur hunted the stag.  The men and the dogs were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2929",5160,"divided into hunting parties, and the dogs were let loose upon the stag.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2930",5160,"And the last dog that was let loose was the favourite dog of Arthur.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2931",5160,"Cavall was his name.  And he left all the other dogs behind him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2932",5160,"turned the stag.  And at the second turn, the stag came towards the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2933",5160,"hunting party of Arthur.  And Arthur set upon him.  And before he could","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2934",5160,"be slain by any other, Arthur cut off his head.  Then they sounded the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2935",5160,"death horn for slaying, and they all gathered round.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2936",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2937",5160,"Then came Kadyrieith to Arthur, and spoke to him.  “Lord,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2938",5160,"“behold, yonder is Gwenhwyvar, and none with her save only one maiden.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2939",5160,"“Command Gildas the son of Caw, and all the scholars of the Court,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2940",5160,"Arthur, “to attend Gwenhwyvar to the palace.”  And they did so.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2941",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2942",5160,"Then they all set forth, holding converse together concerning the head of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2943",5160,"the stag, to whom it should be given.  One wished that it should be given","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2944",5160,"to the lady best beloved by him, and another to the lady whom he loved","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2945",5160,"best.  And all they of the household, and the knights, disputed sharply","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2946",5160,"concerning the head.  And with that they came to the palace.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2947",5160,"Arthur and Gwenhwyvar heard them disputing about the head of the stag,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2948",5160,"Gwenhwyvar said to Arthur, “My lord, this is my counsel concerning the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2949",5160,"stag’s head; let it not be given away until Geraint the son of Erbin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2950",5160,"shall return from the errand he is upon.”  And Gwenhwyvar told Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2951",5160,"what that errand was.  “Right gladly shall it be so,” said Arthur.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2952",5160,"thus it was settled.  And the next day Gwenhwyvar caused a watch to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2953",5160,"set upon the ramparts for Geraint’s coming.  And after mid-day they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2954",5160,"beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse, and after him, as they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2955",5160,"supposed, a dame or a damsel, also on horseback, and after her a knight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2956",5160,"of large stature, bowed down, and hanging his head low and sorrowfully,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2957",5160,"and clad in broken and worthless armour.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2958",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2959",5160,"And before they came near to the gate, one of the watch went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2960",5160,"Gwenhwyvar, and told her what kind of people they saw, and what aspect","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2961",5160,"they bore.  “I know not who they are,” said he.  “But I know,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2962",5160,"Gwenhwyvar; “this is the knight whom Geraint pursued, and methinks that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2963",5160,"he comes not here by his own free will.  But Geraint has overtaken him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2964",5160,"and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost.”  And thereupon,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2965",5160,"behold a porter came to the spot where Gwenhwyvar was.  “Lady,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2966",5160,"“at the gate there is a knight, and I saw never a man of so pitiful an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2967",5160,"aspect to look upon as he.  Miserable and broken is the armour that he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2968",5160,"wears, and the hue of blood is more conspicuous upon it than its own","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2969",5160,"colour.”  “Knowest thou his name?” said she.  “I do,” said he; “he tells","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2970",5160,"me that he is Edeyrn the son of Nudd.”  Then she replied, “I know him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2971",5160,"not.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2972",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2973",5160,"So Gwenhwyvar went to the gate to meet him, and he entered.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2974",5160,"Gwenhwyvar was sorry when she saw the condition he was in, even though he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2975",5160,"was accompanied by the churlish dwarf.  Then Edeyrn saluted Gwenhwyvar.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2976",5160,"“Heaven protect thee,” said she.  “Lady,” said he, “Geraint the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2977",5160,"Erbin, thy best and most valiant servant, greets thee.”  “Did he meet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2978",5160,"thee?” she asked.  “Yes,” said he, “and it was not to my advantage; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2979",5160,"that was not his fault, but mine, Lady.  And Geraint greets thee well;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2980",5160,"and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2981",5160,"for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf.  He forgives the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2982",5160,"insult to himself, in consideration of his having put me in peril of my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2983",5160,"life.  And he imposed on me a condition, manly, and honourable, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2984",5160,"warrior-like, which was to do thee justice, Lady.”  “Now, where did he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2985",5160,"overtake thee?”  “At the place where we were jousting, and contending for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2986",5160,"the Sparrow-Hawk, in the town which is now called Cardiff.  And there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2987",5160,"were none with him save three persons, of a mean and tattered condition.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2988",5160,"And these were an aged, hoary-headed man, and a woman advanced in years,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2989",5160,"and a fair young maiden, clad in worn-out garments.  And it was for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2990",5160,"avouchment of the love of that maiden that Geraint jousted for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2991",5160,"Sparrow-Hawk at the tournament, for he said that that maiden was better","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2992",5160,"entitled to the Sparrow-Hawk than this maiden who was with me.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2993",5160,"thereupon we encountered each other, and he left me, Lady, as thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2994",5160,"seest.”  “Sir,” said she, “when thinkest thou that Geraint will be here?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2995",5160,"“To-morrow, Lady, I think he will be here with the maiden.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2996",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2997",5160,"Then Arthur came to him, and he saluted Arthur; and Arthur gazed a long","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2998",5160,"time upon him, and was amazed to see him thus.  And thinking that he knew","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"2999",5160,"him, he inquired of him, “Art thou Edeyrn the son of Nudd?”  “I am,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3000",5160,"Lord,” said he, “and I have met with much trouble, and received wounds","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3001",5160,"unsupportable.”  Then he told Arthur all his adventure.  “Well,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3002",5160,"Arthur, “from what I hear, it behoves Gwenhwyvar to be merciful towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3003",5160,"thee.”  “The mercy which thou desirest, Lord,” said she, “will I grant to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3004",5160,"him, since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3005",5160,"me as to thyself.”  “Thus will it be best to do,” said Arthur; “let this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3006",5160,"man have medical care until it be known whether he may live.  And if he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3007",5160,"live, he shall do such satisfaction as shall be judged best by the men of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3008",5160,"the Court; and take thou sureties to that effect.  And if he die, too","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3009",5160,"much will be the death of such a youth as Edeyrn for an insult to a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3010",5160,"maiden.”  “This pleases me,” said Gwenhwyvar.  And Arthur became surety","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3011",5160,"for Edeyrn, and Caradawc the son of Llyr, Gwallawg the son of Llenawg,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3012",5160,"and Owain the son of Nudd, and Gwalchmai, and many others with them.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3013",5160,"Arthur caused Morgan Tud to be called to him.  He was the chief","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3014",5160,"physician.  “Take with thee Edeyrn the son of Nudd, and cause a chamber","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3015",5160,"to be prepared for him, and let him have the aid of medicine as thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3016",5160,"wouldst do unto myself, if I were wounded, and let none into his chamber","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3017",5160,"to molest him, but thyself and thy disciples, to administer to him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3018",5160,"remedies.”  “I will do so gladly, Lord,” said Morgan Tud.  Then said the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3019",5160,"steward of the household, “Whither is it right, Lord, to order the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3020",5160,"maiden?”  “To Gwenhwyvar and her handmaidens,” said he.  And the steward","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3021",5160,"of the household so ordered her.  Thus far concerning them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3022",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3023",5160,"                                * * * * *","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3024",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3025",5160,"The next day came Geraint towards the Court; and there was a watch set on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3026",5160,"the ramparts by Gwenhwyvar, lest he should arrive unawares.  And one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3027",5160,"the watch came to the place where Gwenhwyvar was.  “Lady,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3028",5160,"“methinks that I see Geraint, and the maiden with him.  He is on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3029",5160,"horseback, but he has his walking gear upon him, and the maiden appears","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3030",5160,"to be in white, seeming to be clad in a garment of linen.”  “Assemble all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3031",5160,"the women,” said Gwenhwyvar, “and come to meet Geraint, to welcome him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3032",5160,"and wish him joy.”  And Gwenhwyvar went to meet Geraint and the maiden.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3033",5160,"And when Geraint came to the place where Gwenhwyvar was, he saluted her.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3034",5160,"“Heaven prosper thee,” said she, “and welcome to thee.  And thy career","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3035",5160,"has been successful, and fortunate, and resistless, and glorious.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3036",5160,"Heaven reward thee, that thou hast so proudly caused me to have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3037",5160,"retribution.”  “Lady,” said he, “I earnestly desired to obtain thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3038",5160,"satisfaction according to thy will; and, behold, here is the maiden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3039",5160,"through whom thou hadst thy revenge.”  “Verily,” said Gwenhwyvar, “the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3040",5160,"welcome of Heaven be unto her; and it is fitting that we should receive","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3041",5160,"her joyfully.”  Then they went in, and dismounted.  And Geraint came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3042",5160,"where Arthur was, and saluted him.  “Heaven protect thee,” said Arthur,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3043",5160,"“and the welcome of Heaven be unto thee.  And since Edeyrn the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3044",5160,"Nudd has received his overthrow and wounds from thy hands, thou hast had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3045",5160,"a prosperous career.”  “Not upon me be the blame,” said Geraint, “it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3046",5160,"through the arrogance of Edeyrn the son of Nudd himself that we were not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3047",5160,"friends.  I would not quit him until I knew who he was, and until the one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3048",5160,"had vanquished the other.”  “Now,” said Arthur, “where is the maiden for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3049",5160,"whom I heard thou didst give challenge?”  “She is gone with Gwenhwyvar to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3050",5160,"her chamber.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3051",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3052",5160,"Then went Arthur to see the maiden.  And Arthur, and all his companions,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3053",5160,"and his whole Court, were glad concerning the maiden.  And certain were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3054",5160,"they all, that had her array been suitable to her beauty, they had never","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3055",5160,"seen a maid fairer than she.  And Arthur gave away the maiden to Geraint.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3056",5160,"And the usual bond made between two persons was made between Geraint and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3057",5160,"the maiden, and the choicest of all Gwenhwyvar’s apparel was given to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3058",5160,"maiden; and thus arrayed, she appeared comely and graceful to all who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3059",5160,"beheld her.  And that day and that night were spent in abundance of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3060",5160,"minstrelsy, and ample gifts of liquor, and a multitude of games.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3061",5160,"when it was time for them to go to sleep, they went.  And in the chamber","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3062",5160,"where the couch of Arthur and Gwenhwyvar was, the couch of Geraint and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3063",5160,"Enid was prepared.  And from that time she became his bride.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3064",5160,"next day Arthur satisfied all the claimants upon Geraint with bountiful","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3065",5160,"gifts.  And the maiden took up her abode in the palace; and she had many","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3066",5160,"companions, both men and women, and there was no maiden more esteemed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3067",5160,"than she in the Island of Britain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3068",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3069",5160,"Then spake Gwenhwyvar.  “Rightly did I judge,” said she, “concerning the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3070",5160,"head of the stag, that it should not be given to any until Geraint’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3071",5160,"return; and, behold, here is a fit occasion for bestowing it.  Let it be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3072",5160,"given to Enid the daughter of Ynywl, the most illustrious maiden.  And I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3073",5160,"do not believe that any will begrudge it her, for between her and every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3074",5160,"one here there exists nothing but love and friendship.”  Much applauded","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3075",5160,"was this by them all, and by Arthur also.  And the head of the stag was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3076",5160,"given to Enid.  And thereupon her fame increased, and her friends","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3077",5160,"thenceforward became more in number than before.  And Geraint from that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3078",5160,"time forth loved the stag, and the tournament, and hard encounters; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3079",5160,"he came victorious from them all.  And a year, and a second, and a third,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3080",5160,"he proceeded thus, until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3081",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3083",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3084",5160,"And once upon a time Arthur was holding his Court at Caerlleon upon Usk,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3085",5160,"at Whitsuntide.  And, behold, there came to him ambassadors, wise and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3086",5160,"prudent, full of knowledge, and eloquent of speech, and they saluted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3087",5160,"Arthur.  “Heaven prosper you,” said Arthur, “and the welcome of Heaven be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3088",5160,"unto you.  And whence do you come?”  “We come, Lord,” said they, “from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3089",5160,"Cornwall; and we are ambassadors from Erbin the son of Custennin, thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3090",5160,"uncle, and our mission is unto thee.  And he greets thee well, as an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3091",5160,"uncle should greet his nephew, and as a vassal should greet his lord.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3092",5160,"And he represents unto thee that he waxes heavy and feeble, and is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3093",5160,"advancing in years.  And the neighbouring chiefs, knowing this, grow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3094",5160,"insolent towards him, and covet his land and possessions.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3095",5160,"earnestly beseeches thee, Lord, to permit Geraint his son to return to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3096",5160,"him, to protect his possessions, and to become acquainted with his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3097",5160,"boundaries.  And unto him he represents that it were better for him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3098",5160,"spend the flower of his youth and the prime of his age in preserving his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3099",5160,"own boundaries, than in tournaments, which are productive of no profit,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3100",5160,"although he obtains glory in them.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3101",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3102",5160,"“Well,” said Arthur, “go, and divest yourselves of your accoutrements,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3103",5160,"and take food, and refresh yourselves after your fatigues; and before you","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3104",5160,"go forth hence you shall have an answer.”  And they went to eat.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3105",5160,"Arthur considered that it would go hard with him to let Geraint depart","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3106",5160,"from him and from his Court; neither did he think it fair that his cousin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3107",5160,"should be restrained from going to protect his dominions and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3108",5160,"boundaries, seeing that his father was unable to do so.  No less was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3109",5160,"grief and regret of Gwenhwyvar, and all her women, and all her damsels,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3110",5160,"through fear that the maiden would leave them.  And that day and that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3111",5160,"night were spent in abundance of feasting.  And Arthur showed Geraint the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3112",5160,"cause of the mission, and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3113",5160,"Cornwall.  “Truly,” said Geraint, “be it to my advantage or disadvantage,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3114",5160,"Lord, I will do according to thy will concerning this embassy.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3115",5160,"“Behold,” said Arthur, “though it grieves me to part with thee, it is my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3116",5160,"counsel that thou go to dwell in thine own dominions, and to defend thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3117",5160,"boundaries, and to take with thee to accompany thee as many as thou wilt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3118",5160,"of those thou lovest best among my faithful ones, and among thy friends,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3119",5160,"and among thy companions in arms.”  “Heaven reward thee; and this will I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3120",5160,"do,” said Geraint.  “What discourse,” said Gwenhwyvar, “do I hear between","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3121",5160,"you?  Is it of those who are to conduct Geraint to his country?”  “It","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3122",5160,"is,” said Arthur.  “Then it is needful for me to consider,” said she,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3123",5160,"“concerning companions and a provision for the lady that is with me?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3124",5160,"“Thou wilt do well,” said Arthur.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3125",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3126",5160,"And that night they went to sleep.  And the next day the ambassadors were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3127",5160,"permitted to depart, and they were told that Geraint should follow them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3128",5160,"And on the third day Geraint set forth, and many went with him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3129",5160,"Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, and Riogonedd the son of the king of Ireland,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3130",5160,"and Ondyaw the son of the duke of Burgundy, Gwilim the son of the ruler","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3131",5160,"of the Franks, Howel the son of Emyr of Brittany, Elivry, and Nawkyrd,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3132",5160,"Gwynn the son of Tringad, Goreu the son of Custennin, Gweir Gwrhyd Vawr,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3133",5160,"Garannaw the son of Golithmer, Peredur the son of Evrawc, Gwynnllogell,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3134",5160,"Gwyr a judge in the Court of Arthur, Dyvyr the son of Alun of Dyved,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3135",5160,"Gwrei Gwalstawd Ieithoedd, Bedwyr the son of Bedrawd, Hadwry the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3136",5160,"Gwryon, Kai the son of Kynyr, Odyar the Frank, the Steward of Arthur’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3137",5160,"Court, and Edeyrn the son of Nudd.  Said Geraint, “I think that I shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3138",5160,"have enough of knighthood with me.”  “Yes,” said Arthur, “but it will not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3139",5160,"be fitting for thee to take Edeyrn with thee, although he is well, until","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3140",5160,"peace shall be made between him and Gwenhwyvar.”  “Gwenhwyvar can permit","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3141",5160,"him to go with me, if he give sureties.”  “If she please, she can let him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3142",5160,"go without sureties, for enough of pain and affliction has he suffered","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3143",5160,"for the insult which the maiden received from the dwarf.”  “Truly,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3144",5160,"Gwenhwyvar, “since it seems well to thee and to Geraint, I will do this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3145",5160,"gladly, Lord.”  Then she permitted Edeyrn freely to depart.  And many","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3146",5160,"there were who accompanied Geraint, and they set forth; and never was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3147",5160,"there seen a fairer host journeying towards the Severn.  And on the other","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3148",5160,"side of the Severn were the nobles of Erbin the son of Custennin, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3149",5160,"foster-father at their head, to welcome Geraint with gladness; and many","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3150",5160,"of the women of the Court, with his mother, came to receive Enid the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3151",5160,"daughter of Ynywl, his wife.  And there was great rejoicing and gladness","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3152",5160,"throughout the whole Court, and throughout all the country, concerning","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3153",5160,"Geraint, because of the greatness of their love towards him, and of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3154",5160,"greatness of the fame which he had gained since he went from amongst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3155",5160,"them, and because he was come to take possession of his dominions and to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3156",5160,"preserve his boundaries.  And they came to the Court.  And in the Court","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3157",5160,"they had ample entertainment, and a multitude of gifts and abundance of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3158",5160,"liquor, and a sufficiency of service, and a variety of minstrelsy and of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3159",5160,"games.  And to do honour to Geraint, all the chief men of the country","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3160",5160,"were invited that night to visit him.  And they passed that day and that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3161",5160,"night in the utmost enjoyment.  And at dawn next day Erbin arose, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3162",5160,"summoned to him Geraint, and the noble persons who had borne him company.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3163",5160,"And he said to Geraint, “I am a feeble and aged man, and whilst I was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3164",5160,"able to maintain the dominion for thee and for myself, I did so.  But","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3165",5160,"thou art young, and in the flower of thy vigour and of thy youth;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3166",5160,"henceforth do thou preserve thy possessions.”  “Truly,” said Geraint,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3167",5160,"“with my consent thou shalt not give the power over thy dominions at this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3168",5160,"time into my hands, and thou shalt not take me from Arthur’s Court.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3169",5160,"“Into thy hands will I give them,” said Erbin, “and this day also shalt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3170",5160,"thou receive the homage of thy subjects.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3171",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3172",5160,"Then said Gwalchmai, “It were better for thee to satisfy those who have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3173",5160,"boons to ask, to-day, and to-morrow thou canst receive the homage of thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3174",5160,"dominions.”  So all that had boons to ask were summoned into one place.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3175",5160,"And Kadyrieith came to them, to know what were their requests.  And every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3176",5160,"one asked that which he desired.  And the followers of Arthur began to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3177",5160,"make gifts, and immediately the men of Cornwall came, and gave also.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3178",5160,"they were not long in giving, so eager was every one to bestow gifts.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3179",5160,"And of those who came to ask gifts, none departed unsatisfied.  And that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3180",5160,"day and that night were spent in the utmost enjoyment.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3181",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3182",5160,"And the next day, at dawn, Erbin desired Geraint to send messengers to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3183",5160,"the men, to ask them whether it was displeasing to them that he should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3184",5160,"come to receive their homage, and whether they had anything to object to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3185",5160,"him.  Then Geraint sent ambassadors to the men of Cornwall, to ask them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3186",5160,"this.  And they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honour","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3187",5160,"to them for Geraint to come and receive their homage.  So he received the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3188",5160,"homage of such as were there.  And they remained with him till the third","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3189",5160,"night.  And the day after the followers of Arthur intended to go away.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3190",5160,"“It is too soon for you to go away yet,” said he, “stay with me until I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3191",5160,"have finished receiving the homage of my chief men, who have agreed to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3192",5160,"come to me.”  And they remained with him until he had done so.  Then they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3193",5160,"set forth towards the Court of Arthur; and Geraint went to bear them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3194",5160,"company, and Enid also, as far as Diganhwy: there they parted.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3195",5160,"Ondyaw the son of the duke of Burgundy said to Geraint, “Go first of all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3196",5160,"and visit the uppermost parts of thy dominions, and see well to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3197",5160,"boundaries of thy territories; and if thou hast any trouble respecting","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3198",5160,"them, send unto thy companions.”  “Heaven reward thee,” said Geraint,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3199",5160,"“and this will I do.”  And Geraint journeyed to the uttermost part of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3200",5160,"dominions.  And experienced guides, and the chief men of his country,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3201",5160,"went with him.  And the furthermost point that they showed him he kept","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3202",5160,"possession of.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3203",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3204",5160,"And, as he had been used to do when he was at Arthur’s Court, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3205",5160,"frequented tournaments.  And he became acquainted with valiant and mighty","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3206",5160,"men, until he had gained as much fame there as he had formerly done","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3207",5160,"elsewhere.  And he enriched his Court, and his companions, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3208",5160,"nobles, with the best horses and the best arms, and with the best and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3209",5160,"most valuable jewels, and he ceased not until his fame had flown over the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3210",5160,"face of the whole kingdom.  And when he knew that it was thus, he began","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3211",5160,"to love ease and pleasure, for there was no one who was worth his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3212",5160,"opposing.  And he loved his wife, and liked to continue in the palace,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3213",5160,"with minstrelsy and diversions.  And for a long time he abode at home.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3214",5160,"And after that he began to shut himself up in the chamber of his wife,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3215",5160,"and he took no delight in anything besides, insomuch that he gave up the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3216",5160,"friendship of his nobles, together with his hunting and his amusements,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3217",5160,"and lost the hearts of all the host in his Court; and there was murmuring","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3218",5160,"and scoffing concerning him among the inhabitants of the palace, on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3219",5160,"account of his relinquishing so completely their companionship for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3220",5160,"love of his wife.  And these tidings came to Erbin.  And when Erbin had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3221",5160,"heard these things, he spoke unto Enid, and inquired of her whether it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3222",5160,"was she that had caused Geraint to act thus, and to forsake his people","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3223",5160,"and his hosts.  “Not I, by my confession unto Heaven,” said she, “there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3224",5160,"is nothing more hateful to me than this.”  And she knew not what she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3225",5160,"should do, for, although it was hard for her to own this to Geraint, yet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3226",5160,"was it not more easy for her to listen to what she heard, without warning","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3227",5160,"Geraint concerning it.  And she was very sorrowful.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3228",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3229",5160,"And one morning in the summer time, they were upon their couch, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3230",5160,"Geraint lay upon the edge of it.  And Enid was without sleep in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3231",5160,"apartment, which had windows of glass.  And the sun shone upon the couch.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3232",5160,"And the clothes had slipped from off his arms and his breast, and he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3233",5160,"asleep.  Then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his appearance, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3234",5160,"she said, “Alas, and am I the cause that these arms and this breast have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3235",5160,"lost their glory and the warlike fame which they once so richly enjoyed!”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3236",5160,"And as she said this, the tears dropped from her eyes, and they fell upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3237",5160,"his breast.  And the tears she shed, and the words she had spoken, awoke","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3238",5160,"him; and another thing contributed to awaken him, and that was the idea","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3239",5160,"that it was not in thinking of him that she spoke thus, but that it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3240",5160,"because she loved some other man more than him, and that she wished for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3241",5160,"other society, and thereupon Geraint was troubled in his mind, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3242",5160,"called his squire; and when he came to him, “Go quickly,” said he, “and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3243",5160,"prepare my horse and my arms, and make them ready.  And do thou arise,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3244",5160,"said he to Enid, “and apparel thyself; and cause thy horse to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3245",5160,"accoutred, and clothe thee in the worst riding-dress that thou hast in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3246",5160,"thy possession.  And evil betide me,” said he, “if thou returnest here","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3247",5160,"until thou knowest whether I have lost my strength so completely as thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3248",5160,"didst say.  And if it be so, it will then be easy for thee to seek the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3249",5160,"society thou didst wish for of him of whom thou wast thinking.”  So she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3250",5160,"arose, and clothed herself in her meanest garments.  “I know nothing,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3251",5160,"Lord,” said she, “of thy meaning.”  “Neither wilt thou know at this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3252",5160,"time,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3253",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3254",5160,"Then Geraint went to see Erbin.  “Sir,” said he, “I am going upon a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3255",5160,"quest, and I am not certain when I may come back.  Take heed, therefore,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3256",5160,"unto thy possessions, until my return.”  “I will do so,” said he, “but it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3257",5160,"is strange to me that thou shouldest go so suddenly.  And who will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3258",5160,"proceed with thee, since thou art not strong enough to traverse the land","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3259",5160,"of Lloegyr alone?”  “But one person only will go with me.”  “Heaven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3260",5160,"counsel thee, my son,” said Erbin, “and may many attach themselves to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3261",5160,"thee in Lloegyr.”  Then went Geraint to the place where his horse was,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3262",5160,"and it was equipped with foreign armour, heavy and shining.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3263",5160,"desired Enid to mount her horse, and to ride forward, and to keep a long","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3264",5160,"way before him.  “And whatever thou mayest see, and whatever thou mayest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3265",5160,"hear concerning me,” said he, “do thou not turn back.  And unless I speak","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3266",5160,"unto thee, say not thou one word either.”  And they set forward.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3267",5160,"did not choose the pleasantest and most frequented road, but that which","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3268",5160,"was the wildest and most beset by thieves, and robbers, and venomous","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3269",5160,"animals.  And they came to a high road, which they followed till they saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3270",5160,"a vast forest, and they went towards it, and they saw four armed horsemen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3271",5160,"come forth from the forest.  When the horsemen had beheld them, one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3272",5160,"them said to the others, “Behold, here is a good occasion for us to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3273",5160,"capture two horses and armour, and a lady likewise; for this we shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3274",5160,"have no difficulty in doing against yonder single knight, who hangs his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3275",5160,"head so pensively and heavily.”  And Enid heard this discourse, and she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3276",5160,"knew not what she should do through fear of Geraint, who had told her to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3277",5160,"be silent.  “The vengeance of Heaven be upon me,” she said, “if I would","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3278",5160,"not rather receive my death from his hand than from the hand of any","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3279",5160,"other; and though he should slay me yet will I speak to him, lest I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3280",5160,"should have the misery to witness his death.”  So she waited for Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3281",5160,"until he came near to her.  “Lord,” said she, “didst thou hear the words","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3282",5160,"of those men concerning thee?”  Then he lifted up his eyes, and looked at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3283",5160,"her angrily.  “Thou hadst only,” said he, “to hold thy peace as I bade","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3284",5160,"thee.  I wish but for silence, and not for warning.  And though thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3285",5160,"shouldest desire to see my defeat and my death by the hands of those men,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3286",5160,"yet do I feel no dread.”  Then the foremost of them couched his lance,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3287",5160,"and rushed upon Geraint.  And he received him, and that not feebly.  But","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3288",5160,"he let the thrust go by him, while he struck the horseman upon the centre","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3289",5160,"of his shield in such a manner that his shield was split, and his armour","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3290",5160,"broken, and so that a cubit’s length of the shaft of Geraint’s lance","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3291",5160,"passed through his body, and sent him to the earth, the length of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3292",5160,"lance over his horse’s crupper.  Then the second horseman attacked him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3293",5160,"furiously, being wroth at the death of his companion.  But with one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3294",5160,"thrust Geraint overthrew him also, and killed him as he had done the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3295",5160,"other.  Then the third set upon him, and he killed him in like manner.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3296",5160,"And thus also he slew the fourth.  Sad and sorrowful was the maiden as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3297",5160,"she saw all this.  Geraint dismounted from his horse, and took the arms","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3298",5160,"of the men he had slain, and placed them upon their saddles, and tied","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3299",5160,"together the reins of their horses, and he mounted his horse again.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3300",5160,"“Behold what thou must do,” said he; “take the four horses, and drive","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3301",5160,"them before thee, and proceed forward, as I bade thee just now.  And say","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3302",5160,"not one word unto me, unless I speak first unto thee.  And I declare unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3303",5160,"Heaven,” said he, “if thou doest not thus, it will be to thy cost.”  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3304",5160,"will do, as far as I can, Lord,” said she, “according to thy desire.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3305",5160,"Then they went forward through the forest; and when they left the forest,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3306",5160,"they came to a vast plain, in the centre of which was a group of thickly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3307",5160,"tangled copse-wood; and from out thereof they beheld three horsemen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3308",5160,"coming towards them, well equipped with armour, both they and their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3309",5160,"horses.  Then the maiden looked steadfastly upon them; and when they had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3310",5160,"come near, she heard them say one to another, “Behold, here is a good","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3311",5160,"arrival for us; here are coming for us four horses and four suits of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3312",5160,"armour.  We shall easily obtain them spite of yonder dolorous knight, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3313",5160,"the maiden also will fall into our power.”  “This is but too true,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3314",5160,"she to herself, “for my husband is tired with his former combat.  The","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3315",5160,"vengeance of Heaven will be upon me, unless I warn him of this.”  So the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3316",5160,"maiden waited until Geraint came up to her.  “Lord,” said she, “dust thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3317",5160,"not hear the discourse of yonder men concerning thee?”  “What was it?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3318",5160,"asked he.  “They say to one another, that they will easily obtain all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3319",5160,"this spoil.”  “I declare to Heaven,” he answered, “that their words are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3320",5160,"less grievous to me than that thou wilt not be silent, and abide by my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3321",5160,"counsel.”  “My Lord,” said she, “I feared lest they should surprise thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3322",5160,"unawares.”  “Hold thy peace, then,” said he, “do not I desire silence?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3323",5160,"And thereupon one of the horsemen couched his lance, and attacked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3324",5160,"Geraint.  And he made a thrust at him, which he thought would be very","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3325",5160,"effective; but Geraint received it carelessly, and struck it aside, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3326",5160,"then he rushed upon him, and aimed at the centre of his person, and from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3327",5160,"the shock of man and horse, the quantity of his armour did not avail him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3328",5160,"and the head of the lance and part of the shaft passed through him, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3329",5160,"that he was carried to the ground an arm and a spear’s length over the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3330",5160,"crupper of his horse.  And both the other horsemen came forward in their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3331",5160,"turn, but their onset was not more successful than that of their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3332",5160,"companion.  And the maiden stood by, looking at all this; and on the one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3333",5160,"hand she was in trouble lest Geraint should be wounded in his encounter","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3334",5160,"with the men, and on the other hand she was joyful to see him victorious.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3335",5160,"Then Geraint dismounted, and bound the three suits of armour upon the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3336",5160,"three saddles, and he fastened the reins of all the horses together, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3337",5160,"that he had seven horses with him.  And he mounted his own horse, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3338",5160,"commanded the maiden to drive forward the others.  “It is no more use for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3339",5160,"me to speak to thee than to refrain, for thou wilt not attend to my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3340",5160,"advice.”  “I will do so, as far as I am able, Lord,” said she; “but I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3341",5160,"cannot conceal from thee the fierce and threatening words which I may","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3342",5160,"hear against thee, Lord, from such strange people as those that haunt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3343",5160,"this wilderness.”  “I declare to Heaven,” said he, “that I desire nought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3344",5160,"but silence; therefore, hold thy peace.”  “I will, Lord, while I can.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3345",5160,"And the maiden went on with the horses before her, and she pursued her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3346",5160,"way straight onwards.  And from the copse-wood already mentioned, they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3347",5160,"journeyed over a vast and dreary open plain.  And at a great distance","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3348",5160,"from them they beheld a wood, and they could see neither end nor boundary","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3349",5160,"to the wood, except on that side that was nearest to them, and they went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3350",5160,"towards it.  Then there came from out the wood five horsemen, eager, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3351",5160,"bold, and mighty, and strong, mounted upon chargers that were powerful,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3352",5160,"and large of bone, and high-mettled, and proudly snorting, and both the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3353",5160,"men and the horses were well equipped with arms.  And when they drew near","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3354",5160,"to them, Enid heard them say, “Behold, here is a fine booty coming to us,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3355",5160,"which we shall obtain easily and without labour, for we shall have no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3356",5160,"trouble in taking all those horses and arms, and the lady also, from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3357",5160,"yonder single knight, so doleful and sad.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3358",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3359",5160,"Sorely grieved was the maiden upon hearing this discourse, so that she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3360",5160,"knew not in the world what she should do.  At last, however, she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3361",5160,"determined to warn Geraint; so she turned her horse’s head towards him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3362",5160,"“Lord,” said she, “if thou hadst heard as I did what yonder horsemen said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3363",5160,"concerning thee, thy heaviness would be greater than it is.”  Angrily and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3364",5160,"bitterly did Geraint smile upon her, and he said, “Thee do I hear doing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3365",5160,"everything that I forbade thee; but it may be that thou will repent this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3366",5160,"yet.”  And immediately, behold, the men met them, and victoriously and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3367",5160,"gallantly did Geraint overcome them all five.  And he placed the five","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3368",5160,"suits of armour upon the five saddles, and tied together the reins of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3369",5160,"twelve horses, and gave them in charge to Enid.  “I know not,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3370",5160,"“what good it is for me to order thee; but this time I charge thee in an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3371",5160,"especial manner.”  So the maiden went forward towards the wood, keeping","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3372",5160,"in advance of Geraint, as he had desired her; and it grieved him as much","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3373",5160,"as his wrath would permit, to see a maiden so illustrious as she having","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3374",5160,"so much trouble with the care of the horses.  Then they reached the wood,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3375",5160,"and it was both deep and vast; and in the wood night overtook them.  “Ah,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3376",5160,"maiden,” said he, “it is vain to attempt proceeding forward!”  “Well,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3377",5160,"Lord,” said she, “whatsoever thou wishest, we will do.”  “It will be best","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3378",5160,"for us,” he answered, “to turn out of the wood, and to rest, and wait for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3379",5160,"the day, in order to pursue our journey.”  “That will we, gladly,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3380",5160,"she.  And they did so.  Having dismounted himself, he took her down from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3381",5160,"her horse.  “I cannot, by any means, refrain from sleep, through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3382",5160,"weariness,” said he.  “Do thou, therefore, watch the horses, and sleep","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3383",5160,"not.”  “I will, Lord,” said she.  Then he went to sleep in his armour,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3384",5160,"and thus passed the night, which was not long at that season.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3385",5160,"she saw the dawn of day appear, she looked around her, to see if he were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3386",5160,"waking, and thereupon he woke.  “My Lord,” she said, “I have desired to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3387",5160,"awake thee for some time.”  But he spake nothing to her about fatigue, as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3388",5160,"he had desired her to be silent.  Then he arose, and said unto her, “Take","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3389",5160,"the horses, and ride on; and keep straight on before thee as thou didst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3390",5160,"yesterday.”  And early in the day they left the wood, and they came to an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3391",5160,"open country, with meadows on one hand, and mowers mowing the meadows.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3392",5160,"And there was a river before them, and the horses bent down, and drank","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3393",5160,"the water.  And they went up out of the river by a lofty steep; and there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3394",5160,"they met a slender stripling, with a satchel about his neck, and they saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3395",5160,"that there was something in the satchel, but they knew not what it was.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3396",5160,"And he had a small blue pitcher in his hand, and a bowl on the mouth of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3397",5160,"the pitcher.  And the youth saluted Geraint.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3398",5160,"Geraint, “and whence dost thou come?”  “I come,” said he, “from the city","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3399",5160,"that lies before thee.  My Lord,” he added, “will it be displeasing to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3400",5160,"thee if I ask whence thou comest also?”  “By no means—through yonder wood","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3401",5160,"did I come.”  “Thou camest not through the wood to-day.”  “No,” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3402",5160,"replied, “we were in the wood last night.”  “I warrant,” said the youth,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3403",5160,"“that thy condition there last night was not the most pleasant, and that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3404",5160,"thou hadst neither meat nor drink.”  “No, by my faith,” said he.  “Wilt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3405",5160,"thou follow my counsel,” said the youth, “and take thy meal from me?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3406",5160,"“What sort of meal?” he inquired.  “The breakfast which is sent for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3407",5160,"yonder mowers, nothing less than bread and meat and wine; and if thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3408",5160,"wilt, Sir, they shall have none of it.”  “I will,” said he, “and Heaven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3409",5160,"reward thee for it.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3410",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3411",5160,"So Geraint alighted, and the youth took the maiden from off her horse.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3412",5160,"Then they washed, and took their repast.  And the youth cut the bread in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3413",5160,"slices, and gave them drink, and served them withal.  And when they had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3414",5160,"finished, the youth arose, and said to Geraint, “My Lord, with thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3415",5160,"permission, I will now go and fetch some food for the mowers.”  “Go,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3416",5160,"first, to the town,” said Geraint, “and take a lodging for me in the best","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3417",5160,"place that thou knowest, and the most commodious one for the horses, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3418",5160,"take thou whichever horse and arms thou choosest in payment for thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3419",5160,"service and thy gift.”  “Heaven reward thee, Lord,” said the youth, “and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3420",5160,"this would be ample to repay services much greater than those I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3421",5160,"rendered unto thee.”  And to the town went the youth, and he took the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3422",5160,"best and the most pleasant lodgings that he knew; and after that he went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3423",5160,"to the palace, having the horse and armour with him, and proceeded to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3424",5160,"place where the Earl was, and told him all his adventure.  “I go now,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3425",5160,"Lord,” said he, “to meet the young man, and to conduct him to his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3426",5160,"lodging.”  “Go, gladly,” said the Earl, “and right joyfully shall he be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3427",5160,"received here, if he so come.”  And the youth went to meet Geraint, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3428",5160,"told him that he would be received gladly by the Earl in his own palace;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3429",5160,"but he would go only to his lodgings.  And he had a goodly chamber, in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3430",5160,"which was plenty of straw, and drapery, and a spacious and commodious","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3431",5160,"place he had for the horses; and the youth prepared for them plenty of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3432",5160,"provender.  And after they had disarrayed themselves, Geraint spoke thus","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3433",5160,"to Enid: “Go,” said he, “to the other side of the chamber, and come not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3434",5160,"to this side of the house; and thou mayest call to thee the woman of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3435",5160,"house, if thou wilt.”  “I will do, Lord,” said she, “as thou sayest.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3436",5160,"And thereupon the man of the house came to Geraint, and welcomed him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3437",5160,"“Oh, chieftain,” he said, “hast thou taken thy meal?”  “I have,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3438",5160,"Then the youth spoke to him, and inquired if he would not drink something","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3439",5160,"before he met the Earl.  “Truly I will,” said he.  So the youth went into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3440",5160,"the town, and brought them drink.  And they drank.  “I must needs sleep,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3441",5160,"said Geraint.  “Well,” said the youth; “and whilst thou sleepest, I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3442",5160,"go to see the Earl.”  “Go, gladly,” he said, “and come here again when I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3443",5160,"require thee.”  And Geraint went to sleep; and so did Enid also.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3444",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3445",5160,"And the youth came to the place where the Earl was, and the Earl asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3446",5160,"him where the lodgings of the knight were, and he told him.  “I must go,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3447",5160,"said the youth, “to wait on him in the evening.”  “Go,” answered the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3448",5160,"Earl, “and greet him well from me, and tell him that in the evening I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3449",5160,"will go to see him.”  “This will I do,” said the youth.  So he came when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3450",5160,"it was time for them to awake.  And they arose, and went forth.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3451",5160,"it was time for them to take their food, they took it.  And the youth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3452",5160,"served them.  And Geraint inquired of the man of the house, whether there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3453",5160,"were any of his companions that he wished to invite to him, and he said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3454",5160,"that there were.  “Bring them hither, and entertain them at my cost with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3455",5160,"the best thou canst buy in the town.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3456",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3457",5160,"And the man of the house brought there those whom he chose, and feasted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3458",5160,"them at Geraint’s expense.  Thereupon, behold, the Earl came to visit","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3459",5160,"Geraint, and his twelve honourable knights with him.  And Geraint rose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3460",5160,"up, and welcomed him.  “Heaven preserve thee,” said the Earl.  Then they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3461",5160,"all sat down according to their precedence in honour.  And the Earl","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3462",5160,"conversed with Geraint, and inquired of him the object of his journey.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3463",5160,"“I have none,” he replied, “but to seek adventures, and to follow my own","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3464",5160,"inclination.”  Then the Earl cast his eye upon Enid, and he looked at her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3465",5160,"steadfastly.  And he thought he had never seen a maiden fairer or more","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3466",5160,"comely than she.  And he set all his thoughts and his affections upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3467",5160,"her.  Then he asked of Geraint, “Have I thy permission to go and converse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3468",5160,"with yonder maiden, for I see that she is apart from thee?”  “Thou hast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3469",5160,"it gladly,” said he.  So the Earl went to the place where the maiden was,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3470",5160,"and spake with her.  “Ah, maiden,” said he, “it cannot be pleasant to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3471",5160,"thee to journey thus with yonder man!”  “It is not unpleasant to me,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3472",5160,"said she, “to journey the same road that he journeys.”  “Thou hast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3473",5160,"neither youths nor maidens to serve thee,” said he.  “Truly,” she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3474",5160,"replied, “it is more pleasant for me to follow yonder man, than to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3475",5160,"served by youths and maidens.”  “I will give thee good counsel,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3476",5160,"“All my Earldom will I place in thy possession, if thou wilt dwell with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3477",5160,"me.”  “That will I not, by Heaven,” she said; “yonder man was the first","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3478",5160,"to whom my faith was ever pledged; and shall I prove inconstant to him!”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3479",5160,"“Thou art in the wrong,” said the Earl; “if I slay the man yonder, I can","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3480",5160,"keep thee with me as long as I choose; and when thou no longer pleasest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3481",5160,"me I can turn thee away.  But if thou goest with me by thine own good","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3482",5160,"will, I protest that our union shall continue eternal and undivided as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3483",5160,"long as I remain alive.”  Then she pondered these words of his, and she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3484",5160,"considered that it was advisable to encourage him in his request.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3485",5160,"“Behold, then, chieftain, this is most expedient for thee to do to save","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3486",5160,"me any needless imputation; come here to-morrow, and take me away as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3487",5160,"though I knew nothing thereof.”  “I will do so,” said he.  So he arose,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3488",5160,"and took his leave, and went forth with his attendants.  And she told not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3489",5160,"then to Geraint any of the conversation which she had had with the Earl,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3490",5160,"lest it should rouse his anger, and cause him uneasiness and care.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3491",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3492",5160,"And at the usual hour they went to sleep.  And at the beginning of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3493",5160,"night Enid slept a little; and at midnight she arose, and placed all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3494",5160,"Geraint’s armour together, so that it might be ready to put on.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3495",5160,"although fearful of her errand, she came to the side of Geraint’s bed;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3496",5160,"and she spoke to him softly and gently, saying, “My Lord, arise, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3497",5160,"clothe thyself, for these were the words of the Earl to me, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3498",5160,"intention concerning me.”  So she told Geraint all that had passed.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3499",5160,"although he was wroth with her, he took warning, and clothed himself.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3500",5160,"And she lighted a candle, that he might have light to do so.  “Leave","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3501",5160,"there the candle,” said he, “and desire the man of the house to come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3502",5160,"here.”  Then she went, and the man of the house came to him.  “Dost thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3503",5160,"know how much I owe thee?” asked Geraint.  “I think thou owest but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3504",5160,"little.”  “Take the eleven horses and the eleven suits of armour.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3505",5160,"“Heaven reward thee, lord,” said he, “but I spent not the value of one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3506",5160,"suit of armour upon thee.”  “For that reason,” said he, “thou wilt be the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3507",5160,"richer.  And now, wilt thou come to guide me out of the town?”  “I will,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3508",5160,"gladly,” said he, “and in which direction dost thou intend to go?”  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3509",5160,"wish to leave the town by a different way from that by which I entered","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3510",5160,"it.”  So the man of the lodgings accompanied him as far as he desired.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3511",5160,"Then he bade the maiden to go on before him; and she did so, and went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3512",5160,"straight forward, and his host returned home.  And he had only just","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3513",5160,"reached his house, when, behold, the greatest tumult approached that was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3514",5160,"ever heard.  And when he looked out, he saw fourscore knights in complete","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3515",5160,"armour around the house, with the Earl Dwnn at their head.  “Where is the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3516",5160,"knight that was here?” said the Earl.  “By thy hand,” said he, “he went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3517",5160,"hence some time ago.”  “Wherefore, villain,” said he, “didst thou let him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3518",5160,"go without informing me?”  “My Lord, thou didst not command me to do so,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3519",5160,"else would I not have allowed him to depart.”  “What way dost thou think","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3520",5160,"that he took?”  “I know not, except that he went along the high road.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3521",5160,"And they turned their horses’ heads that way, and seeing the tracks of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3522",5160,"the horses upon the high road, they followed.  And when the maiden beheld","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3523",5160,"the dawning of the day, she looked behind her, and saw vast clouds of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3524",5160,"dust coming nearer and nearer to her.  And thereupon she became uneasy,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3525",5160,"and she thought that it was the Earl and his host coming after them.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3526",5160,"thereupon she beheld a knight appearing through the mist.  “By my faith,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3527",5160,"said she, “though he should slay me, it were better for me to receive my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3528",5160,"death at his hands, than to see him killed without warning him.  My","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3529",5160,"Lord,” she said to him, “seest thou yonder man hastening after thee, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3530",5160,"many others with him?”  “I do see him,” said he; “and in despite of all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3531",5160,"my orders, I see that thou wilt never keep silence.”  Then he turned upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3532",5160,"the knight, and with the first thrust he threw him down under his horse’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3533",5160,"feet.  And as long as there remained one of the fourscore knights, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3534",5160,"overthrew every one of them at the first onset.  And from the weakest to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3535",5160,"the strongest, they all attacked him one after the other, except the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3536",5160,"Earl: and last of all the Earl came against him also.  And he broke his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3537",5160,"lance, and then he broke a second.  But Geraint turned upon him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3538",5160,"struck him with his lance upon the centre of his shield, so that by that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3539",5160,"single thrust the shield was split, and all his armour broken, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3540",5160,"himself was brought over his horse’s crupper to the ground, and was in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3541",5160,"peril of his life.  And Geraint drew near to him; and at the noise of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3542",5160,"trampling of his horse the Earl revived.  “Mercy, Lord,” said he to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3543",5160,"Geraint.  And Geraint granted him mercy.  But through the hardness of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3544",5160,"ground where they had fallen, and the violence of the stroke which they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3545",5160,"had received, there was not a single knight amongst them that escaped","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3546",5160,"without receiving a fall, mortally severe, and grievously painful, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3547",5160,"desperately wounding, from the hand of Geraint.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3548",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3549",5160,"And Geraint journeyed along the high road that was before him, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3550",5160,"maiden went on first; and near them they beheld a valley which was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3551",5160,"fairest ever seen, and which had a large river running through it; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3552",5160,"there was a bridge over the river, and the high road led to the bridge.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3553",5160,"And above the bridge upon the opposite side of the river, they beheld a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3554",5160,"fortified town, the fairest ever seen.  And as they approached the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3555",5160,"bridge, Geraint saw coming towards him from a thick copse a man mounted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3556",5160,"upon a large and lofty steed, even of pace and spirited though tractable.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3557",5160,"“Ah, knight,” said Geraint, “whence comest thou?”  “I come,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3558",5160,"“from the valley below us.”  “Canst thou tell me,” said Geraint, “who is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3559",5160,"the owner of this fair valley and yonder walled town?”  “I will tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3560",5160,"thee, willingly,” said he.  “Gwiffert Petit he is called by the Franks,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3561",5160,"but the Cymry call him the Little King.”  “Can I go by yonder bridge,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3562",5160,"said Geraint, “and by the lower highway that is beneath the town?”  Said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3563",5160,"the knight, “Thou canst not go by his tower on the other side of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3564",5160,"bridge, unless thou dost intend to combat him; because it is his custom","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3565",5160,"to encounter every knight that comes upon his lands.”  “I declare to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3566",5160,"Heaven,” said Geraint, “that I will, nevertheless, pursue my journey that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3567",5160,"way.”  “If thou dost so,” said the knight, “thou wilt probably meet with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3568",5160,"shame and disgrace in reward for thy daring.”  Then Geraint proceeded","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3569",5160,"along the road that led to the town, and the road brought him to a ground","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3570",5160,"that was hard, and rugged, and high, and ridgy.  And as he journeyed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3571",5160,"thus, he beheld a knight following him upon a warhorse, strong, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3572",5160,"large, and proudly-stepping, and wide-hoofed, and broad-chested.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3573",5160,"never saw a man of smaller stature than he who was upon the horse.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3574",5160,"both he and his horse were completely armed.  When he had overtaken","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3575",5160,"Geraint, he said to him, “Tell me, chieftain, whether it is through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3576",5160,"ignorance or through presumption that thou seekest to insult my dignity,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3577",5160,"and to infringe my rules.”  “Nay,” answered Geraint, “I knew not this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3578",5160,"road was forbid to any.”  “Thou didst know it,” said the other; “come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3579",5160,"with me to my Court, to give me satisfaction.”  “That will I not, by my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3580",5160,"faith,” said Geraint; “I would not go even to thy Lord’s Court, excepting","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3581",5160,"Arthur were thy Lord.”  “By the hand of Arthur himself,” said the knight,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3582",5160,"“I will have satisfaction of thee, or receive my overthrow at thy hands.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3583",5160,"And immediately they charged one another.  And a squire of his came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3584",5160,"serve him with lances as he broke them.  And they gave each other such","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3585",5160,"hard and severe strokes that their shields lost all their colour.  But it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3586",5160,"was very difficult for Geraint to fight with him on account of his small","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3587",5160,"size, for he was hardly able to get a full aim at him with all the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3588",5160,"efforts he could make.  And they fought thus until their horses were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3589",5160,"brought down upon their knees; and at length Geraint threw the knight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3590",5160,"headlong to the ground; and then they fought on foot, and they gave one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3591",5160,"another blows so boldly fierce, so frequent, and so severely powerful,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3592",5160,"that their helmets were pierced, and their skullcaps were broken, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3593",5160,"their arms were shattered, and the light of their eyes was darkened by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3594",5160,"sweat and blood.  At the last Geraint became enraged, and he called to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3595",5160,"him all his strength; and boldly angry, and swiftly resolute, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3596",5160,"furiously determined, he lifted up his sword, and struck him on the crown","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3597",5160,"of his head a blow so mortally painful, so violent, so fierce, and so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3598",5160,"penetrating, that it cut through all his head armour, and his skin, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3599",5160,"his flesh, until it wounded the very bone, and the sword flew out of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3600",5160,"hand of the Little King to the furthest end of the plain, and he besought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3601",5160,"Geraint that he would have mercy and compassion upon him.  “Though thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3602",5160,"hast been neither courteous nor just,” said Geraint, “thou shalt have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3603",5160,"mercy, upon condition that thou wilt become my ally, and engage never to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3604",5160,"fight against me again, but to come to my assistance whenever thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3605",5160,"hearest of my being in trouble.”  “This will I do, gladly, Lord,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3606",5160,"he.  So he pledged him his faith thereof.  “And now, Lord, come with me,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3607",5160,"said he, “to my Court yonder, to recover from thy weariness and fatigue.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3608",5160,"“That will I not, by Heaven,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3609",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3610",5160,"Then Gwiffert Petit beheld Enid where she stood, and it grieved him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3611",5160,"see one of her noble mien appear so deeply afflicted.  And he said to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3612",5160,"Geraint, “My Lord, thou doest wrong not to take repose, and refresh","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3613",5160,"thyself awhile; for, if thou meetest with any difficulty in thy present","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3614",5160,"condition, it will not be easy for thee to surmount it.”  But Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3615",5160,"would do no other than proceed on his journey, and he mounted his horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3616",5160,"in pain, and all covered with blood.  And the maiden went on first, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3617",5160,"they proceeded towards the wood which they saw before them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3618",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3619",5160,"And the heat of the sun was very great, and through the blood and sweat,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3620",5160,"Geraint’s armour cleaved to his flesh; and when they came into the wood,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3621",5160,"he stood under a tree, to avoid the sun’s heat; and his wounds pained him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3622",5160,"more than they had done at the time when he received them.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3623",5160,"maiden stood under another tree.  And lo! they heard the sound of horns,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3624",5160,"and a tumultuous noise; and the occasion of it was, that Arthur and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3625",5160,"company had come down to the wood.  And while Geraint was considering","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3626",5160,"which way he should go to avoid them, behold, he was espied by a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3627",5160,"foot-page, who was an attendant on the Steward of the Household; and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3628",5160,"went to the Steward, and told him what kind of man he had seen in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3629",5160,"wood.  Then the Steward caused his horse to be saddled, and he took his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3630",5160,"lance and his shield, and went to the place where Geraint was.  “Ah,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3631",5160,"knight!” said he, “what dost thou here?”  “I am standing under a shady","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3632",5160,"tree, to avoid the heat and the rays of the sun.”  “Wherefore is thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3633",5160,"journey, and who art thou?”  “I seek adventures, and go where I list.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3634",5160,"“Indeed,” said Kai; “then come with me to see Arthur, who is here hard","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3635",5160,"by.”  “That will I not, by Heaven,” said Geraint.  “Thou must needs","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3636",5160,"come,” said Kai.  Then Geraint knew who he was, but Kai did not know","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3637",5160,"Geraint.  And Kai attacked Geraint as best he could.  And Geraint became","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3638",5160,"wroth, and he struck him with the shaft of his lance, so that he rolled","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3639",5160,"headlong to the ground.  But chastisement worse than this would he not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3640",5160,"inflict on him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3641",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3642",5160,"Scared and wildly Kai arose, and he mounted his horse, and went back to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3643",5160,"his lodging.  And thence he proceeded to Gwalchmai’s tent.  “Oh, Sir,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3644",5160,"said he to Gwalchmai, “I was told by one of the attendants, that he saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3645",5160,"in the wood above a wounded knight, having on battered armour; and if","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3646",5160,"thou dost right, thou wilt go and see if this be true.”  “I care not if I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3647",5160,"do so,” said Gwalchmai.  “Take, then, thy horse, and some of thy armour,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3648",5160,"said Kai; “for I hear that he is not over courteous to those who approach","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3649",5160,"him.”  So Gwalchmai took his spear and his shield, and mounted his horse,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3650",5160,"and came to the spot where Geraint was.  “Sir Knight,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3651",5160,"“wherefore is thy journey?”  “I journey for my own pleasure, and to seek","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3652",5160,"the adventures of the world.”  “Wilt thou tell me who thou art; or wilt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3653",5160,"thou come and visit Arthur, who is near at hand?”  “I will make no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3654",5160,"alliance with thee, nor will I go and visit Arthur,” said he.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3655",5160,"knew that it was Gwalchmai, but Gwalchmai knew him not.  “I purpose not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3656",5160,"to leave thee,” said Gwalchmai, “till I know who thou art.”  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3657",5160,"charged him with his lance, and struck him on his shield, so that the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3658",5160,"shaft was shivered into splinters, and their horses were front to front.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3659",5160,"Then Gwalchmai gazed fixedly upon him, and he knew him.  “Ah, Geraint,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3660",5160,"said he, “is it thou that art here?”  “I am not Geraint,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3661",5160,"“Geraint thou art, by Heaven,” he replied, “and a wretched and insane","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3662",5160,"expedition is this.”  Then he looked around, and beheld Enid, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3663",5160,"welcomed her gladly.  “Geraint,” said Gwalchmai, “come thou and see","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3664",5160,"Arthur; he is thy lord and thy cousin.”  “I will not,” said he, “for I am","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3665",5160,"not in a fit state to go and see any one.”  Thereupon, behold, one of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3666",5160,"pages came after Gwalchmai to speak to him.  So he sent him to apprise","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3667",5160,"Arthur that Geraint was there wounded, and that he would not go to visit","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3668",5160,"him, and that it was pitiable to see the plight that he was in.  And this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3669",5160,"he did without Geraint’s knowledge, inasmuch as he spoke in a whisper to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3670",5160,"the page.  “Entreat Arthur,” said he, “to have his tent brought near to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3671",5160,"the road, for he will not meet him willingly, and it is not easy to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3672",5160,"compel him in the mood he is in.”  So the page came to Arthur, and told","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3673",5160,"him this.  And he caused his tent to be removed unto the side of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3674",5160,"road.  And the maiden rejoiced in her heart.  And Gwalchmai led Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3675",5160,"onwards along the road, till they came to the place where Arthur was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3676",5160,"encamped, and the pages were pitching his tent by the roadside.  “Lord,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3677",5160,"said Geraint, “all hail unto thee.”  “Heaven prosper thee; and who art","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3678",5160,"thou?” said Arthur.  “It is Geraint,” said Gwalchmai, “and of his own","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3679",5160,"free will would he not come to meet thee.”  “Verily,” said Arthur, “he is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3680",5160,"bereft of his reason.”  Then came Enid, and saluted Arthur.  “Heaven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3681",5160,"protect thee,” said he.  And thereupon he caused one of the pages to take","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3682",5160,"her from her horse.  “Alas! Enid,” said Arthur, “what expedition is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3683",5160,"this?”  “I know not, Lord,” said she, “save that it behoves me to journey","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3684",5160,"by the same road that he journeys.”  “My Lord,” said Geraint, “with thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3685",5160,"permission we will depart.”  “Whither wilt thou go?” said Arthur.  “Thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3686",5160,"canst not proceed now, unless it be unto thy death.”  “He will not suffer","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3687",5160,"himself to be invited by me,” said Gwalchmai.  “But by me he will,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3688",5160,"Arthur; “and, moreover, he does not go from here until he is healed.”  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3689",5160,"had rather, Lord,” said Geraint, “that thou wouldest let me go forth.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3690",5160,"“That will I not, I declare to Heaven,” said he.  Then he caused a maiden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3691",5160,"to be sent for to conduct Enid to the tent where Gwenhwyvar’s chamber","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3692",5160,"was.  And Gwenhwyvar and all her women were joyful at her coming; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3693",5160,"they took off her riding-dress, and placed other garments upon her.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3694",5160,"Arthur also called Kadyrieith, and ordered him to pitch a tent for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3695",5160,"Geraint and the physicians; and he enjoined him to provide him with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3696",5160,"abundance of all that might be requisite for him.  And Kadyrieith did as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3697",5160,"he had commanded him.  And Morgan Tud and his disciples were brought to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3698",5160,"Geraint.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3699",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3700",5160,"And Arthur and his hosts remained there nearly a month, whilst Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3701",5160,"was being healed.  And when he was fully recovered, Geraint came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3702",5160,"Arthur, and asked his permission to depart.  “I know not if thou art","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3703",5160,"quite well.”  “In truth I am, Lord,” said Geraint.  “I shall not believe","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3704",5160,"thee concerning that, but the physicians that were with thee.”  So Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3705",5160,"caused the physicians to be summoned to him, and asked them if it were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3706",5160,"true.  “It is true, Lord,” said Morgan Tud.  So the next day Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3707",5160,"permitted him to go forth, and he pursued his journey.  And on the same","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3708",5160,"day Arthur removed thence.  And Geraint desired Enid to go on, and to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3709",5160,"keep before him, as she had formerly done.  And she went forward along","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3710",5160,"the high road.  And as they journeyed thus, they heard an exceeding loud","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3711",5160,"wailing near to them.  “Stay thou here,” said he, “and I will go and see","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3712",5160,"what is the cause of this wailing.”  “I will,” said she.  Then he went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3713",5160,"forward unto an open glade that was near the road.  And in the glade he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3714",5160,"saw two horses, one having a man’s saddle, and the other a woman’s saddle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3715",5160,"upon it.  And, behold, there was a knight lying dead in his armour, and a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3716",5160,"young damsel in a riding-dress standing over him, lamenting.  “Ah! Lady,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3717",5160,"said Geraint, “what hath befallen thee?”  “Behold,” she answered, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3718",5160,"journeyed here with my beloved husband, when, lo! three giants came upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3719",5160,"us, and without any cause in the world, they slew him.”  “Which way went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3720",5160,"they hence?” said Geraint.  “Yonder by the high road,” she replied.  So","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3721",5160,"he returned to Enid.  “Go,” said he, “to the lady that is below yonder,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3722",5160,"and await me there till I come.”  She was sad when he ordered her to do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3723",5160,"thus, but nevertheless she went to the damsel, whom it was ruth to hear,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3724",5160,"and she felt certain that Geraint would never return.  Meanwhile Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3725",5160,"followed the giants, and overtook them.  And each of them was greater of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3726",5160,"stature than three other men, and a huge club was on the shoulder of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3727",5160,"each.  Then he rushed upon one of them, and thrust his lance through his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3728",5160,"body.  And having drawn it forth again, he pierced another of them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3729",5160,"through likewise.  But the third turned upon him, and struck him with his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3730",5160,"club, so that he split his shield, and crushed his shoulder, and opened","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3731",5160,"his wounds anew, and all his blood began to flow from him.  But Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3732",5160,"drew his sword, and attacked the giant, and gave him a blow on the crown","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3733",5160,"of his head so severe, and fierce, and violent, that his head and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3734",5160,"neck were split down to his shoulders, and he fell dead.  So Geraint left","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3735",5160,"him thus, and returned to Enid.  And when he saw her, he fell down","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3736",5160,"lifeless from his horse.  Piercing, and loud, and thrilling was the cry","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3737",5160,"that Enid uttered.  And she came and stood over him where he had fallen.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3738",5160,"And at the sound of her cries came the Earl of Limours, and the host that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3739",5160,"journeyed with him, whom her lamentations brought out of their road.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3740",5160,"the Earl said to Enid, “Alas, Lady, what hath befallen thee?”  “Ah! good","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3741",5160,"Sir,” said she, “the only man I have loved, or ever shall love, is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3742",5160,"slain.”  Then he said to the other, “And what is the cause of thy grief?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3743",5160,"“They have slain my beloved husband also,” said she.  “And who was it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3744",5160,"that slew them?”  “Some giants,” she answered, “slew my best-beloved, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3745",5160,"the other knight went in pursuit of them, and came back in the state thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3746",5160,"seest, his blood flowing excessively; but it appears to me that he did","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3747",5160,"not leave the giants without killing some of them, if not all.”  The Earl","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3748",5160,"caused the knight that was dead to be buried, but he thought that there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3749",5160,"still remained some life in Geraint; and to see if he yet would live, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3750",5160,"had him carried with him in the hollow of his shield, and upon a bier.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3751",5160,"And the two damsels went to the Court; and when they arrived there,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3752",5160,"Geraint was placed upon a litter-couch in front of the table that was in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3753",5160,"the hall.  Then they all took off their travelling gear, and the Earl","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3754",5160,"besought Enid to do the same, and to clothe herself in other garments.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3755",5160,"“I will not, by Heaven,” said she.  “Ah! Lady,” said he, “be not so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3756",5160,"sorrowful for this matter.”  “It were hard to persuade me to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3757",5160,"otherwise,” said she.  “I will act towards thee in such wise, that thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3758",5160,"needest not be sorrowful, whether yonder knight live or die.  Behold, a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3759",5160,"good Earldom, together with myself, will I bestow on thee; be, therefore,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3760",5160,"happy and joyful.”  “I declare to Heaven,” said she, “that henceforth I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3761",5160,"shall never be joyful while I live.”  “Come, then,” said he, “and eat.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3762",5160,"“No, by Heaven, I will not,” she answered.  “But, by Heaven, thou shalt,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3763",5160,"said he.  So he took her with him to the table against her will, and many","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3764",5160,"times desired her to eat.  “I call Heaven to witness,” said she, “that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3765",5160,"will not eat until the man that is upon yonder bier shall eat likewise.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3766",5160,"“Thou canst not fulfil that,” said the Earl, “yonder man is dead","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3767",5160,"already.”  “I will prove that I can,” said she.  Then he offered her a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3768",5160,"goblet of liquor.  “Drink this goblet,” he said, “and it will cause thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3769",5160,"to change thy mind.”  “Evil betide me,” she answered, “if I drink aught","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3770",5160,"until he drink also.”  “Truly,” said the Earl, “it is of no more avail","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3771",5160,"for me to be gentle with thee than ungentle.”  And he gave her a box on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3772",5160,"the ear.  Thereupon she raised a loud and piercing shriek, and her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3773",5160,"lamentations were much greater than they had been before, for she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3774",5160,"considered in her mind that had Geraint been alive, he durst not have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3775",5160,"struck her thus.  But, behold, at the sound of her cry, Geraint revived","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3776",5160,"from his swoon, and he sat up on the bier, and finding his sword in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3777",5160,"hollow of his shield, he rushed to the place where the Earl was, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3778",5160,"struck him a fiercely-wounding, severely-venomous, and sternly-smiting","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3779",5160,"blow upon the crown of his head, so that he clove him in twain, until his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3780",5160,"sword was stayed by the table.  Then all left the board, and fled away.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3781",5160,"And this was not so much through fear of the living as through the dread","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3782",5160,"they felt at seeing the dead man rise up to slay them.  And Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3783",5160,"looked upon Enid, and he was grieved for two causes; one was, to see that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3784",5160,"Enid had lost her colour and her wonted aspect, and the other, to know","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3785",5160,"that she was in the right.  “Lady,” said he, “knowest thou where our","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3786",5160,"horses are?”  “I know, Lord, where thy horse is,” she replied, “but I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3787",5160,"know not where is the other.  Thy horse is in the house yonder.”  So he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3788",5160,"went to the house, and brought forth his horse, and mounted him, and took","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3789",5160,"up Enid from the ground, and placed her upon the horse with him.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3790",5160,"rode forward.  And their road lay between two hedges.  And the night was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3791",5160,"gaining on the day.  And lo! they saw behind them the shafts of spears","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3792",5160,"betwixt them and the sky, and they heard the trampling of horses, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3793",5160,"noise of a host approaching.  “I hear something following us,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3794",5160,"“and I will put thee on the other side of the hedge.”  And thus he did.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3795",5160,"And thereupon, behold, a knight pricked towards him, and couched his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3796",5160,"lance.  When Enid saw this, she cried out, saying, “Oh! chieftain,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3797",5160,"whoever thou art, what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3798",5160,"“Oh! Heaven,” said he, “is it Geraint?”  “Yes, in truth,” said she.  “And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3799",5160,"who art thou?”  “I am the Little King,” he answered, “coming to thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3800",5160,"assistance, for I heard that thou wast in trouble.  And if thou hadst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3801",5160,"followed my advice, none of these hardships would have befallen thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3802",5160,"“Nothing can happen,” said Geraint, “without the will of Heaven, though","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3803",5160,"much good results from counsel.”  “Yes,” said the Little King, “and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3804",5160,"know good counsel for thee now.  Come with me to the court of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3805",5160,"son-in-law of my sister, which is near here, and thou shalt have the best","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3806",5160,"medical assistance in the kingdom.”  “I will do so gladly,” said Geraint.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3807",5160,"And Enid was placed upon the horse of one of the Little King’s squires,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3808",5160,"and they went forward to the Baron’s palace.  And they were received","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3809",5160,"there with gladness, and they met with hospitality and attention.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3810",5160,"the next morning they went to seek physicians; and it was not long before","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3811",5160,"they came, and they attended Geraint until he was perfectly well.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3812",5160,"while Geraint was under medical care, the Little King caused his armour","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3813",5160,"to be repaired, until it was as good as it had ever been.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3814",5160,"remained there a fortnight and a month.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3815",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3816",5160,"Then the Little King said to Geraint, “Now will we go towards my own","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3817",5160,"Court, to take rest, and amuse ourselves.”  “Not so,” said Geraint, “we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3818",5160,"will first journey for one day more, and return again.”  “With all my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3819",5160,"heart,” said the Little King, “do thou go then.”  And early in the day","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3820",5160,"they set forth.  And more gladly and more joyfully did Enid journey with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3821",5160,"them that day than she had ever done.  And they came to the main road.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3822",5160,"And when they reached a place where the road divided in two, they beheld","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3823",5160,"a man on foot coming towards them along one of these roads, and Gwiffert","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3824",5160,"asked the man whence he came.  “I come,” said he, “from an errand in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3825",5160,"country.”  “Tell me,” said Geraint, “which is the best for me to follow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3826",5160,"of these two roads?”  “That is the best for thee to follow,” answered he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3827",5160,"“for if thou goest by this one, thou wilt never return.  Below us,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3828",5160,"he, “there is a hedge of mist, and within it are enchanted games, and no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3829",5160,"one who has gone there has ever returned.  And the Court of the Earl","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3830",5160,"Owain is there, and he permits no one to go to lodge in the town, except","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3831",5160,"he will go to his Court.”  “I declare to Heaven,” said Geraint, “that we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3832",5160,"will take the lower road.”  And they went along it until they came to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3833",5160,"town.  And they took the fairest and pleasantest place in the town for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3834",5160,"their lodging.  And while they were thus, behold, a young man came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3835",5160,"them, and greeted them.  “Heaven be propitious to thee,” said they.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3836",5160,"“Good Sirs,” said he, “what preparations are you making here?”  “We are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3837",5160,"taking up our lodging,” said they, “to pass the night.”  “It is not the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3838",5160,"custom with him who owns the town,” he answered, “to permit any of gentle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3839",5160,"birth, unless they come to stay in his Court, to abide here; therefore,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3840",5160,"come ye to the Court.”  “We will come, gladly,” said Geraint.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3841",5160,"went with the page, and they were joyfully received.  And the Earl came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3842",5160,"to the hall to meet them, and he commanded the tables to be laid.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3843",5160,"they washed, and sat down.  And this is the order in which they sat:","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3844",5160,"Geraint on one side of the Earl, and Enid on the other side, and next to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3845",5160,"Enid the Little King, and then the Countess next to Geraint; and all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3846",5160,"after that as became their rank.  Then Geraint recollected the games, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3847",5160,"thought that he should not go to them; and on that account he did not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3848",5160,"eat.  Then the Earl looked upon Geraint, and considered, and he bethought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3849",5160,"him that his not eating was because of the games, and it grieved him that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3850",5160,"he had ever established those games, were it only on account of losing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3851",5160,"such a youth as Geraint.  And if Geraint had asked him to abolish the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3852",5160,"games, he would gladly have done so.  Then the Earl said to Geraint,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3853",5160,"“What thought occupies thy mind, that thou dost not eat?  If thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3854",5160,"hesitatest about going to the games, thou shalt not go, and no other of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3855",5160,"thy rank shall ever go either.”  “Heaven reward thee,” said Geraint, “but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3856",5160,"I wish nothing better than to go to the games, and to be shown the way","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3857",5160,"thither.”  “If that is what thou dost prefer, thou shalt obtain it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3858",5160,"willingly.”  “I do prefer it, indeed,” said he.  Then they ate, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3859",5160,"were amply served, and they had a variety of gifts, and abundance of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3860",5160,"liquor.  And when they had finished eating they arose.  And Geraint","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3861",5160,"called for his horse and his armour, and he accoutred both himself and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3862",5160,"his horse.  And all the hosts went forth until they came to the side of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3863",5160,"the hedge, and the hedge was so lofty, that it reached as high as they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3864",5160,"could see in the air, and upon every stake in the hedge, except two,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3865",5160,"there was the head of a man, and the number of stakes throughout the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3866",5160,"hedge was very great.  Then said the Little King, “May no one go in with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3867",5160,"the chieftain?”  “No one may,” said Earl Owain.  “Which way can I enter?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3868",5160,"inquired Geraint.  “I know not,” said Owain, “but enter by the way that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3869",5160,"thou wilt, and that seemeth easiest to thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3870",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3871",5160,"Then fearlessly and unhesitatingly Geraint dashed forward into the mist.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3872",5160,"And on leaving the mist, he came to a large orchard; and in the orchard","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3873",5160,"he saw an open space, wherein was a tent of red satin; and the door of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3874",5160,"the tent was open, and an apple-tree stood in front of the door of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3875",5160,"tent; and on a branch of the apple-tree hung a huge hunting-horn.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3876",5160,"he dismounted, and went into the tent; and there was no one in the tent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3877",5160,"save one maiden sitting in a golden chair, and another chair was opposite","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3878",5160,"to her, empty.  And Geraint went to the empty chair, and sat down","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3879",5160,"therein.  “Ah! chieftain,” said the maiden, “I would not counsel thee to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3880",5160,"sit in that chair.”  “Wherefore?” said Geraint.  “The man to whom that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3881",5160,"chair belongs has never suffered another to sit in it.”  “I care not,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3882",5160,"said Geraint, “though it displease him that I sit in the chair.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3883",5160,"thereupon they heard a mighty tumult around the tent.  And Geraint looked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3884",5160,"to see what was the cause of the tumult.  And he beheld without a knight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3885",5160,"mounted upon a warhorse, proudly snorting, high-mettled, and large of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3886",5160,"bone; and a robe of honour in two parts was upon him and upon his horse,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3887",5160,"and beneath it was plenty of armour.  “Tell me, chieftain,” said he to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3888",5160,"Geraint, “who it was that bade thee sit there?”  “Myself,” answered he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3889",5160,"“It was wrong of thee to do me this shame and disgrace.  Arise, and do me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3890",5160,"satisfaction for thine insolence.”  Then Geraint arose; and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3891",5160,"encountered immediately; and they broke a set of lances, and a second","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3892",5160,"set, and a third; and they gave each other fierce and frequent strokes;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3893",5160,"and at last Geraint became enraged, and he urged on his horse, and rushed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3894",5160,"upon him, and gave him a thrust on the centre of his shield, so that it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3895",5160,"was split, and so that the head of his lance went through his armour, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3896",5160,"his girths were broken, and he himself was borne headlong to the ground","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3897",5160,"the length of Geraint’s lance and arm, over his horse’s crupper.  “Oh, my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3898",5160,"Lord!” said he, “thy mercy, and thou shalt have what thou wilt.”  “I only","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3899",5160,"desire,” said Geraint, “that this game shall no longer exist here, nor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3900",5160,"the hedge of mist, nor magic, nor enchantment.”  “Thou shalt have this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3901",5160,"gladly, Lord,” he replied.  “Cause, then, the mist to disappear from this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3902",5160,"place,” said Geraint.  “Sound yonder horn,” said he, “and when thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3903",5160,"soundest it, the mist will vanish; but it will not go hence unless the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3904",5160,"horn be blown by the knight by whom I am vanquished.”  And sad and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3905",5160,"sorrowful was Enid where she remained, through anxiety concerning","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3906",5160,"Geraint.  Then Geraint went and sounded the horn.  And at the first blast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3907",5160,"he gave, the mist vanished.  And all the hosts came together, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3908",5160,"all became reconciled to each other.  And the Earl invited Geraint and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3909",5160,"the Little King to stay with him that night.  And the next morning they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3910",5160,"separated.  And Geraint went towards his own dominions; and thenceforth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3911",5160,"he reigned prosperously, and his warlike fame and splendour lasted with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3924",5160,"after their union, the people put up prayers that they might have an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3926",5160,"time of her pregnancy Goleuddydd became wild, and wandered about, without","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3927",5160,"habitation; but when her delivery was at hand, her reason came back to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3928",5160,"her.  Then she went to a mountain where there was a swineherd, keeping a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3929",5160,"herd of swine.  And through fear of the swine the queen was delivered.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3930",5160,"And the swineherd took the boy, and brought him to the palace; and he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3932",5160,"swine’s burrow.  Nevertheless the boy was of gentle lineage, and cousin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3937",5160,"this sickness I shall die, and thou wilt take another wife.  Now wives","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3938",5160,"are the gift of the Lord, but it would be wrong for thee to harm thy son.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3939",5160,"Therefore I charge thee that thou take not a wife until thou see a briar","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3941",5160,"besought him to dress her grave every year, that nothing might grow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3949",5160,"the king saw the briar.  And when he saw it, the king took counsel where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3958",5160,"the queen said to her, “Old woman, tell me that which I shall ask thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3968",5160,"no longer.”  And he sent messengers for his son, and he was brought to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3969",5160,"the Court.  His stepmother said unto him, “It were well for thee to have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3973",5160,"with a wife until thou obtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3974",5160,"And the youth blushed, and the love of the maiden diffused itself through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3976",5160,"of him, “What has come over thee, my son, and what aileth thee?”  “My","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3979",5160,"for thee,” answered his father.  “Arthur is thy cousin.  Go, therefore,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"3990",5160,"bearing a cross of inlaid gold of the hue of the lightning of heaven: his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3991",5160,"war-horn was of ivory.  Before him were two brindled white-breasted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3992",5160,"greyhounds, having strong collars of rubies about their necks, reaching","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3993",5160,"from the shoulder to the ear.  And the one that was on the left side","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3994",5160,"bounded across to the right side, and the one on the right to the left,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3995",5160,"and like two sea-swallows sported around him.  And his courser cast up","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3996",5160,"four sods with his four hoofs, like four swallows in the air, about his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3997",5160,"head, now above, now below.  About him was a four-cornered cloth of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3998",5160,"purple, and an apple of gold was at each corner, and every one of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"3999",5160,"apples was of the value of an hundred kine.  And there was precious gold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4296",5160,"nine nights and nine days under water, and he could exist nine nights and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4297",5160,"nine days without sleep.  A wound from Kai’s sword no physician could","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4298",5160,"heal.  Very subtle was Kai.  When it pleased him he could render himself","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4301",5160,"hardest, whatever he carried remained dry for a handbreadth above and a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4308",5160,"three warriors could not shed blood faster than he on the field of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4319",5160,"without achieving the adventure of which he went in quest.  He was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4320",5160,"best of footmen and the best of knights.  He was nephew to Arthur, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4322",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4324",5160,"into a savage country, he might cast a charm and an illusion over them,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4325",5160,"so that none might see them whilst they could see every one.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4326",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4327",5160,"They journeyed until they came to a vast open plain, wherein they saw a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4328",5160,"great castle, which was the fairest of the castles of the world.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4329",5160,"they journeyed that day until the evening, and when they thought they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4330",5160,"were nigh to the castle, they were no nearer to it than they had been in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4331",5160,"the morning.  And the second and the third day they journeyed, and even","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4332",5160,"then scarcely could they reach so far.  And when they came before the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4333",5160,"castle, they beheld a vast flock of sheep, which was boundless and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4334",5160,"without an end.  And upon the top of a mound there was a herdsman,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4335",5160,"keeping the sheep.  And a rug made of skins was upon him; and by his side","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4336",5160,"was a shaggy mastiff, larger than a steed nine winters old.  Never had he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4337",5160,"lost even a lamb from his flock, much less a large sheep.  He let no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4338",5160,"occasion ever pass without doing some hurt and harm.  All the dead trees","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4339",5160,"and bushes in the plain he burnt with his breath down to the very ground.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4340",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4341",5160,"Then said Kai, “Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, go thou and salute yonder","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4342",5160,"man.”  “Kai,” said he, “I engaged not to go further than thou thyself.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4343",5160,"“Let us go then together,” answered Kai.  Said Menw the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4344",5160,"Teirgwaedd, “Fear not to go thither, for I will cast a spell upon the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4345",5160,"dog, so that he shall injure no one.”  And they went up to the mound","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4346",5160,"whereon the herdsman was, and they said to him, “How dost thou fare, O","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4347",5160,"herdsman?”  “No less fair be it to you than to me.”  “Truly, art thou the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4348",5160,"chief?”  “There is no hurt to injure me but my own.” {5}  “Whose are the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4349",5160,"sheep that thou dost keep, and to whom does yonder castle belong?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4350",5160,"“Stupid are ye, truly!  Through the whole world is it known that this is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4351",5160,"the castle of Yspaddaden Penkawr.”  “And who art thou?”  “I am called","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4352",5160,"Custennin the son of Dyfnedig, and my brother Yspaddaden Penkawr","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4353",5160,"oppressed me because of my possessions.  And ye also, who are ye?”  “We","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4354",5160,"are an embassy from Arthur, come to seek Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4355",5160,"Penkawr.”  “Oh men! the mercy of Heaven be upon you, do not that for all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4356",5160,"the world.  None who ever came hither on this quest has returned alive.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4357",5160,"And the herdsman rose up.  And as he arose, Kilhwch gave unto him a ring","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4358",5160,"of gold.  And he sought to put on the ring, but it was too small for him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4359",5160,"so he placed it in the finger of his glove.  And he went home, and gave","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4360",5160,"the glove to his spouse to keep.  And she took the ring from the glove","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4361",5160,"when it was given her, and she said, “Whence came this ring, for thou art","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4362",5160,"not wont to have good fortune?”  “I went,” said he, “to the sea to seek","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4363",5160,"for fish, and lo, I saw a corpse borne by the waves.  And a fairer corpse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4364",5160,"than it did I never behold.  And from its finger did I take this ring.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4365",5160,"“O man! does the sea permit its dead to wear jewels?  Show me then this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4366",5160,"body.”  “Oh wife, him to whom this ring belonged thou shalt see here in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4367",5160,"the evening.”  “And who is he?” asked the woman, “Kilhwch the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4368",5160,"Kilydd, the son of Prince Kelyddon, by Goleuddydd the daughter of Prince","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4369",5160,"Anlawdd, his mother, who is come to seek Olwen as his wife.”  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4370",5160,"she heard that, her feelings were divided between the joy that she had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4371",5160,"that her nephew, the son of her sister, was coming to her, and sorrow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4372",5160,"because she had never known any one depart alive who had come on that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4373",5160,"quest.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4374",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4375",5160,"And they went forward to the gate of Custennin the herdsman’s dwelling.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4376",5160,"And when she heard their footsteps approaching, she ran out with joy to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4377",5160,"meet them.  And Kai snatched a billet out of the pile.  And when she met","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4378",5160,"them she sought to throw her arms about their necks.  And Kai placed the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4379",5160,"log between her two hands, and she squeezed it so that it became a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4380",5160,"twisted coil.  “Oh woman,” said Kai, “if thou hadst squeezed me thus,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4381",5160,"none could ever again have set their affections on me.  Evil love were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4382",5160,"this.”  They entered into the house, and were served; and soon after they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4383",5160,"all went forth to amuse themselves.  Then the woman opened a stone chest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4384",5160,"that was before the chimney-corner, and out of it arose a youth with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4385",5160,"yellow curling hair.  Said Gwrhyr, “It is a pity to hide this youth.  I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4386",5160,"know that it is not his own crime that is thus visited upon him.”  “This","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4387",5160,"is but a remnant,” said the woman.  “Three-and-twenty of my sons has","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4388",5160,"Yspaddaden Penkawr slain, and I have no more hope of this one than of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4389",5160,"others.”  Then said Kai, “Let him come and be a companion with me, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4390",5160,"shall not be slain unless I also am slain with him.”  And they ate.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4391",5160,"the woman asked them, “Upon what errand come you here?”  “We come to seek","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4392",5160,"Olwen for this youth.”  Then said the woman, “In the name of Heaven,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4393",5160,"since no one from the castle hath yet seen you, return again whence you","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4394",5160,"came.”  “Heaven is our witness, that we will not return until we have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4395",5160,"seen the maiden.”  Said Kai, “Does she ever come hither, so that she may","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4396",5160,"be seen?”  “She comes here every Saturday to wash her head, and in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4397",5160,"vessel where she washes, she leaves all her rings, and she never either","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4398",5160,"comes herself or sends any messengers to fetch them.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4399",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4400",5160,"“Will she come here if she is sent to?”  “Heaven knows that I will not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4401",5160,"destroy my soul, nor will I betray those that trust me; unless you will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4402",5160,"pledge me your faith that you will not harm her, I will not send to her.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4403",5160,"“We pledge it,” said they.  So a message was sent, and she came.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4404",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4405",5160,"The maiden was clothed in a robe of flame-coloured silk, and about her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4406",5160,"neck was a collar of ruddy gold, on which were precious emeralds and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4407",5160,"rubies.  More yellow was her head than the flower of the broom, and her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4408",5160,"skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4409",5160,"her fingers than the blossoms of the wood anemone amidst the spray of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4410",5160,"meadow fountain.  The eye of the trained hawk, the glance of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4411",5160,"three-mewed falcon was not brighter than hers.  Her bosom was more snowy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4412",5160,"than the breast of the white swan, her cheek was redder than the reddest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4413",5160,"roses.  Whoso beheld her was filled with her love.  Four white trefoils","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4414",5160,"sprung up wherever she trod.  And therefore was she called Olwen.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4415",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4416",5160,"She entered the house, and sat beside Kilhwch upon the foremost bench;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4418",5160,"maiden, thou art she whom I have loved; come away with me, lest they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4419",5160,"speak evil of thee and of me.  Many a day have I loved thee.”  “I cannot","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4420",5160,"do this, for I have pledged my faith to my father not to go without his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4421",5160,"counsel, for his life will last only until the time of my espousals.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4422",5160,"Whatever is, must be.  But I will give thee advice if thou wilt take it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4423",5160,"Go, ask me of my father, and that which he shall require of thee, grant","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4856",5160,"And Gwrnach said to him, “Oh man! is it true that is reported of thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4857",5160,"that thou knowest how to burnish swords?”  “I know full well how to do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4858",5160,"so,” answered Kai.  Then was the sword of Gwrnach brought to him.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4859",5160,"Kai took a blue whetstone from under his arm, and asked him whether he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4860",5160,"would have it burnished white or blue.  “Do with it as it seems good to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4861",5160,"thee, and as thou wouldest if it were thine own.”  Then Kai polished one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4862",5160,"half of the blade and put it in his hand.  “Will this please thee?” asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4863",5160,"he.  “I would rather than all that is in my dominions that the whole of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4864",5160,"it were like unto this.  It is a marvel to me that such a man as thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4865",5160,"should be without a companion.”  “Oh! noble sir, I have a companion,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4866",5160,"albeit he is not skilled in this art.”  “Who may he be?”  “Let the porter","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4867",5160,"go forth, and I will tell him whereby he may know him.  The head of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4868",5160,"lance will leave its shaft, and draw blood from the wind, and will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4869",5160,"descend upon its shaft again.”  Then the gate was opened, and Bedwyr","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4870",5160,"entered.  And Kai said, “Bedwyr is very skilful, although he knows not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4871",5160,"this art.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4872",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4873",5160,"And there was much discourse among those who were without, because that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4874",5160,"Kai and Bedwyr had gone in.  And a young man who was with them, the only","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4875",5160,"son of Custennin the herdsman, got in also.  And he caused all his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4876",5160,"companions to keep close to him as he passed the three wards, and until","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4877",5160,"he came into the midst of the castle.  And his companions said unto the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4878",5160,"son of Custennin, “Thou hast done this!  Thou art the best of all men.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4879",5160,"And thenceforth he was called Goreu, the son of Custennin.  Then they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4880",5160,"dispersed to their lodgings, that they might slay those who lodged","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4881",5160,"therein, unknown to the Giant.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4882",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4883",5160,"The sword was now polished, and Kai gave it unto the hand of Gwrnach the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4884",5160,"Giant, to see if he were pleased with his work.  And the Giant said, “The","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4885",5160,"work is good, I am content therewith.”  Said Kai, “It is thy scabbard","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4886",5160,"that hath rusted thy sword, give it to me that I may take out the wooden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4887",5160,"sides of it and put in new ones.”  And he took the scabbard from him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4888",5160,"the sword in the other hand.  And he came and stood over against the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4889",5160,"Giant, as if he would have put the sword into the scabbard; and with it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4890",5160,"he struck at the head of the Giant, and cut off his head at one blow.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4891",5160,"Then they despoiled the castle, and took from it what goods and jewels","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4892",5160,"they would.  And again on the same day, at the beginning of the year,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4893",5160,"they came to Arthur’s Court, bearing with them the sword of Gwrnach the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4894",5160,"Giant.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4895",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4896",5160,"Now, when they told Arthur how they had sped, Arthur said, “Which of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4897",5160,"these marvels will it be best for us to seek first?”  “It will be best,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4898",5160,"said they, “to seek Mabon the son of Modron; and he will not be found","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4899",5160,"unless we first find Eidoel the son of Aer, his kinsman.”  Then Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4900",5160,"rose up, and the warriors of the Islands of Britain with him, to seek for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4901",5160,"Eidoel; and they proceeded until they came before the Castle of Glivi,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4902",5160,"where Eidoel was imprisoned.  Glivi stood on the summit of his castle,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4903",5160,"and he said, “Arthur, what requirest thou of me, since nothing remains to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4904",5160,"me in this fortress, and I have neither joy nor pleasure in it; neither","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4905",5160,"wheat nor oats?  Seek not therefore to do me harm.”  Said Arthur, “Not to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4906",5160,"injure thee came I hither, but to seek for the prisoner that is with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4907",5160,"thee.”  “I will give thee my prisoner, though I had not thought to give","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4908",5160,"him up to any one; and therewith shalt thou have my support and my aid.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4909",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4910",5160,"His followers said unto Arthur, “Lord, go thou home, thou canst not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4911",5160,"proceed with thy host in quest of such small adventures as these.”  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4912",5160,"said Arthur, “It were well for thee, Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, to go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4913",5160,"upon this quest, for thou knowest all languages, and art familiar with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4914",5160,"those of the birds and the beasts.  Thou, Eidoel, oughtest likewise to go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4915",5160,"with my men in search of thy cousin.  And as for you, Kai and Bedwyr, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4916",5160,"have hope of whatever adventure ye are in quest of, that ye will achieve","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4917",5160,"it.  Achieve ye this adventure for me.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4918",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4919",5160,"They went forward until they came to the Ousel of Cilgwri.  And Gwrhyr","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4920",5160,"adjured her for the sake of Heaven, saying, “Tell me if thou knowest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4921",5160,"aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken when three nights old","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4922",5160,"from between his mother and the wall.”  And the Ousel answered, “When I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4923",5160,"first came here, there was a smith’s anvil in this place, and I was then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4924",5160,"a young bird; and from that time no work has been done upon it, save the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4925",5160,"pecking of my beak every evening, and now there is not so much as the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4926",5160,"size of a nut remaining thereof; yet the vengeance of Heaven be upon me,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4927",5160,"if during all that time I have ever heard of the man for whom you","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4928",5160,"inquire.  Nevertheless I will do that which is right, and that which it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4929",5160,"is fitting that I should do for an embassy from Arthur.  There is a race","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4930",5160,"of animals who were formed before me, and I will be your guide to them.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4931",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4932",5160,"So they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of Redynvre.  “Stag of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4933",5160,"Redynvre, behold we are come to thee, an embassy from Arthur, for we have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4934",5160,"not heard of any animal older than thou.  Say, knowest thou aught of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4935",5160,"Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken from his mother when three nights","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4936",5160,"old?”  The Stag said, “When first I came hither, there was a plain all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4937",5160,"around me, without any trees save one oak sapling, which grew up to be an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4938",5160,"oak with an hundred branches.  And that oak has since perished, so that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4939",5160,"now nothing remains of it but the withered stump; and from that day to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4940",5160,"this I have been here, yet have I never heard of the man for whom you","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4941",5160,"inquire.  Nevertheless, being an embassy from Arthur, I will be your","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4942",5160,"guide to the place where there is an animal which was formed before I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4943",5160,"was.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4944",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4945",5160,"So they proceeded to the place where was the Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd.  “Owl of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4946",5160,"Cwm Cawlwyd, here is an embassy from Arthur; knowest thou aught of Mabon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4947",5160,"the son of Modron, who was taken after three nights from his mother?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4948",5160,"“If I knew I would tell you.  When first I came hither, the wide valley","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4949",5160,"you see was a wooded glen.  And a race of men came and rooted it up.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4950",5160,"there grew there a second wood; and this wood is the third.  My wings,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4951",5160,"are they not withered stumps?  Yet all this time, even until to-day, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4952",5160,"have never heard of the man for whom you inquire.  Nevertheless, I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4953",5160,"be the guide of Arthur’s embassy until you come to the place where is the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4954",5160,"oldest animal in this world, and the one that has travelled most, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4955",5160,"Eagle of Gwern Abwy.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4956",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4957",5160,"Gwrhyr said, “Eagle of Gwern Abwy, we have come to thee an embassy from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4958",5160,"Arthur, to ask thee if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4959",5160,"was taken from his mother when he was three nights old.”  The Eagle said,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4960",5160,"“I have been here for a great space of time, and when I first came hither","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4961",5160,"there was a rock here, from the top of which I pecked at the stars every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4962",5160,"evening; and now it is not so much as a span high.  From that day to this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4963",5160,"I have been here, and I have never heard of the man for whom you inquire,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4964",5160,"except once when I went in search of food as far as Llyn Llyw.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4965",5160,"I came there, I struck my talons into a salmon, thinking he would serve","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4966",5160,"me as food for a long time.  But he drew me into the deep, and I was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4967",5160,"scarcely able to escape from him.  After that I went with my whole","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4968",5160,"kindred to attack him, and to try to destroy him, but he sent messengers,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4969",5160,"and made peace with me; and came and besought me to take fifty fish","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4970",5160,"spears out of his back.  Unless he know something of him whom you seek, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4971",5160,"cannot tell who may.  However, I will guide you to the place where he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4972",5160,"is.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4973",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4974",5160,"So they went thither; and the Eagle said, “Salmon of Llyn Llyw, I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4975",5160,"come to thee with an embassy from Arthur, to ask thee if thou knowest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4976",5160,"aught concerning Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken away at three","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4977",5160,"nights old from his mother.”  “As much as I know I will tell thee.  With","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4978",5160,"every tide I go along the river upwards, until I come near to the walls","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4979",5160,"of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as I never found","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4980",5160,"elsewhere; and to the end that ye may give credence thereto, let one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4981",5160,"you go thither upon each of my two shoulders.”  So Kai and Gwrhyr","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4982",5160,"Gwalstawt Ieithoedd went upon the two shoulders of the salmon, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4983",5160,"proceeded until they came unto the wall of the prison, and they heard a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4984",5160,"great wailing and lamenting from the dungeon.  Said Gwrhyr, “Who is it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4985",5160,"that laments in this house of stone?”  “Alas, there is reason enough for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4986",5160,"whoever is here to lament.  It is Mabon the son of Modron who is here","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4987",5160,"imprisoned; and no imprisonment was ever so grievous as mine, neither","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4988",5160,"that of Llud Llaw Ereint, nor that of Greid the son of Eri.”  “Hast thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4989",5160,"hope of being released for gold or for silver, or for any gifts of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4990",5160,"wealth, or through battle and fighting?”  “By fighting will whatever I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"4992",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4993",5160,"Then they went thence, and returned to Arthur, and they told him where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4994",5160,"Mabon the son of Modron was imprisoned.  And Arthur summoned the warriors","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4995",5160,"of the Island, and they journeyed as far as Gloucester, to the place","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4996",5160,"where Mabon was in prison.  Kai and Bedwyr went upon the shoulders of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4997",5160,"fish, whilst the warriors of Arthur attacked the castle.  And Kai broke","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4998",5160,"through the wall into the dungeon, and brought away the prisoner upon his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"4999",5160,"back, whilst the fight was going on between the warriors.  And Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5006",5160,"it known,” asked Arthur, “where she is?”  “She is in Aber Deu Cleddyf,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5007",5160,"said one.  Then Arthur went to the house of Tringad, in Aber Cleddyf, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5008",5160,"he inquired of him whether he had heard of her there.  “In what form may","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5015",5160,"change them again for Arthur into their own form.  And the host of Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5049",5160,"Kai knew certainly that he was asleep, he made a pit under his feet, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5050",5160,"largest in the world, and he struck him a violent blow, and squeezed him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5051",5160,"into the pit.  And there they twitched out his beard completely with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5052",5160,"wooden tweezers; and after that they slew him altogether.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5053",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5054",5160,"And from thence they both went to Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, and took the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5110",5160,"to see if the precious things were between the two ears of Twrch Trwyth,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5115",5160,"upon the top of his lair, and strove to snatch away one of the precious","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5117",5160,"And the boar rose up angrily and shook himself so that some of his venom","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5125",5160,"denial.  And Arthur set forward with a small retinue, and entered into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5126",5160,"Prydwen, his ship, and went over to Ireland.  And they proceeded into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5128",5160,"When they had eaten and drunk as much as they desired, Arthur demanded to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5134",5160,"was brother, by the mother’s side, to Arthur’s servant, Cachamwri.  His","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5135",5160,"office was always to carry Arthur’s cauldron, and to place fire under it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5136",5160,"And Llenlleawg Wyddel seized Caledvwlch, and brandished it.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5138",5160,"with them.  And when he had put them to flight, Arthur with his men went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5139",5160,"forward to the ship, carrying away the cauldron full of Irish money.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5140",5160,"he disembarked at the house of Llwydden the son of Kelcoed, at Porth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5142",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5143",5160,"Then Arthur summoned unto him all the warriors that were in the three","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5145",5160,"in France and in Armorica, in Normandy and in the Summer Country, and all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5146",5160,"that were chosen footmen and valiant horsemen.  And with all these he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5147",5160,"went into Ireland.  And in Ireland there was great fear and terror","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5148",5160,"concerning him.  And when Arthur had landed in the country, there came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5149",5160,"unto him the saints of Ireland and besought his protection.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5150",5160,"granted his protection unto them, and they gave him their blessing.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5151",5160,"the men of Ireland came unto Arthur, and brought him provisions.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5152",5160,"Arthur went as far as Esgeir Oervel in Ireland, to the place where the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5153",5160,"Boar Trwyth was with his seven young pigs.  And the dogs were let loose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5154",5160,"upon him from all sides.  That day until evening the Irish fought with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5155",5160,"him, nevertheless he laid waste the fifth part of Ireland.  And on the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5156",5160,"day following the household of Arthur fought with him, and they were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5157",5160,"worsted by him, and got no advantage.  And the third day Arthur himself","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5158",5160,"encountered him, and he fought with him nine nights and nine days without","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5159",5160,"so much as killing even one little pig.  The warriors inquired of Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5160",5160,"what was the origin of that swine; and he told them that he was once a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5161",5160,"king, and that God had transformed him into a swine for his sins.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5162",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5163",5160,"Then Arthur sent Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, to endeavour to speak with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5166",5160,"Ieithoedd asked him, “By him who turned you into this form, if you can","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5167",5160,"speak, let some one of you, I beseech you, come and talk with Arthur.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5168",5160,"Grugyn Gwrych Ereint made answer to him.  (Now his bristles were like","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5169",5160,"silver wire, and whether he went through the wood or through the plain,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5170",5160,"he was to be traced by the glittering of his bristles.)  And this was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5171",5160,"answer that Grugyn made: “By him who turned us into this form, we will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5172",5160,"not do so, and we will not speak with Arthur.  That we have been","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5173",5160,"transformed thus is enough for us to suffer, without your coming here to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5174",5160,"fight with us.”  “I will tell you.  Arthur comes but to fight for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5175",5160,"comb, and the razor, and the scissors which are between the two ears of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5176",5160,"Twrch Trwyth.”  Said Grugyn, “Except he first take his life, he will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5177",5160,"never have those precious things.  And to-morrow morning we will rise up","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5178",5160,"hence, and we will go into Arthur’s country, and there will we do all the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5180",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5181",5160,"So they set forth through the sea towards Wales.  And Arthur and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5182",5160,"hosts, and his horses and his dogs, entered Prydwen, that they might","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5183",5160,"encounter them without delay.  Twrch Trwyth landed in Porth Cleis in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5184",5160,"Dyved, and Arthur came to Mynyw.  The next day it was told to Arthur that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5202",5160,"made a second stand in the same place.  And there he slew Gwydre the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5206",5160,"And the next morning before it was day, some of the men came up with him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5243",5160,"Din Tywi.  And thence he proceeded to Ceredigiawn, and Eli and Trachmyr","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5244",5160,"with him, and a multitude likewise.  Then he came to Garth Gregyn, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5245",5160,"there Llwydawg Govynnyad fought in the midst of them, and slew Rhudvyw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5246",5160,"Rhys and many others with him.  Then Llwydawg went thence to Ystrad Yw,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5247",5160,"and there the men of Armorica met him, and there he slew Hirpeissawg the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5248",5160,"king of Armorica, and Llygatrudd Emys, and Gwrbothu, Arthur’s uncles, his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5249",5160,"mother’s brothers, and there was he himself slain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5250",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5251",5160,"Twrch Trwyth went from there to between Tawy and Euyas, and Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5252",5160,"summoned all Cornwall and Devon unto him, to the estuary of the Severn,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5253",5160,"and he said to the warriors of this Island, “Twrch Trwyth has slain many","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5254",5160,"of my men, but, by the valour of warriors, while I live he shall not go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5255",5160,"into Cornwall.  And I will not follow him any longer, but I will oppose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5256",5160,"him life to life.  Do ye as ye will.”  And he resolved that he would send","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5257",5160,"a body of knights, with the dogs of the Island, as far as Euyas, who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5258",5160,"should return thence to the Severn, and that tried warriors should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5259",5160,"traverse the Island, and force him into the Severn.  And Mabon the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5260",5160,"Modron came up with him at the Severn, upon Gwynn Mygdwn, the horse of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5261",5160,"Gweddw, and Goreu the son of Custennin, and Menw the son of Teirgwaedd;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5262",5160,"this was betwixt Llyn Lliwan and Aber Gwy.  And Arthur fell upon him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5263",5160,"together with the champions of Britain.  And Osla Kyllellvawr drew near,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5264",5160,"and Manawyddan the son of Llyr, and Kacmwri the servant of Arthur, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5265",5160,"Gwyngelli, and they seized hold of him, catching him first by his feet,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5266",5160,"and plunged him in the Severn, so that it overwhelmed him.  On the one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5267",5160,"side, Mabon the son of Modron spurred his steed and snatched his razor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5268",5160,"from him, and Kyledyr Wyllt came up with him on the other side, upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5269",5160,"another steed, in the Severn, and took from him the scissors.  But before","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5270",5160,"they could obtain the comb, he had regained the ground with his feet, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5271",5160,"from the moment that he reached the shore, neither dog, nor man, nor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5272",5160,"horse could overtake him until he came to Cornwall.  If they had had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5273",5160,"trouble in getting the jewels from him, much more had they in seeking to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5274",5160,"save the two men from being drowned.  Kacmwri, as they drew him forth,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5275",5160,"was dragged by two millstones into the deep.  And as Osla Kyllellvawr was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5276",5160,"running after the boar, his knife had dropped out of the sheath, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5277",5160,"had lost it, and after that, the sheath became full of water, and its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5278",5160,"weight drew him down into the deep, as they were drawing him forth.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5279",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5280",5160,"Then Arthur and his hosts proceeded until they overtook the boar in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5281",5160,"Cornwall, and the trouble which they had met with before was mere play to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5282",5160,"what they encountered in seeking the comb.  But from one difficulty to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5283",5160,"another, the comb was at length obtained.  And then he was hunted from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5284",5160,"Cornwall, and driven straight forward into the deep sea.  And thenceforth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5285",5160,"it was never known whither he went; and Aned and Aethlem with him.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5286",5160,"went Arthur to Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, to anoint himself, and to rest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5287",5160,"from his fatigues.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5288",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5289",5160,"Said Arthur, “Is there any one of the marvels yet unobtained?”  Said one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5290",5160,"of his men, “There is—the blood of the witch Orddu, the daughter of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5291",5160,"witch Orwen, of Pen Nant Govid, on the confines of Hell.”  Arthur set","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5292",5160,"forth towards the North, and came to the place where was the witch’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5293",5160,"cave.  And Gwyn ab Nudd, and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl, counselled him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5294",5160,"to send Kacmwri, and Hygwyd his brother, to fight with the witch.  And as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5295",5160,"they entered the cave, the witch seized upon them, and she caught Hygwyd","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5296",5160,"by the hair of his head, and threw him on the floor beneath her.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5297",5160,"Kacmwri caught her by the hair of her head, and dragged her to the earth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5298",5160,"from off Hygwyd, but she turned again upon them both, and drove them both","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5299",5160,"out with kicks and with cuffs.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5300",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5301",5160,"And Arthur was wroth at seeing his two attendants almost slain, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5302",5160,"sought to enter the cave; but Gwyn and Gwythyr said unto him, “It would","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5303",5160,"not be fitting or seemly for us to see thee squabbling with a hag.  Let","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5304",5160,"Hiramreu and Hireidil go to the cave.”  So they went.  But if great was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5305",5160,"the trouble of the first two that went, much greater was that of these","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5306",5160,"two.  And Heaven knows that not one of the four could move from the spot,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5307",5160,"until they placed them all upon Llamrei, Arthur’s mare.  And then Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5308",5160,"rushed to the door of the cave, and at the door he struck at the witch,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5309",5160,"with Carnwennan his dagger, and clove her in twain, so that she fell in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5310",5160,"two parts.  And Kaw, of North Britain, took the blood of the witch and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5311",5160,"kept it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5312",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5313",5160,"Then Kilhwch set forward, and Goreu the son of Custennin with him, and as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5314",5160,"many as wished ill to Yspaddaden Penkawr.  And they took the marvels with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5315",5160,"them to his court.  And Kaw of North Britain came and shaved his beard,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5316",5160,"skin, and flesh clean off to the very bone from ear to ear.  “Art thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5317",5160,"shaved, man?” said Kilhwch.  “I am shaved,” answered he.  “Is thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5318",5160,"daughter mine now?”  “She is thine,” said he, “but therefore needest thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5319",5160,"not thank me, but Arthur who hath accomplished this for thee.  By my free","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5320",5160,"will thou shouldest never have had her, for with her I lose my life.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5321",5160,"Then Goreu the son of Custennin seized him by the hair of his head, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5322",5160,"dragged him after him to the keep, and cut off his head and placed it on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5323",5160,"a stake on the citadel.  Then they took possession of his castle, and of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5325",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5328",5160,"each man to his own country.  And thus did Kilhwch obtain Olwen, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5340",5160,"Iorwerth had great sorrow and heaviness because of the honour and power","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5341",5160,"that his brother enjoyed, which he shared not.  And he sought his fellows","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5342",5160,"and his foster-brothers, and took counsel with them what he should do in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5343",5160,"this matter.  And they resolved to dispatch some of their number to go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5344",5160,"and seek a maintenance for him.  Then Madawc offered him to become Master","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5346",5160,"like as himself.  But Iorwerth refused this.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5347",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5348",5160,"And Iorwerth made an inroad into Loegria, slaying the inhabitants, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5349",5160,"burning houses, and carrying away prisoners.  And Madawc took counsel","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5350",5160,"with the men of Powys, and they determined to place an hundred men in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5351",5160,"each of the three Commots of Powys to seek for him.  And thus did they in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5352",5160,"the plains of Powys from Aber Ceirawc, and in Allictwn Ver, and in Rhyd","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5353",5160,"Wilure, on the Vyrnwy, the three best Commots of Powys.  So he was none","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5354",5160,"the better, he nor his household, in Powys, nor in the plains thereof.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5355",5160,"And they spread these men over the plains as far as Nillystwn Trevan.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5360",5160,"son of Cadwgan the son of Iddon.  And when they came near to the house,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5361",5160,"they saw an old hall, very black and having an upright gable, whence","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5362",5160,"issued a great smoke; and on entering, they found the floor full of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5363",5160,"puddles and mounds; and it was difficult to stand thereon, so slippery","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5364",5160,"was it with the mire of cattle.  And where the puddles were, a man might","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5365",5160,"go up to his ankles in water and dirt.  And there were boughs of holly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5366",5160,"spread over the floor, whereof the cattle had browsed the sprigs.  When","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5367",5160,"they came to the hall of the house, they beheld cells full of dust, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5368",5160,"very gloomy, and on one side an old hag making a fire.  And whenever she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5369",5160,"felt cold, she cast a lapful of chaff upon the fire, and raised such a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5370",5160,"smoke, that it was scarcely to be borne, as it rose up the nostrils.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5371",5160,"on the other side was a yellow calf-skin on the floor; a main privilege","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5372",5160,"was it to any one who should get upon that hide.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5373",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5374",5160,"And when they had sat down, they asked the hag where were the people of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5375",5160,"the house.  And the hag spoke not, but muttered.  Thereupon behold the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5376",5160,"people of the house entered; a ruddy, clownish, curly-headed man, with a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5377",5160,"burthen of faggots on his back, and a pale slender woman, also carrying a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5378",5160,"bundle under her arm.  And they barely welcomed the men, and kindled a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5379",5160,"fire with the boughs.  And the woman cooked something, and gave them to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5380",5160,"eat, barley bread, and cheese, and milk and water.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5381",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5382",5160,"And there arose a storm of wind and rain, so that it was hardly possible","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5383",5160,"to go forth with safety.  And being weary with their journey, they laid","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5384",5160,"themselves down and sought to sleep.  And when they looked at the couch,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5385",5160,"it seemed to be made but of a little coarse straw full of dust and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5386",5160,"vermin, with the stems of boughs sticking up there-through, for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5387",5160,"cattle had eaten all the straw that was placed at the head and the foot.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5388",5160,"And upon it was stretched an old russet-coloured rug, threadbare and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5389",5160,"ragged; and a coarse sheet, full of slits, was upon the rug, and an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5390",5160,"ill-stuffed pillow, and a worn-out cover upon the sheet.  And after much","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5391",5160,"suffering from the vermin, and from the discomfort of their couch, a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5392",5160,"heavy sleep fell on Rhonabwy’s companions.  But Rhonabwy, not being able","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5393",5160,"either to sleep or to rest, thought he should suffer less if he went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5394",5160,"lie upon the yellow calf-skin that was stretched out on the floor.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5399",5160,"thought that he went towards Rhyd y Groes on the Severn.  As he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5400",5160,"journeyed, he heard a mighty noise, the like whereof heard he never","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5401",5160,"before; and looking behind him, he beheld a youth with yellow curling","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5402",5160,"hair, and with his beard newly trimmed, mounted on a chestnut horse,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5403",5160,"whereof the legs were grey from the top of the forelegs, and from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5404",5160,"bend of the hindlegs downwards.  And the rider wore a coat of yellow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5405",5160,"satin sewn with green silk, and on his thigh was a gold-hilted sword,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5406",5160,"with a scabbard of new leather of Cordova, belted with the skin of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5407",5160,"deer, and clasped with gold.  And over this was a scarf of yellow satin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5408",5160,"wrought with green silk, the borders whereof were likewise green.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5409",5160,"the green of the caparison of the horse, and of his rider, was as green","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5410",5160,"as the leaves of the fir-tree, and the yellow was as yellow as the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5411",5160,"blossom of the broom.  So fierce was the aspect of the knight, that fear","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5412",5160,"seized upon them, and they began to flee.  And the knight pursued them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5413",5160,"And when the horse breathed forth, the men became distant from him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5414",5160,"when he drew in his breath, they were drawn near to him, even to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5415",5160,"horse’s chest.  And when he had overtaken them, they besought his mercy.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5416",5160,"“You have it gladly,” said he, “fear nought.”  “Ha, chieftain, since thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5417",5160,"hast mercy upon me, tell me also who thou art,” said Rhonabwy.  “I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5418",5160,"not conceal my lineage from thee, I am Iddawc the son of Mynyo, yet not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5421",5160,"“Ha, chieftain,” said Rhonabwy, “why art thou called thus?”  “I will tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5422",5160,"thee.  I was one of the messengers between Arthur and Medrawd his nephew,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5423",5160,"at the battle of Camlan; and I was then a reckless youth, and through my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5424",5160,"desire for battle, I kindled strife between them, and stirred up wrath,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5425",5160,"when I was sent by Arthur the Emperor to reason with Medrawd, and to show","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5427",5160,"lest the sons of the Kings of the Island of Britain, and of the nobles,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5428",5160,"should be slain.  And whereas Arthur charged me with the fairest sayings","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5430",5160,"And therefore am I called Iddawc Cordd Prydain, for from this did the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5435",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5436",5160,"Then lo! they heard a mighty sound which was much louder than that which","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5437",5160,"they had heard before, and when they looked round towards the sound, they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5438",5160,"beheld a ruddy youth, without beard or whiskers, noble of mien, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5439",5160,"mounted on a stately courser.  And from the shoulders and the front of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5440",5160,"the knees downwards the horse was bay.  And upon the man was a dress of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5441",5160,"red satin wrought with yellow silk, and yellow were the borders of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5442",5160,"scarf.  And such parts of his apparel and of the trappings of his horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5443",5160,"as were yellow, as yellow were they as the blossom of the broom, and such","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5444",5160,"as were red, were as ruddy as the ruddiest blood in the world.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5445",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5446",5160,"Then, behold the horseman overtook them, and he asked of Iddawc a share","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5447",5160,"of the little men that were with him.  “That which is fitting for me to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5448",5160,"grant I will grant, and thou shalt be a companion to them as I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5449",5160,"been.”  And the horseman went away.  “Iddawc,” inquired Rhonabwy, “who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5450",5160,"was that horseman?”  “Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince Deorthach.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5451",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5452",5160,"And they journeyed over the plain of Argyngroeg as far as the ford of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5453",5160,"Rhyd y Groes on the Severn.  And for a mile around the ford on both sides","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5454",5160,"of the road, they saw tents and encampments, and there was the clamour of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5455",5160,"a mighty host.  And they came to the edge of the ford, and there they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5456",5160,"beheld Arthur sitting on a flat island below the ford, having Bedwini the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5457",5160,"Bishop on one side of him, and Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw on the other.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5458",5160,"And a tall, auburn-haired youth stood before him, with his sheathed sword","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5459",5160,"in his hand, and clad in a coat and cap of jet-black satin.  And his face","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5460",5160,"was white as ivory, and his eyebrows black as jet, and such part of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5461",5160,"wrist as could be seen between his glove and his sleeve, was whiter than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5462",5160,"the lily, and thicker than a warrior’s ankle.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5463",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5464",5160,"Then came Iddawc and they that were with him, and stood before Arthur and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5465",5160,"saluted him.  “Heaven grant thee good,” said Arthur.  “And where, Iddawc,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5466",5160,"didst thou find these little men?”  “I found them, lord, up yonder on the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5467",5160,"road.”  Then the Emperor smiled.  “Lord,” said Iddawc, “wherefore dost","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5468",5160,"thou laugh?”  “Iddawc,” replied Arthur, “I laugh not; but it pitieth me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5469",5160,"that men of such stature as these should have this island in their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5470",5160,"keeping, after the men that guarded it of yore.”  Then said Iddawc,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5471",5160,"“Rhonabwy, dost thou see the ring with a stone set in it, that is upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5472",5160,"the Emperor’s hand?”  “I see it,” he answered.  “It is one of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5473",5160,"properties of that stone to enable thee to remember that thou seest here","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5474",5160,"to-night, and hadst thou not seen the stone, thou wouldest never have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5475",5160,"been able to remember aught thereof.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5476",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5477",5160,"After this they saw a troop coming towards the ford.  “Iddawc,” inquired","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5478",5160,"Rhonabwy, “to whom does yonder troop belong?”  “They are the fellows of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5479",5160,"Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince Deorthach.  And these men are honourably","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5480",5160,"served with mead and bragget, and are freely beloved by the daughters of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5481",5160,"the kings of the Island of Britain.  And this they merit, for they were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5482",5160,"ever in the front and the rear in every peril.”  And he saw but one hue","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5483",5160,"upon the men and the horses of this troop, for they were all as red as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5484",5160,"blood.  And when one of the knights rode forth from the troop, he looked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5485",5160,"like a pillar of fire glancing athwart the sky.  And this troop encamped","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5486",5160,"above the ford.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5487",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5488",5160,"Then they beheld another troop coming towards the ford, and these from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5489",5160,"their horses’ chests upwards were whiter than the lily, and below blacker","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5490",5160,"than jet.  And they saw one of these knights go before the rest, and spur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5491",5160,"his horse into the ford in such a manner that the water dashed over","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5492",5160,"Arthur and the Bishop, and those holding counsel with them, so that they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5493",5160,"were as wet as if they had been drenched in the river.  And as he turned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5494",5160,"the head of his horse, the youth who stood before Arthur struck the horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5495",5160,"over the nostrils with his sheathed sword, so that, had it been with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5496",5160,"bare blade, it would have been a marvel if the bone had not been wounded","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5497",5160,"as well as the flesh.  And the knight drew his sword half out of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5498",5160,"scabbard, and asked of him, “Wherefore didst thou strike my horse?","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5499",5160,"Whether was it in insult or in counsel unto me?”  “Thou dost indeed lack","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5500",5160,"counsel.  What madness caused thee to ride so furiously as to dash the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5501",5160,"water of the ford over Arthur, and the consecrated Bishop, and their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5502",5160,"counsellors, so that they were as wet as if they had been dragged out of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5503",5160,"the river?”  “As counsel then will I take it.”  So he turned his horse’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5504",5160,"head round towards his army.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5505",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5506",5160,"“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who was yonder knight?”  “The most eloquent and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5508",5160,"“Who was the man that struck his horse?”  “A youth of froward nature;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5510",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5511",5160,"Then spake a tall and stately man, of noble and flowing speech, saying","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5512",5160,"that it was a marvel that so vast a host should be assembled in so narrow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5513",5160,"a space, and that it was a still greater marvel that those should be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5514",5160,"there at that time who had promised to be by mid-day in the battle of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5515",5160,"Badon, fighting with Osla Gyllellvawr.  “Whether thou mayest choose to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5516",5160,"proceed or not, I will proceed.”  “Thou sayest well,” said Arthur, “and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5517",5160,"we will go altogether.”  “Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who was the man who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5518",5160,"spoke so marvellously unto Arthur erewhile?”  “A man who may speak as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5519",5160,"boldly as he listeth, Caradawc Vreichvras, the son of Llyr Marini, his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5521",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5522",5160,"Then Iddawc took Rhonabwy behind him on his horse, and that mighty host","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5523",5160,"moved forward, each troop in its order, towards Cevndigoll.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5524",5160,"they came to the middle of the ford of the Severn, Iddawc turned his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5525",5160,"horse’s head, and Rhonabwy looked along the valley of the Severn.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5526",5160,"beheld two fair troops coming towards the ford.  One troop there came of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5527",5160,"brilliant white, whereof every one of the men had a scarf of white satin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5528",5160,"with jet-black borders.  And the knees and the tops of the shoulders of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5529",5160,"their horses were jet-black, though they were of a pure white in every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5530",5160,"other part.  And their banners were pure white, with black points to them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5531",5160,"all.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5532",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5533",5160,"“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who are yonder pure white troop?”  “They are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5534",5160,"the men of Norway, and March the son of Meirchion is their prince.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5535",5160,"he is cousin unto Arthur.”  And further on he saw a troop, whereof each","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5536",5160,"man wore garments of jet-black, with borders of pure white to every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5537",5160,"scarf; and the tops of the shoulders and the knees of their horses were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5538",5160,"pure white.  And their banners were jet-black with pure white at the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5539",5160,"point of each.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5540",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5541",5160,"“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who are the jet-black troop yonder?”  “They are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5543",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5544",5160,"And when they had overtaken the host, Arthur and his army of mighty ones","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5545",5160,"dismounted below Caer Badou, and he perceived that he and Iddawc","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5546",5160,"journeyed the same road as Arthur.  And after they had dismounted he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5547",5160,"heard a great tumult and confusion amongst the host, and such as were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5548",5160,"then at the flanks turned to the centre, and such as had been in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5549",5160,"centre moved to the flanks.  And then, behold, he saw a knight coming,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5550",5160,"clad, both he and his horse, in mail, of which the rings were whiter than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5551",5160,"the whitest lily, and the rivets redder than the ruddiest blood.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5552",5160,"rode amongst the host.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5553",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5554",5160,"“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “will yonder host flee?”  “King Arthur never","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5555",5160,"fled, and if this discourse of thine were heard, thou wert a lost man.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5556",5160,"But as to the knight whom thou seest yonder, it is Kai.  The fairest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5557",5160,"horseman is Kai in all Arthur’s Court; and the men who are at the front","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5558",5160,"of the army hasten to the rear to see Kai ride, and the men who are in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5559",5160,"the centre flee to the side, from the shock of his horse.  And this is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5560",5160,"the cause of the confusion of the host.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5561",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5562",5160,"Thereupon they heard a call made for Kadwr, Earl of Cornwall, and behold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5563",5160,"he arose with the sword of Arthur in his hand.  And the similitude of two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5564",5160,"serpents was upon the sword in gold.  And when the sword was drawn from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5565",5160,"its scabbard, it seemed as if two flames of fire burst forth from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5566",5160,"jaws of the serpents, and then, so wonderful was the sword, that it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5567",5160,"hard for any one to look upon it.  And the host became still, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5568",5160,"tumult ceased, and the Earl returned to the tent.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5569",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5570",5160,"“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who is the man who bore the sword of Arthur?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5573",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5576",5160,"And behold he came upon a tall red horse with the mane parted on each","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5577",5160,"side, and he brought with him a large and beautiful sumpter pack.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5578",5160,"the huge red youth dismounted before Arthur, and he drew a golden chair","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5579",5160,"out of the pack, and a carpet of diapered satin.  And he spread the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5580",5160,"carpet before Arthur, and there was an apple of ruddy gold at each corner","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5581",5160,"thereof, and he placed the chair upon the carpet.  And so large was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5582",5160,"chair that three armed warriors might have sat therein.  Gwenn was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5583",5160,"name of the carpet, and it was one of its properties that whoever was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5584",5160,"upon it no one could see him, and he could see every one.  And it would","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5585",5160,"retain no colour but its own.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5586",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5587",5160,"And Arthur sat within the carpet, and Owain the son of Urien was standing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5589",5160,"Lord,” said Owain.  And the red youth brought the chess for Arthur and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5590",5160,"Owain; golden pieces and a board of silver.  And they began to play.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5591",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5592",5160,"And while they were thus, and when they were best amused with their game,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5593",5160,"behold they saw a white tent with a red canopy, and the figure of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5594",5160,"jet-black serpent on the top of the tent, and red glaring venomous eyes","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5595",5160,"in the head of the serpent, and a red flaming tongue.  And there came a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5596",5160,"young page with yellow curling hair, and blue eyes, and a newly-springing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5597",5160,"beard, wearing a coat and a surcoat of yellow satin, and hose of thin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5598",5160,"greenish-yellow cloth upon his feet, and over his hose shoes of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5599",5160,"parti-coloured leather, fastened at the insteps with golden clasps.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5600",5160,"he bore a heavy three-edged sword with a golden hilt, in a scabbard of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5601",5160,"black leather tipped with fine gold.  And he came to the place where the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5605",5160,"salute him and should not have saluted the Emperor Arthur.  And Arthur","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5606",5160,"knew what was in Owain’s thought.  And he said to Owain, “Marvel not that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5607",5160,"the youth salutes thee now, for he saluted me erewhile; and it is unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5608",5160,"thee that his errand is.”  Then said the youth unto Owain, “Lord, is it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5609",5160,"with thy leave that the young pages and attendants of the Emperor harass","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5610",5160,"and torment and worry thy Ravens?  And if it be not with thy leave, cause","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5617",5160,"and large eyes, well-grown, and having his beard new-shorn, came forth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5618",5160,"from a bright yellow tent, upon the summit of which was the figure of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5619",5160,"bright red lion.  And he was clad in a coat of yellow satin, falling as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5620",5160,"low as the small of his leg, and embroidered with threads of red silk.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5621",5160,"And on his feet were hose of fine white buckram, and buskins of black","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5625",5160,"playing at chess.  And he saluted him.  And Owain was troubled at his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5626",5160,"salutation, but Arthur minded it no more than before.  And the youth said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5634",5160,"the first move of the game, they beheld at a small distance from them a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5635",5160,"tent speckled yellow, the largest ever seen, and the figure of an eagle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5636",5160,"of gold upon it, and a precious stone on the eagle’s head.  And coming","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5637",5160,"out of the tent, they saw a youth with thick yellow hair upon his head,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5638",5160,"fair and comely, and a scarf of blue satin upon him, and a brooch of gold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5639",5160,"in the scarf upon his right shoulder as large as a warrior’s middle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5640",5160,"finger.  And upon his feet were hose of fine Totness, and shoes of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5641",5160,"parti-coloured leather, clasped with gold, and the youth was of noble","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5642",5160,"bearing, fair of face, with ruddy cheeks and large hawk’s eyes.  In the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5643",5160,"hand of the youth was a mighty lance, speckled yellow, with a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5644",5160,"newly-sharpened head; and upon the lance a banner displayed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5645",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5646",5160,"Fiercely angry, and with rapid pace, came the youth to the place where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5647",5160,"Arthur was playing at chess with Owain.  And they perceived that he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5648",5160,"wroth.  And thereupon he saluted Owain, and told him that his Ravens had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5649",5160,"been killed, the chief part of them, and that such of them as were not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5650",5160,"slain were so wounded and bruised that not one of them could raise its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5651",5160,"wings a single fathom above the earth.  “Lord,” said Owain, “forbid thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5652",5160,"men.”  “Play,” said he, “if it please thee.”  Then said Owain to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5653",5160,"youth, “Go back, and wherever thou findest the strife at the thickest,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5654",5160,"there lift up the banner, and let come what pleases Heaven.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5655",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5656",5160,"So the youth returned back to the place where the strife bore hardest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5657",5160,"upon the Ravens, and he lifted up the banner; and as he did so they all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5658",5160,"rose up in the air, wrathful and fierce and high of spirit, clapping","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5659",5160,"their wings in the wind, and shaking off the weariness that was upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5660",5160,"them.  And recovering their energy and courage, furiously and with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5661",5160,"exultation did they, with one sweep, descend upon the heads of the men,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5662",5160,"who had erewhile caused them anger and pain and damage, and they seized","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5663",5160,"some by the heads and others by the eyes, and some by the ears, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5664",5160,"others by the arms, and carried them up into the air; and in the air","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5665",5160,"there was a mighty tumult with the flapping of the wings of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5666",5160,"triumphant Ravens, and with their croaking; and there was another mighty","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5667",5160,"tumult with the groaning of the men, that were being torn and wounded,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5668",5160,"and some of whom were slain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5669",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5670",5160,"And Arthur and Owain marvelled at the tumult as they played at chess;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5671",5160,"and, looking, they perceived a knight upon a dun-coloured horse coming","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5672",5160,"towards them.  And marvellous was the hue of the dun horse.  Bright red","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5673",5160,"was his right shoulder, and from the top of his legs to the centre of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5674",5160,"hoof was bright yellow.  Both the knight and his horse were fully","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5675",5160,"equipped with heavy foreign armour.  The clothing of the horse from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5676",5160,"front opening upwards was of bright red sendal, and from thence opening","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5677",5160,"downwards was of bright yellow sendal.  A large gold-hilted one-edged","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5678",5160,"sword had the youth upon his thigh, in a scabbard of light blue, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5679",5160,"tipped with Spanish laton.  The belt of the sword was of dark green","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5680",5160,"leather with golden slides and a clasp of ivory upon it, and a buckle of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5681",5160,"jet-black upon the clasp.  A helmet of gold was on the head of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5682",5160,"knight, set with precious stones of great virtue, and at the top of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5683",5160,"helmet was the image of a flame-coloured leopard with two ruby-red stones","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5684",5160,"in its head, so that it was astounding for a warrior, however stout his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5685",5160,"heart, to look at the face of the leopard, much more at the face of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5686",5160,"knight.  He had in his hand a blue-shafted lance, but from the haft to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5687",5160,"the point it was stained crimson-red with the blood of the Ravens and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5688",5160,"their plumage.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5689",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5690",5160,"The knight came to the place where Arthur and Owain were seated at chess.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5691",5160,"And they perceived that he was harassed and vexed and weary as he came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5692",5160,"towards them.  And the youth saluted Arthur, and told him that the Ravens","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5693",5160,"of Owain were slaying his young men and attendants.  And Arthur looked at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5694",5160,"Owain and said, “Forbid thy Ravens.”  “Lord,” answered Owain, “play thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5695",5160,"game.”  And they played.  And the knight returned back towards the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5696",5160,"strife, and the Ravens were not forbidden any more than before.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5697",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5698",5160,"And when they had played awhile, they heard a mighty tumult, and a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5699",5160,"wailing of men, and a croaking of Ravens, as they carried the men in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5700",5160,"their strength into the air, and, tearing them betwixt them, let them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5701",5160,"fall piecemeal to the earth.  And during the tumult they saw a knight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5702",5160,"coming towards them, on a light grey horse, and the left foreleg of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5703",5160,"horse was jet-black to the centre of his hoof.  And the knight and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5704",5160,"horse were fully accoutred with huge heavy blue armour.  And a robe of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5705",5160,"honour of yellow diapered satin was upon the knight, and the borders of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5706",5160,"the robe were blue.  And the housings of the horse were jet-black, with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5707",5160,"borders of bright yellow.  And on the thigh of the youth was a sword,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5708",5160,"long, and three-edged, and heavy.  And the scabbard was of red cut","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5709",5160,"leather, and the belt of new red deer-skin, having upon it many golden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5710",5160,"slides and a buckle of the bone of the sea-horse, the tongue of which was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5711",5160,"jet-black.  A golden helmet was upon the head of the knight, wherein were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5712",5160,"set sapphire-stones of great virtue.  And at the top of the helmet was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5713",5160,"the figure of a flame-coloured lion, with a fiery-red tongue, issuing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5714",5160,"above a foot from his mouth, and with venomous eyes, crimson-red, in his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5715",5160,"head.  And the knight came, bearing in his hand a thick ashen lance, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5716",5160,"head whereof, which had been newly steeped in blood, was overlaid with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5717",5160,"silver.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5718",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5719",5160,"And the youth saluted the Emperor: “Lord,” said he, “carest thou not for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5720",5160,"the slaying of thy pages, and thy young men, and the sons of the nobles","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5721",5160,"of the Island of Britain, whereby it will be difficult to defend this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5722",5160,"island from henceforward for ever?”  “Owain,” said Arthur, “forbid thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5723",5160,"Ravens.”  “Play this game, Lord,” said Owain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5724",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5725",5160,"So they finished the game and began another; and as they were finishing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5726",5160,"that game, lo, they heard a great tumult and a clamour of armed men, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5727",5160,"a croaking of Ravens, and a flapping of wings in the air, as they flung","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5728",5160,"down the armour entire to the ground, and the men and the horses","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5729",5160,"piecemeal.  Then they saw coming a knight on a lofty-headed piebald","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5730",5160,"horse.  And the left shoulder of the horse was of bright red, and its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5731",5160,"right leg from the chest to the hollow of the hoof was pure white.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5732",5160,"the knight and horse were equipped with arms of speckled yellow,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5733",5160,"variegated with Spanish laton.  And there was a robe of honour upon him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5734",5160,"and upon his horse, divided in two parts, white and black, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5735",5160,"borders of the robe of honour were of golden purple.  And above the robe","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5736",5160,"he wore a sword three-edged and bright, with a golden hilt.  And the belt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5737",5160,"of the sword was of yellow goldwork, having a clasp upon it of the eyelid","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5738",5160,"of a black sea-horse, and a tongue of yellow gold to the clasp.  Upon the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5739",5160,"head of the knight was a bright helmet of yellow laton, with sparkling","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5740",5160,"stones of crystal in it, and at the crest of the helmet was the figure of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5741",5160,"a griffin, with a stone of many virtues in its head.  And he had an ashen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5742",5160,"spear in his hand, with a round shaft, coloured with azure blue.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5743",5160,"head of the spear was newly stained with blood, and was overlaid with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5744",5160,"fine silver.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5745",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5746",5160,"Wrathfully came the knight to the place where Arthur was, and he told him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5747",5160,"that the Ravens had slain his household and the sons of the chief men of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5748",5160,"this island, and he besought him to cause Owain to forbid his Ravens.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5749",5160,"And Arthur besought Owain to forbid them.  Then Arthur took the golden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5750",5160,"chessmen that were upon the board, and crushed them until they became as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5751",5160,"dust.  Then Owain ordered Gwres the son of Rheged to lower his banner.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5752",5160,"So it was lowered, and all was peace.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5753",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5754",5160,"Then Rhonabwy inquired of Iddawc who were the first three men that came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5755",5160,"to Owain, to tell him his Ravens were being slain.  Said Iddawc, “They","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5756",5160,"were men who grieved that Owain should suffer loss, his fellow-chieftains","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5757",5160,"and companions, Selyv the son of Kynan Garwyn of Powys, and Gwgawn","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5758",5160,"Gleddyvrudd, and Gwres the son of Rheged, he who bears the banner in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5759",5160,"day of battle and strife.”  “Who,” said Rhonabwy, “were the last three","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5760",5160,"men who came to Arthur, and told him that the Ravens were slaughtering","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5761",5160,"his men?”  “The best of men,” said Iddawc, “and the bravest, and who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5762",5160,"would grieve exceedingly that Arthur should have damage in aught;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5763",5160,"Blathaon the son of Mawrheth, and Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5765",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5766",5160,"And with that behold four-and-twenty knights came from Osla Gyllellvawr,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5767",5160,"to crave a truce of Arthur for a fortnight and a month.  And Arthur rose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5768",5160,"and went to take counsel.  And he came to where a tall, auburn,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5769",5160,"curly-headed man was a little way off, and there he assembled his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5793",5160,"into counsel with men of such dignity as are yonder a stripling so young","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5794",5160,"as Kadyriaith the son of Saidi?”  “Because there is not throughout","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5800",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5801",5160,"And lo, there came four-and-twenty asses with their burdens of gold and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5802",5160,"of silver, and a tired way-worn man with each of them, bringing tribute","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5803",5160,"to Arthur from the Islands of Greece.  Then Kadyriaith the son of Saidi","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5804",5160,"besought that a truce might be granted to Osla Gyllellvawr for the space","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5805",5160,"of a fortnight and a month, and that the asses and the burdens they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5806",5160,"carried might be given to the bards, to be to them as the reward for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5807",5160,"their stay and that their verse might be recompensed during the time of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5808",5160,"the truce.  And thus it was settled.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5809",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5810",5160,"“Rhonabwy,” said Iddawc, “would it not be wrong to forbid a youth who can","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5831",5160,"PWYLL PRINCE OF DYVED was lord of the seven Cantrevs of Dyved; and once","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5832",5160,"upon a time he was at Narberth his chief palace, and he was minded to go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5833",5160,"and hunt, and the part of his dominions in which it pleased him to hunt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5834",5160,"was Glyn Cuch.  So he set forth from Narbeth that night, and went as far","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5835",5160,"as Llwyn Diarwyd.  And that night he tarried there, and early on the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5836",5160,"morrow he rose and came to Glyn Cuch, when he let loose the dogs in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5837",5160,"wood, and sounded the horn, and began the chase.  And as he followed the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5838",5160,"dogs, he lost his companions; and whilst he listened to the hounds, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5839",5160,"heard the cry of other hounds, a cry different from his own, and coming","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5840",5160,"in the opposite direction.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5841",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5842",5160,"And he beheld a glade in the wood forming a level plain, and as his dogs","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5843",5160,"came to the edge of the glade, he saw a stag before the other dogs.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5844",5160,"lo, as it reached the middle of the glade, the dogs that followed the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5845",5160,"stag overtook it and brought it down.  Then looked he at the colour of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5846",5160,"the dogs, staying not to look at the stag, and of all the hounds that he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5847",5160,"had seen in the world, he had never seen any that were like unto these.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5848",5160,"For their hair was of a brilliant shining white, and their ears were red;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5849",5160,"and as the whiteness of their bodies shone, so did the redness of their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5850",5160,"ears glisten.  And he came towards the dogs, and drove away those that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5851",5160,"had brought down the stag, and set his own dogs upon it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5852",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5853",5160,"And as he was setting on his dogs he saw a horseman coming towards him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5854",5160,"upon a large light-grey steed, with a hunting horn round his neck, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5855",5160,"clad in garments of grey woollen in the fashion of a hunting garb.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5856",5160,"the horseman drew near and spoke unto him thus.  “Chieftain,” said he, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5857",5160,"know who thou art, and I greet thee not.”  “Peradventure,” said Pwyll,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5858",5160,"“thou art of such dignity that thou shouldest not do so.”  “Verily,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5859",5160,"answered he, “it is not my dignity that prevents me.”  “What is it then,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5860",5160,"O Chieftain?” asked he.  “By Heaven, it is by reason of thine own","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5861",5160,"ignorance and want of courtesy.”  “What discourtesy, Chieftain, hast thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5862",5160,"seen in me?”  “Greater discourtesy saw I never in man,” said he, “than to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5863",5160,"drive away the dogs that were killing the stag and to set upon it thine","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5864",5160,"own.  This was discourteous, and though I may not be revenged upon thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5865",5160,"yet I declare to Heaven that I will do thee more dishonour than the value","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5866",5160,"of an hundred stags.”  “O Chieftain,” he replied, “if I have done ill I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5867",5160,"will redeem thy friendship.”  “How wilt thou redeem it?”  “According as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5868",5160,"thy dignity may be, but I know not who thou art?”  “A crowned king am I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5869",5160,"in the land whence I come.”  “Lord,” said he, “may the day prosper with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5870",5160,"thee, and from what land comest thou?”  “From Annwvyn,” {2} answered he;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5871",5160,"“Arawn, a King of Annwvyn, am I.”  “Lord,” said he, “how may I gain thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5872",5160,"friendship?”  “After this manner mayest thou,” he said.  “There is a man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5873",5160,"whose dominions are opposite to mine, who is ever warring against me, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5874",5160,"he is Havgan, a King of Annwvyn, and by ridding me of this oppression,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5875",5160,"which thou canst easily do, shalt thou gain my friendship.”  “Gladly will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5876",5160,"I do this,” said he.  “Show me how I may.”  “I will show thee.  Behold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5877",5160,"thus it is thou mayest.  I will make firm friendship with thee; and this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5878",5160,"will I do.  I will send thee to Annwvyn in my stead, and I will give thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5879",5160,"the fairest lady thou didst ever behold to be thy companion, and I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5880",5160,"put my form and semblance upon thee, so that not a page of the chamber,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5881",5160,"nor an officer, nor any other man that has always followed me shall know","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5882",5160,"that it is not I.  And this shall be for the space of a year from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5883",5160,"to-morrow, and then we will meet in this place.”  “Yes,” said he; “but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5884",5160,"when I shall have been there for the space of a year, by what means shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5885",5160,"I discover him of whom thou speakest?”  “One year from this night,” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5886",5160,"answered, “is the time fixed between him and me that we should meet at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5887",5160,"the Ford; be thou there in my likeness, and with one stroke that thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5888",5160,"givest him, he shall no longer live.  And if he ask thee to give him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5889",5160,"another, give it not, how much soever he may entreat thee, for when I did","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5890",5160,"so, he fought with me next day as well as ever before.”  “Verily,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5891",5160,"Pwyll, “what shall I do concerning my kingdom?”  Said Arawn, “I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5892",5160,"cause that no one in all thy dominions, neither man nor woman, shall know","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5893",5160,"that I am not thou, and I will go there in thy stead.”  “Gladly then,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5894",5160,"said Pwyll, “will I set forward.”  “Clear shall be thy path, and nothing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5895",5160,"shall detain thee, until thou come into my dominions, and I myself will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5896",5160,"be thy guide!”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5897",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5898",5160,"So he conducted him until he came in sight of the palace and its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5899",5160,"dwellings.  “Behold,” said he, “the Court and the kingdom in thy power.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5900",5160,"Enter the Court, there is no one there who will know thee, and when thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5901",5160,"seest what service is done there, thou wilt know the customs of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5902",5160,"Court.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5903",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5904",5160,"So he went forward to the Court, and when he came there, he beheld","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5905",5160,"sleeping-rooms, and halls, and chambers, and the most beautiful buildings","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5906",5160,"ever seen.  And he went into the hall to disarray, and there came youths","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5907",5160,"and pages and disarrayed him, and all as they entered saluted him.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5908",5160,"two knights came and drew his hunting-dress from about him, and clothed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5909",5160,"him in a vesture of silk and gold.  And the hall was prepared, and behold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5910",5160,"he saw the household and the host enter in, and the host was the most","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5911",5160,"comely and the best equipped that he had ever seen.  And with them came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5912",5160,"in likewise the Queen, who was the fairest woman that he had ever yet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5913",5160,"beheld.  And she had on a yellow robe of shining satin; and they washed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5914",5160,"and went to the table, and sat, the Queen upon one side of him, and one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5915",5160,"who seemed to be an Earl on the other side.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5916",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5917",5160,"And he began to speak with the Queen, and he thought, from her speech,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5918",5160,"that she was the seemliest and most noble lady of converse and of cheer","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5919",5160,"that ever was.  And they partook of meat, and drink, with songs and with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5920",5160,"feasting; and of all the Courts upon the earth, behold this was the best","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5921",5160,"supplied with food and drink, and vessels of gold and royal jewels.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5926",5160,"diversions, and discourse with his companions until the night that was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5927",5160,"fixed for the conflict.  And when that night came, it was remembered even","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5928",5160,"by those who lived in the furthest part of his dominions, and he went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5929",5160,"the meeting, and the nobles of the kingdom with him.  And when he came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5930",5160,"the Ford, a knight arose and spake thus.  “Lords,” said he, “listen well.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5931",5160,"It is between two kings that this meeting is, and between them only.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5932",5160,"Each claimeth of the other his land and territory, and do all of you","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5933",5160,"stand aside and leave the fight to be between them.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5934",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5935",5160,"Thereupon the two kings approached each other in the middle of the Ford,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5936",5160,"and encountered, and at the first thrust, the man who was in the stead of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5937",5160,"Arawn struck Havgan on the centre of the boss of his shield, so that it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5938",5160,"was cloven in twain, and his armour was broken, and Havgan himself was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5939",5160,"borne to the ground an arm’s and a spear’s length over the crupper of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5940",5160,"horse, and he received a deadly blow.  “O Chieftain,” said Havgan, “what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5941",5160,"right hast thou to cause my death?  I was not injuring thee in anything,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5942",5160,"and I know not wherefore thou wouldest slay me.  But, for the love of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5943",5160,"Heaven, since thou hast begun to slay me, complete thy work.”  “Ah,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5944",5160,"Chieftain,” he replied, “I may yet repent doing that unto thee, slay thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5945",5160,"who may, I will not do so.”  “My trusty Lords,” said Havgan, “bear me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5946",5160,"hence.  My death has come.  I shall be no more able to uphold you.”  “My","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5947",5160,"Nobles,” also said he who was in the semblance of Arawn, “take counsel","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5948",5160,"and know who ought to be my subjects.”  “Lord,” said the Nobles, “all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5949",5160,"should be, for there is no king over the whole of Annwvyn but thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5950",5160,"“Yes,” he replied, “it is right that he who comes humbly should be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5951",5160,"received graciously, but he that doth not come with obedience, shall be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5952",5160,"compelled by the force of swords.”  And thereupon he received the homage","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5953",5160,"of the men, and he began to conquer the country; and the next day by noon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5954",5160,"the two kingdoms were in his power.  And thereupon he went to keep his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5955",5160,"tryst, and came to Glyn Cuch.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5956",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5957",5160,"And when he came there, the King of Annwvyn was there to meet him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5958",5160,"each of them was rejoiced to see the other.  “Verily,” said Arawn, “may","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5959",5160,"Heaven reward thee for thy friendship towards me.  I have heard of it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5960",5160,"When thou comest thyself to thy dominions,” said he, “thou wilt see that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5961",5160,"which I have done for thee.”  “Whatever thou hast done for me, may Heaven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5962",5160,"repay it thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5963",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5964",5160,"Then Arawn gave to Pwyll Prince of Dyved his proper form and semblance,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5965",5160,"and he himself took his own; and Arawn set forth towards the Court of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5966",5160,"Annwvyn; and he was rejoiced when he beheld his hosts, and his household,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5967",5160,"whom he had not seen so long; but they had not known of his absence, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5968",5160,"wondered no more at his coming than usual.  And that day was spent in joy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5969",5160,"and merriment; and he sat and conversed with his wife and his nobles.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5970",5160,"And when it was time for them rather to sleep than to carouse, they went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5971",5160,"to rest.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5974",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5975",5160,"Pwyll Prince of Dyved came likewise to his country and dominions, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5976",5160,"began to inquire of the nobles of the land, how his rule had been during","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5977",5160,"the past year, compared with what it had been before.  “Lord,” said they,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5978",5160,"“thy wisdom was never so great, and thou wast never so kind or so free in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5979",5160,"bestowing thy gifts, and thy justice was never more worthily seen than in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5980",5160,"this year.”  “By Heaven,” said he, “for all the good you have enjoyed,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5981",5160,"you should thank him who hath been with you; for behold, thus hath this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5982",5160,"matter been.”  And thereupon Pwyll related the whole unto them.  “Verily,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5983",5160,"Lord,” said they, “render thanks unto Heaven that thou hast such a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5984",5160,"fellowship, and withhold not from us the rule which we have enjoyed for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5985",5160,"this year past.”  “I take Heaven to witness that I will not withhold it,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5986",5160,"answered Pwyll.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5987",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5988",5160,"And thenceforth they made strong the friendship that was between them,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5989",5160,"and each sent unto the other horses, and greyhounds, and hawks, and all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5990",5160,"such jewels as they thought would be pleasing to each other.  And by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5991",5160,"reason of his having dwelt that year in Annwvyn, and having ruled there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5992",5160,"so prosperously, and united the two kingdoms in one day by his valour and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5993",5160,"prowess, he lost the name of Pwyll Prince of Dyved, and was called Pwyll","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5994",5160,"Chief of Annwvyn from that time forward.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"5998",5160,"Once upon a time, Pwyll was at Narberth his chief palace, where a feast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"5999",5160,"had been prepared for him, and with him was a great host of men.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6000",5160,"after the first meal, Pwyll arose to walk, and he went to the top of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6001",5160,"mound that was above the palace, and was called Gorsedd Arberth.  “Lord,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6002",5160,"said one of the Court, “it is peculiar to the mound that whosoever sits","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6003",5160,"upon it cannot go thence, without either receiving wounds or blows, or","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6004",5160,"else seeing a wonder.”  “I fear not to receive wounds and blows in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6005",5160,"midst of such a host as this, but as to the wonder, gladly would I see","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6006",5160,"it.  I will go therefore and sit upon the mound.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6007",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6008",5160,"And upon the mound he sat.  And while he sat there, they saw a lady, on a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6009",5160,"pure white horse of large size, with a garment of shining gold around","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6010",5160,"her, coming along the highway that led from the mound; and the horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6011",5160,"seemed to move at a slow and even pace, and to be coming up towards the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6012",5160,"mound.  “My men,” said Pwyll, “is there any among you who knows yonder","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6013",5160,"lady?”  “There is not, Lord,” said they.  “Go one of you and meet her,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6014",5160,"that we may know who she is.”  And one of them arose, and as he came upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6015",5160,"the road to meet her, she passed by, and he followed as fast as he could,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6016",5160,"being on foot; and the greater was his speed, the further was she from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6017",5160,"him.  And when he saw that it profited him nothing to follow her, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6018",5160,"returned to Pwyll, and said unto him, “Lord, it is idle for any one in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6019",5160,"the world to follow her on foot.”  “Verily,” said Pwyll, “go unto the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6020",5160,"palace, and take the fleetest horse that thou seest, and go after her.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6021",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6022",5160,"And he took a horse and went forward.  And he came to an open level","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6023",5160,"plain, and put spurs to his horse; and the more he urged his horse, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6024",5160,"further was she from him.  Yet she held the same pace as at first.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6025",5160,"his horse began to fail; and when his horse’s feet failed him, he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6026",5160,"returned to the place where Pwyll was.  “Lord,” said he, “it will avail","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6027",5160,"nothing for any one to follow yonder lady.  I know of no horse in these","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6028",5160,"realms swifter than this, and it availed me not to pursue her.”  “Of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6029",5160,"truth,” said Pwyll, “there must be some illusion here.  Let us go towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6030",5160,"the palace.”  So to the palace they went, and they spent that day.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6031",5160,"the next day they arose, and that also they spent until it was time to go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6032",5160,"to meat.  And after the first meal, “Verily,” said Pwyll, “we will go the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6033",5160,"same party as yesterday to the top of the mound.  And do thou,” said he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6034",5160,"to one of his young men, “take the swiftest horse that thou knowest in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6035",5160,"the field.”  And thus did the young man.  And they went towards the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6036",5160,"mound, taking the horse with them.  And as they were sitting down they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6037",5160,"beheld the lady on the same horse, and in the same apparel, coming along","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6038",5160,"the same road.  “Behold,” said Pwyll, “here is the lady of yesterday.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6039",5160,"Make ready, youth, to learn who she is.”  “My lord,” said he, “that will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6040",5160,"I gladly do.”  And thereupon the lady came opposite to them.  So the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6041",5160,"youth mounted his horse; and before he had settled himself in his saddle,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6042",5160,"she passed by, and there was a clear space between them.  But her speed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6043",5160,"was no greater than it had been the day before.  Then he put his horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6044",5160,"into an amble, and thought that notwithstanding the gentle pace at which","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6045",5160,"his horse went, he should soon overtake her.  But this availed him not;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6046",5160,"so he gave his horse the reins.  And still he came no nearer to her than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6047",5160,"when he went at a foot’s pace.  And the more he urged his horse, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6048",5160,"further was she from him.  Yet she rode not faster than before.  When he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6049",5160,"saw that it availed not to follow her, he returned to the place where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6050",5160,"Pwyll was.  “Lord,” said he, “the horse can no more than thou hast seen.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6051",5160,"“I see indeed that it avails not that any one should follow her.  And by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6052",5160,"Heaven,” said he, “she must needs have an errand to some one in this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6053",5160,"plain, if her haste would allow her to declare it.  Let us go back to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6054",5160,"palace.”  And to the palace they went, and they spent that night in songs","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6055",5160,"and feasting, as it pleased them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6056",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6057",5160,"And the next day they amused themselves until it was time to go to meat.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6058",5160,"And when meat was ended, Pwyll said, “Where are the hosts that went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6059",5160,"yesterday and the day before to the top of the mound?”  “Behold, Lord, we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6060",5160,"are here,” said they.  “Let us go,” said he, “to the mound, to sit there.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6061",5160,"And do thou,” said he to the page who tended his horse, “saddle my horse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6062",5160,"well, and hasten with him to the road, and bring also my spurs with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6063",5160,"thee.”  And the youth did thus.  And they went and sat upon the mound;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6064",5160,"and ere they had been there but a short time, they beheld the lady coming","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6065",5160,"by the same road, and in the same manner, and at the same pace.  “Young","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6066",5160,"man,” said Pwyll, “I see the lady coming; give me my horse.”  And no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6067",5160,"sooner had he mounted his horse than she passed him.  And he turned after","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6068",5160,"her and followed her.  And he let his horse go bounding playfully, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6069",5160,"thought that at the second step or the third he should come up with her.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6070",5160,"But he came no nearer to her than at first.  Then he urged his horse to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6071",5160,"his utmost speed, yet he found that it availed nothing to follow her.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6072",5160,"Then said Pwyll, “O maiden, for the sake of him whom thou best lovest,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6073",5160,"stay for me.”  “I will stay gladly,” said she, “and it were better for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6074",5160,"thy horse hadst thou asked it long since.”  So the maiden stopped, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6075",5160,"she threw back that part of her headdress which covered her face.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6076",5160,"she fixed her eyes upon him, and began to talk with him.  “Lady,” asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6077",5160,"he, “whence comest thou, and whereunto dost thou journey?”  “I journey on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6078",5160,"mine own errand,” said she, “and right glad am I to see thee.”  “My","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6079",5160,"greeting be unto thee,” said he.  Then he thought that the beauty of all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6080",5160,"the maidens, and all the ladies that he had ever seen, was as nothing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6081",5160,"compared to her beauty.  “Lady,” he said, “wilt thou tell me aught","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6082",5160,"concerning thy purpose?”  “I will tell thee,” said she.  “My chief quest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6083",5160,"was to seek thee.”  “Behold,” said Pwyll, “this is to me the most","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6084",5160,"pleasing quest on which thou couldst have come; and wilt thou tell me who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6085",5160,"thou art?”  “I will tell thee, Lord,” said she.  “I am Rhiannon, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6086",5160,"daughter of Heveydd Hên, and they sought to give me to a husband against","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6087",5160,"my will.  But no husband would I have, and that because of my love for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6088",5160,"thee, neither will I yet have one unless thou reject me.  And hither have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6089",5160,"I come to hear thy answer.”  “By Heaven,” said Pwyll, “behold this is my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6090",5160,"answer.  If I might choose among all the ladies and damsels in the world,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6091",5160,"thee would I choose.”  “Verily,” said she, “if thou art thus minded, make","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6092",5160,"a pledge to meet me ere I am given to another.”  “The sooner I may do so,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6093",5160,"the more pleasing will it be unto me,” said Pwyll, “and wheresoever thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6094",5160,"wilt, there will I meet with thee.”  “I will that thou meet me this day","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6095",5160,"twelvemonth at the palace of Heveydd.  And I will cause a feast to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6096",5160,"prepared, so that it be ready against thou come.”  “Gladly,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6097",5160,"“will I keep this tryst.”  “Lord,” said she, “remain in health, and be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6098",5160,"mindful that thou keep thy promise; and now I will go hence.”  So they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6099",5160,"parted, and he went back to his hosts and to them of his household.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6100",5160,"whatsoever questions they asked him respecting the damsel, he always","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6101",5160,"turned the discourse upon other matters.  And when a year from that time","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6102",5160,"was gone, he caused a hundred knights to equip themselves and to go with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6103",5160,"him to the palace of Heveydd Hên.  And he came to the palace, and there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6104",5160,"was great joy concerning him, with much concourse of people and great","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6105",5160,"rejoicing, and vast preparations for his coming.  And the whole Court was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6106",5160,"placed under his orders.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6107",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6108",5160,"And the hall was garnished and they went to meat, and thus did they sit;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6109",5160,"Heveydd Hên was on one side of Pwyll, and Rhiannon on the other.  And all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6110",5160,"the rest according to their rank.  And they ate and feasted and talked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6111",5160,"one with another, and at the beginning of the carousal after the meat,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6112",5160,"there entered a tall auburn-haired youth, of royal bearing, clothed in a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6113",5160,"garment of satin.  And when he came into the hall, he saluted Pwyll and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6114",5160,"his companions.  “The greeting of Heaven be unto thee, my soul,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6115",5160,"Pwyll, “come thou and sit down.”  “Nay,” said he, “a suitor am I, and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6116",5160,"will do mine errand.”  “Do so willingly,” said Pwyll.  “Lord,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6117",5160,"“my errand is unto thee, and it is to crave a boon of thee that I come.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6118",5160,"“What boon soever thou mayest ask of me, as far as I am able, thou shalt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6119",5160,"have.”  “Ah,” said Rhiannon, “wherefore didst thou give that answer?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6120",5160,"“Has he not given it before the presence of these nobles?” asked the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6121",5160,"youth.  “My soul,” said Pwyll, “what is the boon thou askest?”  “The lady","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6122",5160,"whom best I love is to be thy bride this night; I come to ask her of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6123",5160,"thee, with the feast and the banquet that are in this place.”  And Pwyll","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6124",5160,"was silent because of the answer which he had given.  “Be silent as long","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6125",5160,"as thou wilt,” said Rhiannon.  “Never did man make worse use of his wits","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6126",5160,"than thou hast done.”  “Lady,” said he, “I knew not who he was.”  “Behold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6127",5160,"this is the man to whom they would have given me against my will,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6128",5160,"she.  “And he is Gwawl the son of Clud, a man of great power and wealth,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6129",5160,"and because of the word thou hast spoken, bestow me upon him lest shame","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6130",5160,"befall thee.”  “Lady,” said he, “I understand not thine answer.  Never","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6131",5160,"can I do as thou sayest.”  “Bestow me upon him,” said she, “and I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6132",5160,"cause that I shall never be his.”  “By what means will that be?” asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6133",5160,"Pwyll.  “In thy hand will I give thee a small bag,” said she.  “See that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6134",5160,"thou keep it well, and he will ask of thee the banquet, and the feast,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6135",5160,"and the preparations which are not in thy power.  Unto the hosts and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6136",5160,"household will I give the feast.  And such will be thy answer respecting","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6137",5160,"this.  And as concerns myself, I will engage to become his bride this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6138",5160,"night twelvemonth.  And at the end of the year be thou here,” said she,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6139",5160,"“and bring this bag with thee, and let thy hundred knights be in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6140",5160,"orchard up yonder.  And when he is in the midst of joy and feasting, come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6141",5160,"thou in by thyself, clad in ragged garments, and holding thy bag in thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6142",5160,"hand, and ask nothing but a bagful of food, and I will cause that if all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6143",5160,"the meat and liquor that are in these seven Cantrevs were put into it, it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6144",5160,"would be no fuller than before.  And after a great deal has been put","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6145",5160,"therein, he will ask thee whether thy bag will ever be full.  Say thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6146",5160,"then that it never will, until a man of noble birth and of great wealth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6147",5160,"arise and press the food in the bag with both his feet, saying, ‘Enough","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6148",5160,"has been put therein;’ and I will cause him to go and tread down the food","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6149",5160,"in the bag, and when he does so, turn thou the bag, so that he shall be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6150",5160,"up over his head in it, and then slip a knot upon the thongs of the bag.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6151",5160,"Let there be also a good bugle horn about thy neck, and as soon as thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6152",5160,"hast bound him in the bag, wind thy horn, and let it be a signal between","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6153",5160,"thee and thy knights.  And when they hear the sound of the horn, let them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6154",5160,"come down upon the palace.”  “Lord,” said Gwawl, “it is meet that I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6155",5160,"an answer to my request.”  “As much of that thou hast asked as it is in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6156",5160,"my power to give, thou shalt have,” replied Pwyll.  “My soul,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6157",5160,"Rhiannon unto him, “as for the feast and the banquet that are here, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6158",5160,"have bestowed them upon the men of Dyved, and the household, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6159",5160,"warriors that are with us.  These can I not suffer to be given to any.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6160",5160,"In a year from to-night a banquet shall be prepared for thee in this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6161",5160,"palace, that I may become thy bride.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6162",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6163",5160,"So Gwawl went forth to his possessions, and Pwyll went also back to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6164",5160,"Dyved.  And they both spent that year until it was the time for the feast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6165",5160,"at the palace of Heveydd Hên.  Then Gwawl the son of Clud set out to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6166",5160,"feast that was prepared for him, and he came to the palace, and was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6167",5160,"received there with rejoicing.  Pwyll, also, the Chief of Annwvyn, came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6168",5160,"to the orchard with his hundred knights, as Rhiannon had commanded him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6169",5160,"having the bag with him.  And Pwyll was clad in coarse and ragged","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6170",5160,"garments, and wore large clumsy old shoes upon his feet.  And when he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6171",5160,"knew that the carousal after the meat had begun, he went towards the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6172",5160,"hall, and when he came into the hall, he saluted Gwawl the son of Clud,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6173",5160,"and his company, both men and women.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said Gwawl,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6174",5160,"“and the greeting of Heaven be unto thee.”  “Lord,” said he, “may Heaven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6175",5160,"reward thee, I have an errand unto thee.”  “Welcome be thine errand, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6176",5160,"if thou ask of me that which is just, thou shalt have it gladly.”  “It is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6177",5160,"fitting,” answered he.  “I crave but from want, and the boon that I ask","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6178",5160,"is to have this small bag that thou seest filled with meat.”  “A request","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6179",5160,"within reason is this,” said he, “and gladly shalt thou have it.  Bring","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6180",5160,"him food.”  A great number of attendants arose and began to fill the bag,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6181",5160,"but for all that they put into it, it was no fuller than at first.  “My","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6182",5160,"soul,” said Gwawl, “will thy bag be ever full?”  “It will not, I declare","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6183",5160,"to Heaven,” said he, “for all that may be put into it, unless one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6184",5160,"possessed of lands, and domains, and treasure, shall arise and tread down","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6185",5160,"with both his feet the food that is within the bag, and shall say,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6186",5160,"‘Enough has been put therein.’”  Then said Rhiannon unto Gwawl the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6187",5160,"Clud, “Rise up quickly.”  “I will willingly arise,” said he.  So he rose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6188",5160,"up, and put his two feet into the bag.  And Pwyll turned up the sides of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6189",5160,"the bag, so that Gwawl was over his head in it.  And he shut it up","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6190",5160,"quickly and slipped a knot upon the thongs, and blew his horn.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6191",5160,"thereupon behold his household came down upon the palace.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6192",5160,"seized all the host that had come with Gwawl, and cast them into his own","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6193",5160,"prison.  And Pwyll threw off his rags, and his old shoes, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6194",5160,"tattered array; and as they came in, every one of Pwyll’s knights struck","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6195",5160,"a blow upon the bag, and asked, “What is here?”  “A Badger,” said they.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6196",5160,"And in this manner they played, each of them striking the bag, either","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6197",5160,"with his foot or with a staff.  And thus played they with the bag.  Every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6198",5160,"one as he came in asked, “What game are you playing at thus?”  “The game","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6199",5160,"of Badger in the Bag,” said they.  And then was the game of Badger in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6200",5160,"Bag first played.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6201",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6202",5160,"“Lord,” said the man in the bag, “if thou wouldest but hear me, I merit","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6203",5160,"not to be slain in a bag.”  Said Heveydd Hên, “Lord, he speaks truth.  It","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6204",5160,"were fitting that thou listen to him, for he deserves not this.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6205",5160,"“Verily,” said Pwyll, “I will do thy counsel concerning him.”  “Behold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6206",5160,"this is my counsel then,” said Rhiannon; “thou art now in a position in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6207",5160,"which it behoves thee to satisfy suitors and minstrels; let him give unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6208",5160,"them in thy stead, and take a pledge from him that he will never seek to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6209",5160,"revenge that which has been done to him.  And this will be punishment","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6210",5160,"enough.”  “I will do this gladly,” said the man in the bag.  “And gladly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6211",5160,"will I accept it,” said Pwyll, “since it is the counsel of Heveydd and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6212",5160,"Rhiannon.”  “Such then is our counsel,” answered they.  “I accept it,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6213",5160,"said Pwyll.  “Seek thyself sureties.”  “We will be for him,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6214",5160,"Heveydd, “until his men be free to answer for him.”  And upon this he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6215",5160,"let out of the bag, and his liegemen were liberated.  “Demand now of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6216",5160,"Gwawl his sureties,” said Heveydd, “we know which should be taken for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6217",5160,"him.”  And Heveydd numbered the sureties.  Said Gwawl, “Do thou thyself","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6218",5160,"draw up the covenant.”  “It will suffice me that it be as Rhiannon said,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6219",5160,"answered Pwyll.  So unto that covenant were the sureties pledged.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6220",5160,"“Verily, Lord,” said Gwawl, “I am greatly hurt, and I have many bruises.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6221",5160,"I have need to be anointed; with thy leave I will go forth.  I will leave","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6222",5160,"nobles in my stead, to answer for me in all that thou shalt require.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6223",5160,"“Willingly,” said Pwyll, “mayest thou do thus.”  So Gwawl went towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6224",5160,"his own possessions.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6225",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6226",5160,"And the hall was set in order for Pwyll and the men of his host, and for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6227",5160,"them also of the palace, and they went to the tables and sat down.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6228",5160,"as they had sat that time twelvemonth, so sat they that night.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6229",5160,"ate, and feasted, and spent the night in mirth and tranquillity.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6230",5160,"time came that they should sleep, and Pwyll and Rhiannon went to their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6231",5160,"chamber.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6232",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6233",5160,"And next morning at the break of day, “My Lord,” said Rhiannon, “arise","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6234",5160,"and begin to give thy gifts unto the minstrels.  Refuse no one to-day","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6235",5160,"that may claim thy bounty.”  “Thus shall it be gladly,” said Pwyll, “both","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6236",5160,"to-day and every day while the feast shall last.”  So Pwyll arose, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6237",5160,"caused silence to be proclaimed, and desired all the suitors and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6238",5160,"minstrels to show and to point out what gifts were to their wish and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6239",5160,"desire.  And this being done, the feast went on, and he denied no one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6240",5160,"while it lasted.  And when the feast was ended, Pwyll said unto Heveydd,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6241",5160,"“My Lord, with thy permission I will set out for Dyved to-morrow.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6242",5160,"“Certainly,” said Heveydd, “may Heaven prosper thee.  Fix also a time","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6243",5160,"when Rhiannon may follow thee.”  “By Heaven,” said Pwyll, “we will go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6244",5160,"hence together.”  “Willest thou this, Lord?” said Heveydd.  “Yes, by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6245",5160,"Heaven,” answered Pwyll.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6246",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6247",5160,"And the next day, they set forward towards Dyved, and journeyed to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6248",5160,"palace of Narberth, where a feast was made ready for them.  And there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6249",5160,"came to them great numbers of the chief men and the most noble ladies of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6250",5160,"the land, and of these there was none to whom Rhiannon did not give some","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6251",5160,"rich gift, either a bracelet, or a ring, or a precious stone.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6252",5160,"ruled the land prosperously both that year and the next.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6253",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6254",5160,"And in the third year the nobles of the land began to be sorrowful at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6255",5160,"seeing a man whom they loved so much, and who was moreover their lord and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6256",5160,"their foster-brother, without an heir.  And they came to him.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6257",5160,"place where they met was Preseleu, in Dyved.  “Lord,” said they, “we know","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6258",5160,"that thou art not so young as some of the men of this country, and we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6259",5160,"fear that thou mayest not have an heir of the wife whom thou hast taken.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6260",5160,"Take therefore another wife of whom thou mayest have heirs.  Thou canst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6261",5160,"not always continue with us, and though thou desire to remain as thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6262",5160,"art, we will not suffer thee.”  “Truly,” said Pwyll, “we have not long","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6263",5160,"been joined together, and many things may yet befall.  Grant me a year","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6264",5160,"from this time, and for the space of a year we will abide together, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6265",5160,"after that I will do according to your wishes.”  So they granted it.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6266",5160,"before the end of a year a son was born unto him.  And in Narberth was he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6267",5160,"born; and on the night that he was born, women were brought to watch the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6268",5160,"mother and the boy.  And the women slept, as did also Rhiannon, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6269",5160,"mother of the boy.  And the number of the women that were brought into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6270",5160,"the chamber was six.  And they watched for a good portion of the night,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6271",5160,"and before midnight every one of them fell asleep, and towards break of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6272",5160,"day they awoke; and when they awoke, they looked where they had put the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6273",5160,"boy, and behold he was not there.  “Oh,” said one of the women, “the boy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6274",5160,"is lost?”  “Yes,” said another, “and it will be small vengeance if we are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6275",5160,"burnt or put to death because of the child.”  Said one of the women, “Is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6276",5160,"there any counsel for us in the world in this matter?”  “There is,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6277",5160,"answered another, “I offer you good counsel.”  “What is that?” asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6278",5160,"they.  “There is here a stag-hound bitch, and she has a litter of whelps.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6279",5160,"Let us kill some of the cubs, and rub the blood on the face and hands of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6280",5160,"Rhiannon, and lay the bones before her, and assert that she herself hath","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6281",5160,"devoured her son, and she alone will not be able to gainsay us six.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6282",5160,"according to this counsel it was settled.  And towards morning Rhiannon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6283",5160,"awoke, and she said, “Women, where is my son?”  “Lady,” said they, “ask","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6284",5160,"us not concerning thy son, we have nought but the blows and the bruises","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6285",5160,"we got by struggling with thee, and of a truth we never saw any woman so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6286",5160,"violent as thou, for it was of no avail to contend with thee.  Hast thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6287",5160,"not thyself devoured thy son?  Claim him not therefore of us.”  “For","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6288",5160,"pity’s sake,” said Rhiannon; “the Lord God knows all things.  Charge me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6289",5160,"not falsely.  If you tell me this from fear, I assert before Heaven that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6290",5160,"I will defend you.”  “Truly,” said they, “we would not bring evil on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6291",5160,"ourselves for any one in the world.”  “For pity’s sake,” said Rhiannon,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6292",5160,"“you will receive no evil by telling the truth.”  But for all her words,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6293",5160,"whether fair or harsh, she received but the same answer from the women.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6294",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6295",5160,"And Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn arose, and his household, and his hosts.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6296",5160,"And this occurrence could not be concealed, but the story went forth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6297",5160,"throughout the land, and all the nobles heard it.  Then the nobles came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6298",5160,"to Pwyll, and besought him to put away his wife, because of the great","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6299",5160,"crime which she had done.  But Pwyll answered them, that they had no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6300",5160,"cause wherefore they might ask him to put away his wife, save for her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6301",5160,"having no children.  “But children has she now had, therefore will I not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6302",5160,"put her away; if she has done wrong, let her do penance for it.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6303",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6304",5160,"So Rhiannon sent for the teachers and the wise men, and as she preferred","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6305",5160,"doing penance to contending with the women, she took upon her a penance.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6306",5160,"And the penance that was imposed upon her was, that she should remain in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6307",5160,"that palace of Narberth until the end of seven years, and that she should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6308",5160,"sit every day near unto a horseblock that was without the gate.  And that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6309",5160,"she should relate the story to all who should come there, whom she might","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6310",5160,"suppose not to know it already; and that she should offer the guests and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6311",5160,"strangers, if they would permit her, to carry them upon her back into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6312",5160,"palace.  But it rarely happened that any would permit.  And thus did she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6313",5160,"spend part of the year.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6314",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6315",5160,"Now at that time Teirnyon Twryv Vliant was Lord of Gwent Is Coed, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6316",5160,"was the best man in the world.  And unto his house there belonged a mare,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6317",5160,"than which neither mare nor horse in the kingdom was more beautiful.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6318",5160,"on the night of every first of May she foaled, and no one ever knew what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6319",5160,"became of the colt.  And one night Teirnyon talked with his wife: “Wife,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6320",5160,"said he, “it is very simple of us that our mare should foal every year,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6321",5160,"and that we should have none of her colts.”  “What can be done in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6322",5160,"matter?” said she.  “This is the night of the first of May,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6323",5160,"“The vengeance of Heaven be upon me, if I learn not what it is that takes","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6324",5160,"away the colts.”  So he caused the mare to be brought into a house, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6325",5160,"he armed himself, and began to watch that night.  And in the beginning of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6326",5160,"the night, the mare foaled a large and beautiful colt.  And it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6327",5160,"standing up in the place.  And Teirnyon rose up and looked at the size of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6328",5160,"the colt, and as he did so he heard a great tumult, and after the tumult","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6329",5160,"behold a claw came through the window into the house, and it seized the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6330",5160,"colt by the mane.  Then Teirnyon drew his sword, and struck off the arm","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6331",5160,"at the elbow, so that portion of the arm together with the colt was in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6332",5160,"the house with him.  And then did he hear a tumult and wailing, both at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6333",5160,"once.  And he opened the door, and rushed out in the direction of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6334",5160,"noise, and he could not see the cause of the tumult because of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6335",5160,"darkness of the night, but he rushed after it and followed it.  Then he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6336",5160,"remembered that he had left the door open, and he returned.  And at the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6337",5160,"door behold there was an infant boy in swaddling-clothes, wrapped around","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6338",5160,"in a mantle of satin.  And he took up the boy, and behold he was very","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6339",5160,"strong for the age that he was of.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6340",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6341",5160,"Then he shut the door, and went into the chamber where his wife was.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6342",5160,"“Lady,” said he, “art thou sleeping?”  “No, lord,” said she, “I was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6343",5160,"asleep, but as thou camest in I did awake.”  “Behold, here is a boy for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6344",5160,"thee if thou wilt,” said he, “since thou hast never had one.”  “My lord,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6345",5160,"said she, “what adventure is this?”  “It was thus,” said Teirnyon; and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6346",5160,"told her how it all befell.  “Verily, lord,” said she, “what sort of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6347",5160,"garments are there upon the boy?”  “A mantle of satin,” said he.  “He is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6348",5160,"then a boy of gentle lineage,” she replied.  “My lord,” she said, “if","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6349",5160,"thou wilt, I shall have great diversion and mirth.  I will call my women","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6350",5160,"unto me, and tell them that I have been pregnant.”  “I will readily grant","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6351",5160,"thee to do this,” he answered.  And thus did they, and they caused the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6352",5160,"boy to be baptized, and the ceremony was performed there; and the name","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6353",5160,"which they gave unto him was Gwri Wallt Euryn, because what hair was upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6354",5160,"his head was as yellow as gold.  And they had the boy nursed in the Court","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6355",5160,"until he was a year old.  And before the year was over he could walk","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6356",5160,"stoutly.  And he was larger than a boy of three years old, even one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6357",5160,"great growth and size.  And the boy was nursed the second year, and then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6358",5160,"he was as large as a child six years old.  And before the end of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6359",5160,"fourth year, he would bribe the grooms to allow him to take the horses to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6360",5160,"water.  “My lord,” said his wife unto Teirnyon, “where is the colt which","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6361",5160,"thou didst save on the night that thou didst find the boy?”  “I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6362",5160,"commanded the grooms of the horses,” said he, “that they take care of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6363",5160,"him.”  “Would it not be well, lord,” said she, “if thou wert to cause him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6364",5160,"to be broken in, and given to the boy, seeing that on the same night that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6365",5160,"thou didst find the boy, the colt was foaled and thou didst save him?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6366",5160,"“I will not oppose thee in this matter,” said Teirnyon.  “I will allow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6367",5160,"thee to give him the colt.”  “Lord,” said she, “may Heaven reward thee; I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6368",5160,"will give it him.”  So the horse was given to the boy.  Then she went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6369",5160,"the grooms and those who tended the horses, and commanded them to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6370",5160,"careful of the horse, so that he might be broken in by the time that the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6371",5160,"boy could ride him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6372",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6373",5160,"And while these things were going forward, they heard tidings of Rhiannon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6374",5160,"and her punishment.  And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant, by reason of the pity","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6375",5160,"that he felt on hearing this story of Rhiannon and her punishment,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6376",5160,"inquired closely concerning it, until he had heard from many of those who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6377",5160,"came to his court.  Then did Teirnyon, often lamenting the sad history,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6378",5160,"ponder within himself, and he looked steadfastly on the boy, and as he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6379",5160,"looked upon him, it seemed to him that he had never beheld so great a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6380",5160,"likeness between father and son, as between the boy and Pwyll the Chief","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6381",5160,"of Annwvyn.  Now the semblance of Pwyll was well known to him, for he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6382",5160,"of yore been one of his followers.  And thereupon he became grieved for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6383",5160,"the wrong that he did, in keeping with him a boy whom he knew to be the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6384",5160,"son of another man.  And the first time that he was alone with his wife,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6385",5160,"he told her that it was not right that they should keep the boy with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6386",5160,"them, and suffer so excellent a lady as Rhiannon to be punished so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6387",5160,"greatly on his account, whereas the boy was the son of Pwyll the Chief of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6388",5160,"Annwvyn.  And Teirnyon’s wife agreed with him, that they should send the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6389",5160,"boy to Pwyll.  “And three things, lord,” said she, “shall we gain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6390",5160,"thereby.  Thanks and gifts for releasing Rhiannon from her punishment;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6391",5160,"and thanks from Pwyll for nursing his son and restoring him unto him; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6392",5160,"thirdly, if the boy is of gentle nature, he will be our foster-son, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6393",5160,"he will do for us all the good in his power.”  So it was settled","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6394",5160,"according to this counsel.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6395",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6396",5160,"And no later than the next day was Teirnyon equipped, and two other","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6397",5160,"knights with him.  And the boy, as a fourth in their company, went with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6398",5160,"them upon the horse which Teirnyon had given him.  And they journeyed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6399",5160,"towards Narberth, and it was not long before they reached that place.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6400",5160,"And as they drew near to the palace, they beheld Rhiannon sitting beside","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6401",5160,"the horseblock.  And when they were opposite to her, “Chieftain,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6402",5160,"she, “go not further thus, I will bear every one of you into the palace,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6403",5160,"and this is my penance for slaying my own son and devouring him.”  “Oh,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6404",5160,"fair lady,” said Teirnyon, “think not that I will be one to be carried","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6405",5160,"upon thy back.”  “Neither will I,” said the boy.  “Truly, my soul,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6406",5160,"Teirnyon, “we will not go.”  So they went forward to the palace, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6407",5160,"there was great joy at their coming.  And at the palace a feast was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6408",5160,"prepared, because Pywll was come back from the confines of Dyved.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6409",5160,"they went into the hall and washed, and Pwyll rejoiced to see Teirnyon.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6410",5160,"And in this order they sat.  Teirnyon between Pwyll and Rhiannon, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6411",5160,"Teirnyon’s two companions on the other side of Pwyll, with the boy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6412",5160,"between them.  And after meat they began to carouse and to discourse.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6413",5160,"And Teirnyon’s discourse was concerning the adventure of the mare and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6414",5160,"boy, and how he and his wife had nursed and reared the child as their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6415",5160,"own.  “And behold here is thy son, lady,” said Teirnyon.  “And whosoever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6416",5160,"told that lie concerning thee, has done wrong.  And when I heard of thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6417",5160,"sorrow, I was troubled and grieved.  And I believe that there is none of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6418",5160,"this host who will not perceive that the boy is the son of Pwyll,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6419",5160,"Teirnyon.  “There is none,” said they all, “who is not certain thereof.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6420",5160,"“I declare to Heaven,” said Rhiannon, “that if this be true, there is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6421",5160,"indeed an end to my trouble.”  “Lady,” said Pendaran Dyved, “well hast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6422",5160,"thou named thy son Pryderi, {3} and well becomes him the name of Pryderi","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6423",5160,"son of Pwyll Chief of Annwvyn.”  “Look you,” said Rhiannon, “will not his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6424",5160,"own name become him better?”  “What name has he?” asked Pendaran Dyved.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6425",5160,"“Gwri Wallt Euryn is the name that we gave him.”  “Pryderi,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6426",5160,"Pendaran, “shall his name be.”  “It were more proper,” said Pwyll, “that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6427",5160,"the boy should take his name from the word his mother spoke when she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6428",5160,"received the joyful tidings of him.”  And thus was it arranged.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6429",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6430",5160,"“Teirnyon,” said Pwyll, “Heaven reward thee that thou hast reared the boy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6431",5160,"up to this time, and, being of gentle lineage, it were fitting that he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6432",5160,"repay thee for it.”  “My lord,” said Teirnyon, “it was my wife who nursed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6433",5160,"him, and there is no one in the world so afflicted as she at parting with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6434",5160,"him.  It were well that he should bear in mind what I and my wife have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6435",5160,"done for him.”  “I call Heaven to witness,” said Pwyll, “that while I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6436",5160,"live I will support thee and thy possessions, as long as I am able to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6437",5160,"preserve my own.  And when he shall have power, he will more fitly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6438",5160,"maintain them than I.  And if this counsel be pleasing unto thee, and to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6439",5160,"my nobles, it shall be that, as thou hast reared him up to the present","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6440",5160,"time, I will give him to be brought up by Pendaran Dyved, from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6441",5160,"henceforth.  And you shall be companions, and shall both be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6442",5160,"foster-fathers unto him.”  “This is good counsel,” said they all.  So the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6443",5160,"boy was given to Pendaran Dyved, and the nobles of the land were sent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6444",5160,"with him.  And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant, and his companions, set out for his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6445",5160,"country, and his possessions, with love and gladness.  And he went not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6446",5160,"without being offered the fairest jewels and the fairest horses, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6447",5160,"choicest dogs; but he would take none of them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6448",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6449",5160,"Thereupon they all remained in their own dominions.  And Pryderi, the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6450",5160,"of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn, was brought up carefully as was fit, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6451",5160,"that he became the fairest youth, and the most comely, and the best","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6452",5160,"skilled in all good games, of any in the kingdom.  And thus passed years","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6453",5160,"and years, until the end of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn’s life came, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6454",5160,"he died.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6455",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6456",5160,"And Pryderi ruled the seven Cantrevs of Dyved prosperously, and he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6457",5160,"beloved by his people, and by all around him.  And at length he added","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6458",5160,"unto them the three Cantrevs of Ystrad Tywi, and the four Cantrevs of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6459",5160,"Cardigan; and these were called the Seven Cantrevs of Seissyllwch.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6460",5160,"when he made this addition, Pryderi the son of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6461",5160,"desired to take a wife.  And the wife he chose was Kicva, the daughter of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6462",5160,"Gwynn Gohoyw, the son of Gloyw Wallt Lydan, the son of Prince Casnar, one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6464",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6473",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6474",5160,"BENDIGEID VRAN, the son of Llyr, was the crowned king of this island, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6475",5160,"he was exalted from the crown of London.  And one afternoon he was at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6476",5160,"Harlech in Ardudwy, at his Court, and he sat upon the rock of Harlech,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6477",5160,"looking over the sea.  And with him were his brother Manawyddan the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6478",5160,"of Llyr, and his brothers by the mother’s side, Nissyen and Evnissyen,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6479",5160,"and many nobles likewise, as was fitting to see around a king.  His two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6480",5160,"brothers by the mother’s side were the sons of Eurosswydd, by his mother,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6481",5160,"Penardun, the daughter of Beli son of Manogan.  And one of these youths","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6482",5160,"was a good youth and of gentle nature, and would make peace between his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6483",5160,"kindred, and cause his family to be friends when their wrath was at the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6484",5160,"highest; and this one was Nissyen; but the other would cause strife","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6485",5160,"between his two brothers when they were most at peace.  And as they sat","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6486",5160,"thus, they beheld thirteen ships coming from the south of Ireland, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6487",5160,"making towards them, and they came with a swift motion, the wind being","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6488",5160,"behind them, and they neared them rapidly.  “I see ships afar,” said the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6489",5160,"king, “coming swiftly towards the land.  Command the men of the Court","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6490",5160,"that they equip themselves, and go and learn their intent.”  So the men","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6491",5160,"equipped themselves and went down towards them.  And when they saw the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6492",5160,"ships near, certain were they that they had never seen ships better","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6493",5160,"furnished.  Beautiful flags of satin were upon them.  And behold one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6494",5160,"the ships outstripped the others, and they saw a shield lifted up above","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6495",5160,"the side of the ship, and the point of the shield was upwards, in token","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6496",5160,"of peace.  And the men drew near that they might hold converse.  Then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6497",5160,"they put out boats and came towards the land.  And they saluted the king.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6498",5160,"Now the king could hear them from the place where he was, upon the rock","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6499",5160,"above their heads.  “Heaven prosper you,” said he, “and be ye welcome.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6500",5160,"To whom do these ships belong, and who is the chief amongst you?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6501",5160,"“Lord,” said they, “Matholwch, king of Ireland, is here, and these ships","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6502",5160,"belong to him.”  “Wherefore comes he?” asked the king, “and will he come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6503",5160,"to the land?”  “He is a suitor unto thee, lord,” said they, “and he will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6504",5160,"not land unless he have his boon.”  “And what may that be?” inquired the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6505",5160,"king.  “He desires to ally himself with thee, lord,” said they, “and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6506",5160,"comes to ask Branwen the daughter of Llyr, that, if it seem well to thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6507",5160,"the Island of the Mighty may be leagued with Ireland, and both become","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6508",5160,"more powerful.”  “Verily,” said he, “let him come to land, and we will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6509",5160,"take counsel thereupon.”  And this answer was brought to Matholwch.  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6510",5160,"will go willingly,” said he.  So he landed, and they received him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6511",5160,"joyfully; and great was the throng in the palace that night, between his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6512",5160,"hosts and those of the Court; and next day they took counsel, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6513",5160,"resolved to bestow Branwen upon Matholwch.  Now she was one of the three","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6514",5160,"chief ladies of this island, and she was the fairest damsel in the world.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6515",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6516",5160,"And they fixed upon Aberffraw as the place where she should become his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6517",5160,"bride.  And they went thence, and towards Aberffraw the hosts proceeded;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6518",5160,"Matholwch and his host in their ships; Bendigeid Vran and his host by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6519",5160,"land, until they came to Aberffraw.  And at Aberffraw they began the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6520",5160,"feast and sat down.  And thus sat they.  The King of the Island of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6521",5160,"Mighty and Manawyddan the son of Llyr on one side, and Matholwch on the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6522",5160,"other side, and Branwen the daughter of Llyr beside him.  And they were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6523",5160,"not within a house, but under tents.  No house could ever contain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6524",5160,"Bendigeid Vran.  And they began the banquet and caroused and discoursed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6525",5160,"And when it was more pleasing to them to sleep than to carouse, they went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6526",5160,"to rest, and that night Branwen became Matholwch’s bride.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6527",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6528",5160,"And next day they arose, and all they of the Court, and the officers","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6529",5160,"began to equip and to range the horses and the attendants, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6530",5160,"ranged them in order as far as the sea.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6531",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6532",5160,"And behold one day, Evnissyen, the quarrelsome man of whom it is spoken","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6533",5160,"above, came by chance into the place, where the horses of Matholwch were,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6534",5160,"and asked whose horses they might be.  “They are the horses of Matholwch","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6535",5160,"king of Ireland, who is married to Branwen, thy sister; his horses are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6536",5160,"they.”  “And is it thus they have done with a maiden such as she, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6537",5160,"moreover my sister, bestowing her without my consent?  They could have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6538",5160,"offered no greater insult to me than this,” said he.  And thereupon he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6539",5160,"rushed under the horses and cut off their lips at the teeth, and their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6540",5160,"ears close to their heads, and their tails close to their backs, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6541",5160,"wherever he could clutch their eyelids, he cut them to the very bone, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6542",5160,"he disfigured the horses and rendered them useless.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6543",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6544",5160,"And they came with these tidings unto Matholwch, saying that the horses","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6545",5160,"were disfigured, and injured so that not one of them could ever be of any","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6546",5160,"use again.  “Verily, lord,” said one, “it was an insult unto thee, and as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6547",5160,"such was it meant.”  “Of a truth, it is a marvel to me, that if they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6548",5160,"desire to insult me, they should have given me a maiden of such high rank","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6549",5160,"and so much beloved of her kindred, as they have done.”  “Lord,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6550",5160,"another, “thou seest that thus it is, and there is nothing for thee to do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6551",5160,"but to go to thy ships.”  And thereupon towards his ships he set out.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6552",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6553",5160,"And tidings came to Bendigeid Vran that Matholwch was quitting the Court","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6554",5160,"without asking leave, and messengers were sent to inquire of him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6555",5160,"wherefore he did so.  And the messengers that went were Iddic the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6556",5160,"Anarawd, and Heveydd Hir.  And these overtook him and asked of him what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6557",5160,"he designed to do, and wherefore he went forth.  “Of a truth,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6558",5160,"“if I had known I had not come hither.  I have been altogether insulted,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6559",5160,"no one had ever worse treatment than I have had here.  But one thing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6560",5160,"surprises me above all.”  “What is that?” asked they.  “That Branwen the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6561",5160,"daughter of Llyr, one of the three chief ladies of this island, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6562",5160,"daughter of the King of the Island of the Mighty, should have been given","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6563",5160,"me as my bride, and that after that I should have been insulted; and I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6564",5160,"marvel that the insult was not done me before they had bestowed upon me a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6565",5160,"maiden so exalted as she.”  “Truly, lord, it was not the will of any that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6566",5160,"are of the Court,” said they, “nor of any that are of the council, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6567",5160,"thou shouldest have received this insult; and as thou hast been insulted,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6568",5160,"the dishonour is greater unto Bendigeid Vran than unto thee.”  “Verily,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6569",5160,"said he, “I think so.  Nevertheless he cannot recall the insult.”  These","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6570",5160,"men returned with that answer to the place where Bendigeid Vran was, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6571",5160,"they told him what reply Matholwch had given them.  “Truly,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6572",5160,"“there are no means by which we may prevent his going away at enmity with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6573",5160,"us, that we will not take.”  “Well, lord,” said they, “send after him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6574",5160,"another embassy.”  “I will do so,” said he.  “Arise, Manawyddan son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6575",5160,"Llyr, and Heveydd Hir, and Unic Glew Ysgwyd, and go after him, and tell","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6576",5160,"him that he shall have a sound horse for every one that has been injured.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6577",5160,"And beside that, as an atonement for the insult, he shall have a staff of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6578",5160,"silver, as large and as tall as himself, and a plate of gold of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6579",5160,"breadth of his face.  And show unto him who it was that did this, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6580",5160,"that it was done against my will; but that he who did it is my brother,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6581",5160,"by the mother’s side, and therefore it would be hard for me to put him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6582",5160,"death.  And let him come and meet me,” said he, “and we will make peace","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6583",5160,"in any way he may desire.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6584",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6585",5160,"The embassy went after Matholwch, and told him all these sayings in a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6586",5160,"friendly manner, and he listened thereunto.  “Men,” said he, “I will take","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6587",5160,"counsel.”  So to the council he went.  And in the council they considered","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6588",5160,"that if they should refuse this, they were likely to have more shame","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6589",5160,"rather than to obtain so great an atonement.  They resolved therefore to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6590",5160,"accept it, and they returned to the Court in peace.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6591",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6592",5160,"Then the pavilions and the tents were set in order after the fashion of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6593",5160,"hall; and they went to meat, and as they had sat at the beginning of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6594",5160,"feast, so sat they there.  And Matholwch and Bendigeid Vran began to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6595",5160,"discourse; and behold it seemed to Bendigeid Vran, while they talked,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6596",5160,"that Matholwch was not so cheerful as he had been before.  And he thought","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6597",5160,"that the chieftain might be sad, because of the smallness of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6598",5160,"atonement which he had, for the wrong that had been done him.  “Oh, man,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6599",5160,"said Bendigeid Vran, “thou dost not discourse to-night so cheerfully as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6600",5160,"thou wast wont.  And if it be because of the smallness of the atonement,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6601",5160,"thou shalt add thereunto whatsoever thou mayest choose, and to-morrow I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6602",5160,"will pay thee the horses.”  “Lord,” said he, “Heaven reward thee.”  “And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6603",5160,"I will enhance the atonement,” said Bendigeid Vran, “for I will give unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6604",5160,"thee a cauldron, the property of which is, that if one of thy men be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6605",5160,"slain to-day, and be cast therein, to-morrow he will be as well as ever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6606",5160,"he was at the best, except that he will not regain his speech.”  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6607",5160,"thereupon he gave him great thanks, and very joyful was he for that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6608",5160,"cause.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6609",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6610",5160,"And the next morning they paid Matholwch the horses as long as the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6611",5160,"trained horses lasted.  And then they journeyed into another commot,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6612",5160,"where they paid him with colts until the whole had been paid, and from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6613",5160,"thenceforth that commot was called Talebolion.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6614",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6615",5160,"And a second night sat they together.  “My lord,” said Matholwch, “whence","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6616",5160,"hadst thou the cauldron which thou hast given me?”  “I had it of a man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6617",5160,"who had been in thy land,” said he, “and I would not give it except to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6618",5160,"one from there.”  “Who was it?” asked he.  “Llassar Llaesgyvnewid; he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6619",5160,"came here from Ireland with Kymideu Kymeinvoll, his wife, who escaped","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6620",5160,"from the Iron House in Ireland, when it was made red hot around them, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6621",5160,"fled hither.  And it is a marvel to me that thou shouldst know nothing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6622",5160,"concerning the matter.”  “Something I do know,” said he, “and as much as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6623",5160,"I know I will tell thee.  One day I was hunting in Ireland, and I came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6624",5160,"the mound at the head of the lake, which is called the Lake of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6625",5160,"Cauldron.  And I beheld a huge yellow-haired man coming from the lake","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6626",5160,"with a cauldron upon his back.  And he was a man of vast size, and of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6627",5160,"horrid aspect, and a woman followed after him.  And if the man was tall,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6628",5160,"twice as large as he was the woman, and they came towards me and greeted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6629",5160,"me.  ‘Verily,’ asked I, ‘wherefore are you journeying?’  ‘Behold, this,’","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6630",5160,"said he to me, ‘is the cause that we journey.  At the end of a month and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6631",5160,"a fortnight this woman will have a son; and the child that will be born","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6632",5160,"at the end of the month and the fortnight will be a warrior fully armed.’","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6633",5160,"So I took them with me and maintained them.  And they were with me for a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6634",5160,"year.  And that year I had them with me not grudgingly.  But thenceforth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6635",5160,"was there murmuring, because that they were with me.  For, from the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6636",5160,"beginning of the fourth month they had begun to make themselves hated and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6637",5160,"to be disorderly in the land; committing outrages, and molesting and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6638",5160,"harassing the nobles and ladies; and thenceforward my people rose up and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6639",5160,"besought me to part with them, and they bade me to choose between them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6640",5160,"and my dominions.  And I applied to the council of my country to know","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6641",5160,"what should be done concerning them; for of their own free will they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6642",5160,"would not go, neither could they be compelled against their will, through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6643",5160,"fighting.  And [the people of the country] being in this strait, they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6644",5160,"caused a chamber to be made all of iron.  Now when the chamber was ready,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6645",5160,"there came there every smith that was in Ireland, and every one who owned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6646",5160,"tongs and hammer.  And they caused coals to be piled up as high as the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6647",5160,"top of the chamber.  And they had the man, and the woman, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6648",5160,"children, served with plenty of meat and drink; but when it was known","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6649",5160,"that they were drunk, they began to put fire to the coals about the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6650",5160,"chamber, and they blew it with bellows until the house was red hot all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6651",5160,"around them.  Then was there a council held in the centre of the floor of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6652",5160,"the chamber.  And the man tarried until the plates of iron were all of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6653",5160,"white heat; and then, by reason of the great heat, the man dashed against","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6654",5160,"the plates with his shoulder and struck them out, and his wife followed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6655",5160,"him; but except him and his wife none escaped thence.  And then I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6656",5160,"suppose, lord,” said Matholwch unto Bendigeid Vran, “that he came over","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6657",5160,"unto thee.”  “Doubtless he came here,” said he, “and gave unto me the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6658",5160,"cauldron.”  “In what manner didst thou receive them?”  “I dispersed them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6659",5160,"through every part of my dominions, and they have become numerous and are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6660",5160,"prospering everywhere, and they fortify the places where they are with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6661",5160,"men and arms, of the best that were ever seen.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6662",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6663",5160,"That night they continued to discourse as much as they would, and had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6664",5160,"minstrelsy and carousing, and when it was more pleasant to them to sleep","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6665",5160,"than to sit longer, they went to rest.  And thus was the banquet carried","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6666",5160,"on with joyousness; and when it was finished, Matholwch journeyed towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6667",5160,"Ireland, and Branwen with him, and they went from Aber Menei with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6668",5160,"thirteen ships, and came to Ireland.  And in Ireland was there great joy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6669",5160,"because of their coming.  And not one great man or noble lady visited","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6670",5160,"Branwen unto whom she gave not either a clasp, or a ring, or a royal","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6671",5160,"jewel to keep, such as it was honourable to be seen departing with.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6672",5160,"in these things she spent that year in much renown, and she passed her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6673",5160,"time pleasantly, enjoying honour and friendship.  And in the meanwhile it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6674",5160,"chanced that she became pregnant, and in due time a son was born unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6675",5160,"her, and the name that they gave him was Gwern the son of Matholwch, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6676",5160,"they put the boy out to be foster-nursed, in a place where were the best","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6677",5160,"men of Ireland.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6678",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6679",5160,"And behold in the second year a tumult arose in Ireland, on account of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6680",5160,"the insult which Matholwch had received in Cambria, and the payment made","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6681",5160,"him for his horses.  And his foster-brothers, and such as were nearest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6682",5160,"unto him, blamed him openly for that matter.  And he might have no peace","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6683",5160,"by reason of the tumult until they should revenge upon him this disgrace.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6684",5160,"And the vengeance which they took was to drive away Branwen from the same","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6685",5160,"chamber with him, and to make her cook for the Court; and they caused the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6686",5160,"butcher after he had cut up the meat to come to her and give her every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6687",5160,"day a blow on the ear, and such they made her punishment.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6688",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6689",5160,"“Verily, lord,” said his men to Matholwch, “forbid now the ships and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6690",5160,"ferry boats and the coracles, that they go not into Cambria, and such as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6691",5160,"come over from Cambria hither, imprison them that they go not back for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6692",5160,"this thing to be known there.”  And he did so; and it was thus for not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6693",5160,"less than three years.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6694",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6695",5160,"And Branwen reared a starling in the cover of the kneading trough, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6696",5160,"she taught it to speak, and she taught the bird what manner of man her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6697",5160,"brother was.  And she wrote a letter of her woes, and the despite with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6698",5160,"which she was treated, and she bound the letter to the root of the bird’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6699",5160,"wing, and sent it towards Britain.  And the bird came to this island, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6700",5160,"one day it found Bendigeid Vran at Caer Seiont in Arvon, conferring","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6701",5160,"there, and it alighted upon his shoulder and ruffled its feathers, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6702",5160,"that the letter was seen, and they knew that the bird had been reared in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6703",5160,"a domestic manner.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6704",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6705",5160,"Then Bendigeid Vran took the letter and looked upon it.  And when he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6706",5160,"read the letter he grieved exceedingly at the tidings of Branwen’s woes.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6707",5160,"And immediately he began sending messengers to summon the island","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6708",5160,"together.  And he caused sevenscore and four countries to come unto him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6709",5160,"and he complained to them himself of the grief that his sister endured.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6710",5160,"So they took counsel.  And in the council they resolved to go to Ireland,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6711",5160,"and to leave seven men as princes here, and Caradawc, the son of Bran, as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6712",5160,"the chief of them, and their seven knights.  In Edeyrnion were these men","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6713",5160,"left.  And for this reason were the seven knights placed in the town.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6714",5160,"Now the names of these seven men were, Caradawc the son of Bran, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6715",5160,"Heveydd Hir, and Unic Glew Ysgwyd, and Iddic the son of Anarawc","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6716",5160,"Gwalltgrwn, and Fodor the son of Ervyll, and Gwlch Minascwrn, and Llassar","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6717",5160,"the son of Llaesar Llaesgygwyd, and Pendaran Dyved as a young page with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6718",5160,"them.  And these abode as seven ministers to take charge of this island;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6719",5160,"and Caradawc the son of Bran was the chief amongst them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6720",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6721",5160,"Bendigeid Vran, with the host of which we spoke, sailed towards Ireland,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6722",5160,"and it was not far across the sea, and he came to shoal water.  It was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6723",5160,"caused by two rivers; the Lli and the Archan were they called; and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6724",5160,"nations covered the sea.  Then he proceeded with what provisions he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6725",5160,"on his own back, and approached the shore of Ireland.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6726",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6727",5160,"Now the swineherds of Matholwch were upon the seashore, and they came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6728",5160,"Matholwch.  “Lord,” said they, “greeting be unto thee.”  “Heaven protect","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6729",5160,"you,” said he, “have you any news?”  “Lord,” said they, “we have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6730",5160,"marvellous news, a wood have we seen upon the sea, in a place where we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6731",5160,"never yet saw a single tree.”  “This is indeed a marvel,” said he; “saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6732",5160,"you aught else?”  “We saw, lord,” said they, “a vast mountain beside the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6733",5160,"wood, which moved, and there was a lofty ridge on the top of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6734",5160,"mountain, and a lake on each side of the ridge.  And the wood, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6735",5160,"mountain, and all these things moved.”  “Verily,” said he, “there is none","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6736",5160,"who can know aught concerning this, unless it be Branwen.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6737",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6738",5160,"Messengers then went unto Branwen.  “Lady,” said they, “what thinkest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6739",5160,"thou that this is?”  “The men of the Island of the Mighty, who have come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6740",5160,"hither on hearing of my ill-treatment and my woes.”  “What is the forest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6741",5160,"that is seen upon the sea?” asked they.  “The yards and the masts of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6742",5160,"ships,” she answered.  “Alas,” said they, “what is the mountain that is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6743",5160,"seen by the side of the ships?”  “Bendigeid Vran, my brother,” she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6744",5160,"replied, “coming to shoal water; there is no ship that can contain him in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6745",5160,"it.”  “What is the lofty ridge with the lake on each side thereof?”  “On","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6746",5160,"looking towards this island he is wroth, and his two eyes, one on each","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6747",5160,"side of his nose, are the two lakes beside the ridge.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6748",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6749",5160,"The warriors and the chief men of Ireland were brought together in haste,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6750",5160,"and they took counsel.  “Lord,” said the nobles unto Matholwch, “there is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6751",5160,"no other counsel than to retreat over the Linon (a river which is in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6752",5160,"Ireland), and to keep the river between thee and him, and to break down","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6753",5160,"the bridge that is across the river, for there is a loadstone at the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6754",5160,"bottom of the river that neither ship nor vessel can pass over.”  So they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6755",5160,"retreated across the river, and broke down the bridge.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6756",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6757",5160,"Bendigeid Vran came to land, and the fleet with him by the bank of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6758",5160,"river.  “Lord,” said his chieftains, “knowest thou the nature of this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6759",5160,"river, that nothing can go across it, and there is no bridge over it?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6760",5160,"“What,” said they, “is thy counsel concerning a bridge?”  “There is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6761",5160,"none,” said he, “except that he who will be chief, let him be a bridge.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6762",5160,"I will be so,” said he.  And then was that saying first uttered, and it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6763",5160,"is still used as a proverb.  And when he had lain down across the river,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6764",5160,"hurdles were placed upon him, and the host passed over thereby.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6765",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6766",5160,"And as he rose up, behold the messengers of Matholwch came to him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6767",5160,"saluted him, and gave him greeting in the name of Matholwch, his kinsman,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6768",5160,"and showed how that of his goodwill he had merited of him nothing but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6769",5160,"good.  “For Matholwch has given the kingdom of Ireland to Gwern the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6770",5160,"of Matholwch, thy nephew and thy sister’s son.  And this he places before","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6771",5160,"thee, as a compensation for the wrong and despite that has been done unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6772",5160,"Branwen.  And Matholwch shall be maintained wheresoever thou wilt, either","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6773",5160,"here or in the Island of the Mighty.”  Said Bendigeid Vran, “Shall not I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6774",5160,"myself have the kingdom?  Then peradventure I may take counsel concerning","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6775",5160,"your message.  From this time until then no other answer will you get","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6776",5160,"from me.”  “Verily,” said they, “the best message that we receive for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6777",5160,"thee, we will convey it unto thee, and do thou await our message unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6779",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6780",5160,"The messengers set forth and came to Matholwch.  “Lord,” said they,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6781",5160,"“prepare a better message for Bendigeid Vran.  He would not listen at all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6782",5160,"to the message that we bore him.”  “My friends,” said Matholwch, “what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6783",5160,"may be your counsel?”  “Lord,” said they, “there is no other counsel than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6784",5160,"this alone.  He was never known to be within a house, make therefore a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6785",5160,"house that will contain him and the men of the Island of the Mighty on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6786",5160,"the one side, and thyself and thy host on the other; and give over thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6787",5160,"kingdom to his will, and do him homage.  So by reason of the honour thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6788",5160,"doest him in making him a house, whereas he never before had a house to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6789",5160,"contain him, he will make peace with thee.”  So the messengers went back","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6790",5160,"to Bendigeid Vran, bearing him this message.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6791",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6792",5160,"And he took counsel, and in the council it was resolved that he should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6793",5160,"accept this, and this was all done by the advice of Branwen, and lest the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6794",5160,"country should be destroyed.  And this peace was made, and the house was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6795",5160,"built both vast and strong.  But the Irish planned a crafty device, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6796",5160,"the craft was that they should put brackets on each side of the hundred","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6797",5160,"pillars that were in the house, and should place a leathern bag on each","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6798",5160,"bracket, and an armed man in every one of them.  Then Evnissyen came in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6799",5160,"before the host of the Island of the Mighty, and scanned the house with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6800",5160,"fierce and savage looks, and descried the leathern bags which were around","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6801",5160,"the pillars.  “What is in this bag?” asked he of one of the Irish.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6802",5160,"“Meal, good soul,” said he.  And Evnissyen felt about it until he came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6803",5160,"the man’s head, and he squeezed the head until he felt his fingers meet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6804",5160,"together in the brain through the bone.  And he left that one and put his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6805",5160,"hand upon another, and asked what was therein.  “Meal,” said the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6806",5160,"Irishman.  So he did the like unto every one of them, until he had not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6807",5160,"left alive, of all the two hundred men, save one only; and when he came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6808",5160,"to him, he asked what was there.  “Meal, good soul,” said the Irishman.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6809",5160,"And he felt about until he felt the head, and he squeezed that head as he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6810",5160,"had done the others.  And, albeit he found that the head of this one was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6811",5160,"armed, he left him not until he had killed him.  And then he sang an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6817",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6818",5160,"Thereupon came the hosts unto the house.  The men of the Island of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6819",5160,"Ireland entered the house on the one side, and the men of the Island of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6820",5160,"the Mighty on the other.  And as soon as they had sat down there was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6821",5160,"concord between them; and the sovereignty was conferred upon the boy.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6822",5160,"When the peace was concluded, Bendigeid Vran called the boy unto him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6823",5160,"from Bendigeid Vran the boy went unto Manawyddan, and he was beloved by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6824",5160,"all that beheld him.  And from Manawyddan the boy was called by Nissyen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6825",5160,"the son of Eurosswydd, and the boy went unto him lovingly.  “Wherefore,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6826",5160,"said Evnissyen, “comes not my nephew the son of my sister unto me?","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6827",5160,"Though he were not king of Ireland, yet willingly would I fondle the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6828",5160,"boy.”  “Cheerfully let him go to thee,” said Bendigeid Vran, and the boy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6829",5160,"went unto him cheerfully.  “By my confession to Heaven,” said Evnissyen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6830",5160,"in his heart, “unthought of by the household is the slaughter that I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6831",5160,"this instant commit.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6832",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6833",5160,"Then he arose and took up the boy by the feet, and before any one in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6834",5160,"house could seize hold of him, he thrust the boy headlong into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6835",5160,"blazing fire.  And when Branwen saw her son burning in the fire, she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6836",5160,"strove to leap into the fire also, from the place where she sat between","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6837",5160,"her two brothers.  But Bendigeid Vran grasped her with one hand, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6838",5160,"shield with the other.  Then they all hurried about the house, and never","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6839",5160,"was there made so great a tumult by any host in one house as was made by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6840",5160,"them, as each man armed himself.  Then said Morddwydtyllyon, “The","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6841",5160,"gadflies of Morddwydtyllyon’s Cow!”  And while they all sought their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6842",5160,"arms, Bendigeid Vran supported Branwen between his shield and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6843",5160,"shoulder.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6844",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6845",5160,"Then the Irish kindled a fire under the cauldron of renovation, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6846",5160,"cast the dead bodies into the cauldron until it was full, and the next","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6847",5160,"day they came forth fighting-men as good as before, except that they were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6848",5160,"not able to speak.  Then when Evnissyen saw the dead bodies of the men of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6849",5160,"the Island of the Mighty nowhere resuscitated, he said in his heart,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6850",5160,"“Alas! woe is me, that I should have been the cause of bringing the men","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6851",5160,"of the Island of the Mighty into so great a strait.  Evil betide me if I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6852",5160,"find not a deliverance therefrom.”  And he cast himself among the dead","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6853",5160,"bodies of the Irish, and two unshod Irishmen came to him, and, taking him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6854",5160,"to be one of the Irish, flung him into the cauldron.  And he stretched","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6855",5160,"himself out in the cauldron, so that he rent the cauldron into four","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6856",5160,"pieces, and burst his own heart also.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6857",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6858",5160,"In consequence of that the men of the Island of the Mighty obtained such","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6859",5160,"success as they had; but they were not victorious, for only seven men of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6860",5160,"them all escaped, and Bendigeid Vran himself was wounded in the foot with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6861",5160,"a poisoned dart.  Now the seven men that escaped were Pryderi,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6862",5160,"Manawyddan, Gluneu Eil Taran, Taliesin, Ynawc, Grudyen the son of Muryel,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6864",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6865",5160,"And Bendigeid Vran commanded them that they should cut off his head.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6866",5160,"“And take you my head,” said he, “and bear it even unto the White Mount,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6867",5160,"in London, and bury it there, with the face towards France.  And a long","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6868",5160,"time will you be upon the road.  In Harlech you will be feasting seven","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6869",5160,"years, the birds of Rhiannon singing unto you the while.  And all that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6870",5160,"time the head will be to you as pleasant company as it ever was when on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6871",5160,"my body.  And at Gwales in Penvro you will be fourscore years, and you","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6872",5160,"may remain there, and the head with you uncorrupted, until you open the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6873",5160,"door that looks towards Aber Henvelen, and towards Cornwall.  And after","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6874",5160,"you have opened that door, there you may no longer tarry, set forth then","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6875",5160,"to London to bury the head, and go straight forward.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6876",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6877",5160,"So they cut off his head, and these seven went forward therewith.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6878",5160,"Branwen was the eighth with them, and they came to land at Aber Alaw, in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6879",5160,"Talebolyon, and they sat down to rest.  And Branwen looked towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6880",5160,"Ireland and towards the Island of the Mighty, to see if she could descry","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6881",5160,"them.  “Alas,” said she, “woe is me that I was ever born; two islands","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6882",5160,"have been destroyed because of me!”  Then she uttered a loud groan, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6883",5160,"there broke her heart.  And they made her a four-sided grave, and buried","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6884",5160,"her upon the banks of the Alaw.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6885",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6886",5160,"Then the seven men journeyed forward towards Harlech, bearing the head","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6887",5160,"with them; and as they went, behold there met them a multitude of men and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6888",5160,"of women.  “Have you any tidings?” asked Manawyddan.  “We have none,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6889",5160,"said they, “save that Caswallawn the son of Beli has conquered the Island","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6890",5160,"of the Mighty, and is crowned king in London.”  “What has become,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6891",5160,"they, “of Caradawc the son of Bran, and the seven men who were left with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6892",5160,"him in this island?”  “Caswallawn came upon them, and slew six of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6893",5160,"men, and Caradawc’s heart broke for grief thereof; for he could see the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6894",5160,"sword that slew the men, but knew not who it was that wielded it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6895",5160,"Caswallawn had flung upon him the Veil of Illusion, so that no one could","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6896",5160,"see him slay the men, but the sword only could they see.  And it liked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6897",5160,"him not to slay Caradawc, because he was his nephew, the son of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6898",5160,"cousin.  And now he was the third whose heart had broke through grief.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6899",5160,"Pendaran Dyved, who had remained as a young page with these men, escaped","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6900",5160,"into the wood,” said they.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6901",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6902",5160,"Then they went on to Harlech, and there stopped to rest, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6903",5160,"provided meat and liquor, and sat down to eat and to drink.  And there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6904",5160,"came three birds, and began singing unto them a certain song, and all the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6905",5160,"songs they had ever heard were unpleasant compared thereto; and the birds","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6906",5160,"seemed to them to be at a great distance from them over the sea, yet they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6907",5160,"appeared as distinct as if they were close by, and at this repast they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6908",5160,"continued seven years.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6909",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6910",5160,"And at the close of the seventh year they went forth to Gwales in Penvro.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6911",5160,"And there they found a fair and regal spot overlooking the ocean; and a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6912",5160,"spacious hall was therein.  And they went into the hall, and two of its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6913",5160,"doors were open, but the third door was closed, that which looked towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6914",5160,"Cornwall.  “See, yonder,” said Manawyddan, “is the door that we may not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6915",5160,"open.”  And that night they regaled themselves and were joyful.  And of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6916",5160,"all they had seen of food laid before them, and of all they had heard of,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6917",5160,"they remembered nothing; neither of that, nor of any sorrow whatsoever.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6918",5160,"And there they remained fourscore years, unconscious of having ever spent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6919",5160,"a time more joyous and mirthful.  And they were not more weary than when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6920",5160,"first they came, neither did they, any of them, know the time they had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6921",5160,"been there.  And it was not more irksome to them having the head with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6922",5160,"them, than if Bendigeid Vran had been with them himself.  And because of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6923",5160,"these fourscore years, it was called “the Entertaining of the noble","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6924",5160,"Head.”  The entertaining of Branwen and Matholwch was in the time that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6929",5160,"opened the door and looked towards Cornwall and Aber Henvelen.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6930",5160,"they had looked, they were as conscious of all the evils they had ever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6931",5160,"sustained, and of all the friends and companions they had lost, and of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6934",5160,"their perturbation they could not rest, but journeyed forth with the head","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6935",5160,"towards London.  And they buried the head in the White Mount, and when it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6936",5160,"was buried, this was the third goodly concealment; and it was the third","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6937",5160,"ill-fated disclosure when it was disinterred, inasmuch as no invasion","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6938",5160,"from across the sea came to this island while the head was in that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"6984",5160,"me,” said Pryderi, “wherein Rhiannon my mother dwells.  I will bestow her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6985",5160,"upon thee and the seven Cantrevs with her, and though thou hadst no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6986",5160,"possessions but those Cantrevs only, thou couldst not have seven Cantrevs","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6987",5160,"fairer than they.  Kicva, the daughter of Gwynn Gloyw, is my wife, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6988",5160,"since the inheritance of the Cantrevs belongs to me, do thou and Rhiannon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6989",5160,"enjoy them, and if thou ever desire any possessions thou wilt take","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6990",5160,"these.”  “I do not, Chieftain,” said he; “Heaven reward thee for thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6991",5160,"friendship.”  “I would show thee the best friendship in the world if thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6992",5160,"wouldst let me.”  “I will, my friend,” said he, “and Heaven reward thee.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6993",5160,"I will go with thee to seek Rhiannon and to look at thy possessions.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6994",5160,"“Thou wilt do well,” he answered.  “And I believe that thou didst never","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6995",5160,"hear a lady discourse better than she, and when she was in her prime none","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6996",5160,"was ever fairer.  Even now her aspect is not uncomely.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6997",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6998",5160,"They set forth, and, however long the journey, they came at length to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"6999",5160,"Dyved, and a feast was prepared for them against their coming to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7000",5160,"Narberth, which Rhiannon and Kicva had provided.  Then began Manawyddan","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7001",5160,"and Rhiannon to sit and to talk together, and from their discourse his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7002",5160,"mind and his thoughts became warmed towards her, and he thought in his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7003",5160,"heart he had never beheld any lady more fulfilled of grace and beauty","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7004",5160,"than she.  “Pryderi,” said he, “I will that it be as thou didst say.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7005",5160,"“What saying was that?” asked Rhiannon.  “Lady,” said Pryderi, “I did","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7006",5160,"offer thee as a wife to Manawyddan the son of Llyr.”  “By that will I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7007",5160,"gladly abide,” said Rhiannon.  “Right glad am I also,” said Manawyddan;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7008",5160,"“may Heaven reward him who hath shown unto me friendship so perfect as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7009",5160,"this.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7010",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7011",5160,"And before the feast was over she became his bride.  Said Pryderi, “Tarry","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7012",5160,"ye here the rest of the feast, and I will go into Lloegyr to tender my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7013",5160,"homage unto Caswallawn the son of Beli.”  “Lord,” said Rhiannon,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7014",5160,"“Caswallawn is in Kent, thou mayest therefore tarry at the feast, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7015",5160,"wait until he shall be nearer.”  “We will wait,” he answered.  So they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7016",5160,"finished the feast.  And they began to make the circuit of Dyved, and to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7017",5160,"hunt, and to take their pleasure.  And as they went through the country,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7018",5160,"they had never seen lands more pleasant to live in, nor better hunting","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7019",5160,"grounds, nor greater plenty of honey and fish.  And such was the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7020",5160,"friendship between those four, that they would not be parted from each","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7021",5160,"other by night nor by day.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7022",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7023",5160,"And in the midst of all this he went to Caswallawn at Oxford, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7024",5160,"tendered his homage; and honourable was his reception there, and highly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7025",5160,"was he praised for offering his homage.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7026",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7027",5160,"And after his return, Pryderi and Manawyddan feasted and took their ease","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7028",5160,"and pleasure.  And they began a feast at Narberth, for it was the chief","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7029",5160,"palace; and there originated all honour.  And when they had ended the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7030",5160,"first meal that night, while those who served them ate, they arose and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7031",5160,"went forth, and proceeded all four to the Gorsedd of Narberth, and their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7032",5160,"retinue with them.  And as they sat thus, behold, a peal of thunder, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7033",5160,"with the violence of the thunderstorm, lo there came a fall of mist, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7034",5160,"thick that not one of them could see the other.  And after the mist it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7035",5160,"became light all around.  And when they looked towards the place where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7036",5160,"they were wont to see cattle, and herds, and dwellings, they saw nothing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7037",5160,"now, neither house, nor beast, nor smoke, nor fire, nor man, nor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7038",5160,"dwelling; but the houses of the Court empty, and desert, and uninhabited,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7039",5160,"without either man or beast within them.  And truly all their companions","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7040",5160,"were lost to them, without their knowing aught of what had befallen them,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7041",5160,"save those four only.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7042",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7043",5160,"“In the name of Heaven,” cried Manawyddan, “where are they of the Court,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7044",5160,"and all my host beside these?  Let us go and see.”  So they came into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7045",5160,"hall, and there was no man; and they went on to the castle and to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7046",5160,"sleeping-place, and they saw none; and in the mead-cellar and in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7047",5160,"kitchen there was nought but desolation.  So they four feasted, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7048",5160,"hunted, and took their pleasure.  Then they began to go through the land","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7049",5160,"and all the possessions that they had, and they visited the houses and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7050",5160,"dwellings, and found nothing but wild beasts.  And when they had consumed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7051",5160,"their feast and all their provisions, they fed upon the prey they killed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7052",5160,"in hunting, and the honey of the wild swarms.  And thus they passed the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7053",5160,"first year pleasantly, and the second; but at the last they began to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7054",5160,"weary.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7055",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7056",5160,"“Verily,” said Manawyddan, “we must not bide thus.  Let us go into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7057",5160,"Lloegyr, and seek some craft whereby we may gain our support.”  So they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7058",5160,"went into Lloegyr, and came as far as Hereford.  And they betook","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7059",5160,"themselves to making saddles.  And Manawyddan began to make housings, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7060",5160,"he gilded and coloured them with blue enamel, in the manner that he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7061",5160,"seen it done by Llasar Llaesgywydd.  And he made the blue enamel as it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7062",5160,"was made by the other man.  And therefore is it still called Calch Lasar","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7063",5160,"[blue enamel], because Llasar Llaesgywydd had wrought it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7064",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7065",5160,"And as long as that workmanship could be had of Manawyddan, neither","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7066",5160,"saddle nor housing was bought of a saddler throughout all Hereford; till","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7067",5160,"at length every one of the saddlers perceived that they were losing much","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7068",5160,"of their gain, and that no man bought of them, but him who could not get","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7069",5160,"what he sought from Manawyddan.  Then they assembled together, and agreed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7070",5160,"to slay him and his companions.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7071",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7072",5160,"Now they received warning of this, and took counsel whether they should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7073",5160,"leave the city.  “By Heaven,” said Pryderi, “it is not my counsel that we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7074",5160,"should quit the town, but that we should slay these boors.”  “Not so,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7075",5160,"said Manawyddan, “for if we fight with them, we shall have evil fame, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7076",5160,"shall be put in prison.  It were better for us to go to another town to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7077",5160,"maintain ourselves.”  So they four went to another city.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7078",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7079",5160,"“What craft shall we take?” said Pryderi.  “We will make shields,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7080",5160,"Manawyddan.  “Do we know anything about that craft?” said Pryderi.  “We","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7081",5160,"will try,” answered he.  There they began to make shields, and fashioned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7082",5160,"them after the shape of the good shields they had seen; and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7083",5160,"enamelled they, as them had done the saddles.  And they prospered in that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7084",5160,"place, so that not a shield was asked for in the whole town, but such as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7085",5160,"was had of them.  Rapid therefore was their work, and numberless were the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7086",5160,"shields they made.  But at last they were marked by the craftsmen, who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7087",5160,"came together in haste, and their fellow-townsmen with them, and agreed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7088",5160,"that they should seek to slay them.  But they received warning, and heard","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7089",5160,"how the men had resolved on their destruction.  “Pryderi,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7090",5160,"Manawyddan, “these men desire to slay us.”  “Let us not endure this from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7091",5160,"these boors, but let us rather fall upon them and slay them.”  “Not so,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7092",5160,"he answered; “Caswallawn and his men will hear of it, and we shall be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7093",5160,"undone.  Let us go to another town.”  So to another town they went.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7094",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7095",5160,"“What craft shall we take?” said Manawyddan.  “Whatsoever thou wilt that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7096",5160,"we know,” said Pryderi.  “Not so,” he replied, “but let us take to making","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7097",5160,"shoes, for there is not courage enough among cordwainers either to fight","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7098",5160,"with us or to molest us.”  “I know nothing thereof,” said Pryderi.  “But","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7099",5160,"I know,” answered Manawyddan; “and I will teach thee to stitch.  We will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7100",5160,"not attempt to dress the leather, but we will buy it ready dressed and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7101",5160,"will make the shoes from it.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7102",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7103",5160,"So he began by buying the best cordwal that could be had in the town, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7104",5160,"none other would he buy except the leather for the soles; and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7105",5160,"associated himself with the best goldsmith in the town, and caused him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7106",5160,"make clasps for the shoes, and to gild the clasps, and he marked how it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7107",5160,"was done until he learnt the method.  And therefore was he called one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7108",5160,"the three makers of Gold Shoes; and, when they could be had from him, not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7109",5160,"a shoe nor hose was bought of any of the cordwainers in the town.  But","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7110",5160,"when the cordwainers perceived that their gains were failing (for as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7111",5160,"Manawyddan shaped the work, so Pryderi stitched it), they came together","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7112",5160,"and took counsel, and agreed that they would slay them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7113",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7114",5160,"“Pryderi,” said Manawyddan, “these men are minded to slay us.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7115",5160,"“Wherefore should we bear this from the boorish thieves?” said Pryderi.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7116",5160,"“Rather let us slay them all.”  “Not so,” said Manawyddan, “we will not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7117",5160,"slay them, neither will we remain in Lloegyr any longer.  Let us set","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7118",5160,"forth to Dyved and go to see it.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7119",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7120",5160,"So they journeyed along until they came to Dyved, and they went forward","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7121",5160,"to Narberth.  And there they kindled fire and supported themselves by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7122",5160,"hunting.  And thus they spent a month.  And they gathered their dogs","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7123",5160,"around them, and tarried there one year.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7124",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7125",5160,"And one morning Pryderi and Manawyddan rose up to hunt, and they ranged","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7126",5160,"their dogs and went forth from the palace.  And some of the dogs ran","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7127",5160,"before them and came to a small bush which was near at hand; but as soon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7128",5160,"as they were come to the bush, they hastily drew back and returned to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7129",5160,"men, their hair bristling up greatly.  “Let us go near to the bush,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7130",5160,"Pryderi, “and see what is in it.”  And as they came near, behold, a wild","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7131",5160,"boar of a pure white colour rose up from the bush.  Then the dogs, being","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7132",5160,"set on by the men, rushed towards him; but he left the bush and fell back","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7133",5160,"a little way from the men, and made a stand against the dogs without","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7134",5160,"retreating from them, until the men had come near.  And when the men came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7135",5160,"up, he fell back a second time, and betook him to flight.  Then they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7136",5160,"pursued the boar until they beheld a vast and lofty castle, all newly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7137",5160,"built, in a place where they had never before seen either stone or","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7138",5160,"building.  And the boar ran swiftly into the castle and the dogs after","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7139",5160,"him.  Now when the boar and the dogs had gone into the castle, they began","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7140",5160,"to wonder at finding a castle in a place where they had never before seen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7141",5160,"any building whatsoever.  And from the top of the Gorsedd they looked and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7142",5160,"listened for the dogs.  But so long as they were there they heard not one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7143",5160,"of the dogs nor aught concerning them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7144",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7145",5160,"“Lord,” said Pryderi, “I will go into the castle to get tidings of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7146",5160,"dogs.”  “Truly,” he replied, “thou wouldst be unwise to go into this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7147",5160,"castle, which thou hast never seen till now.  If thou wouldst follow my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7148",5160,"counsel, thou wouldst not enter therein.  Whosoever has cast a spell over","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7149",5160,"this land has caused this castle to be here.”  “Of a truth,” answered","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7150",5160,"Pryderi, “I cannot thus give up my dogs.”  And for all the counsel that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7151",5160,"Manawyddan gave him, yet to the castle he went.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7152",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7153",5160,"When he came within the castle, neither man nor beast, nor boar nor dogs,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7154",5160,"nor house nor dwelling saw he within it.  But in the centre of the castle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7155",5160,"floor he beheld a fountain with marble work around it, and on the margin","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7156",5160,"of the fountain a golden bowl upon a marble slab, and chains hanging from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7157",5160,"the air, to which he saw no end.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7158",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7159",5160,"And he was greatly pleased with the beauty of the gold, and with the rich","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7160",5160,"workmanship of the bowl, and he went up to the bowl and laid hold of it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7161",5160,"And when he had taken hold of it his hands stuck to the bowl, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7162",5160,"feet to the slab on which the howl was placed, and all his joyousness","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7163",5160,"forsook him, so that he could not utter a word.  And thus he stood.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7164",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7165",5160,"And Manawyddan waited for him till near the close of the day.  And late","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7166",5160,"in the evening, being certain that he should have no tidings of Pryderi","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7167",5160,"or of the dogs, he went back to the palace.  And as he entered, Rhiannon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7168",5160,"looked at him.  “Where,” said she, “are thy companion and thy dogs?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7169",5160,"“Behold,” he answered, “the adventure that has befallen me.”  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7170",5160,"related it all unto her.  “An evil companion hast thou been,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7171",5160,"Rhiannon, “and a good companion hast thou lost.”  And with that word she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7172",5160,"went out, and proceeded towards the castle according to the direction","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7173",5160,"which he gave her.  The gate of the castle she found open.  She was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7174",5160,"nothing daunted, and she went in.  And as she went in, she perceived","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7175",5160,"Pryderi laying hold of the bowl, and she went towards him.  “Oh, my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7176",5160,"lord,” said she, “what dust thou do here?”  And she took hold of the bowl","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7177",5160,"with him; and as she did so her hands became fast to the bowl, and her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7178",5160,"feet to the slab, and she was not able to utter a word.  And with that,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7179",5160,"as it became night, lo, there came thunder upon them, and a fall of mist,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7180",5160,"and thereupon the castle vanished, and they with it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7181",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7182",5160,"When Kicva the daughter of Gwynn Gloyw saw that there was no one in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7183",5160,"palace but herself and Manawyddan, she sorrowed so that she cared not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7184",5160,"whether she lived or died.  And Manawyddan saw this.  “Thou art in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7185",5160,"wrong,” said he, “if through fear of me thou grievest thus.  I call","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7186",5160,"Heaven to witness that thou hast never seen friendship mere pure than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7187",5160,"that which I will bear thee, as long as Heaven will that thou shouldst be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7188",5160,"thus.  I declare to thee that were I in the dawn of youth I would keep my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7189",5160,"faith unto Pryderi, and unto thee also will I keep it.  Be there no fear","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7190",5160,"upon thee, therefore,” said he, “for Heaven is my witness that thou shalt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7191",5160,"meet with all the friendship thou canst wish, and that it is in my power","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7192",5160,"to show thee, as long as it shall please Heaven to continue us in this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7193",5160,"grief and woe.”  “Heaven reward thee,” she said, “and that is what I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7194",5160,"deemed of thee.”  And the damsel thereupon took courage and was glad.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7195",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7196",5160,"“Truly, lady,” said Manawyddan, “it is not fitting for us to stay here,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7197",5160,"we have lost our dogs, and we cannot get food.  Let us go into Lloegyr;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7198",5160,"it is easiest for us to find support there.”  “Gladly, lord,” said she,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7199",5160,"“we will do so.”  And they set forth together to Lloegyr.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7200",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7201",5160,"“Lord,” said she, “what craft wilt thou follow?  Take up one that is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7202",5160,"seemly.”  “None other will I take,” answered he, “save that of making","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7203",5160,"shoes, as I did formerly.”  “Lord,” said she, “such a craft becomes not a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7204",5160,"man so nobly born as thou.”  “By that however will I abide,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7205",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7206",5160,"So he began his craft, and he made all his work of the finest leather he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7207",5160,"could get in the town, and, as he had done at the other place, he caused","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7208",5160,"gilded clasps to be made for the shoes.  And except himself all the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7209",5160,"cordwainers in the town were idle, and without work.  For as long as they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7210",5160,"could be had from him, neither shoes nor hose were bought elsewhere.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7211",5160,"thus they tarried there a year, until the cordwainers became envious, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7212",5160,"took counsel concerning him.  And he had warning thereof, and it was told","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7213",5160,"him how the cordwainers had agreed together to slay him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7214",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7215",5160,"“Lord,” said Kicva, “wherefore should this be borne from these boors?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7216",5160,"“Nay,” said he, “we will go back unto Dyved.”  So towards Dyved they set","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7217",5160,"forth.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7218",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7219",5160,"Now Manawyddan, when he set out to return to Dyved, took with him a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7220",5160,"burden of wheat.  And he proceeded towards Narberth, and there he dwelt.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7221",5160,"And never was he better pleased than when he saw Narberth again, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7222",5160,"lands where he had been wont to hunt with Pryderi and with Rhiannon.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7223",5160,"he accustomed himself to fish, and to hunt the deer in their covert.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7224",5160,"then he began to prepare some ground, and he sowed a croft, and a second,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7225",5160,"and a third.  And no wheat in the world ever sprung up better.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7226",5160,"three crofts prospered with perfect growth, and no man ever saw fairer","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7227",5160,"wheat than it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7228",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7229",5160,"And thus passed the seasons of the year until the harvest came.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7230",5160,"went to look at one of his crofts, and behold it was ripe.  “I will reap","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7231",5160,"this to-morrow,” said he.  And that night he went back to Narberth, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7232",5160,"on the morrow in the grey dawn he went to reap the croft, and when he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7233",5160,"came there he found nothing but the bare straw.  Every one of the ears of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7234",5160,"the wheat was cut from off the stalk, and all the ears carried entirely","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7235",5160,"away, and nothing but the straw left.  And at this he marvelled greatly.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7236",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7237",5160,"Then he went to look at another croft, and behold that also was ripe.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7238",5160,"“Verily,” said he, “this will I reap to-morrow.”  And on the morrow he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7239",5160,"came with the intent to reap it, and when he came there he found nothing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7240",5160,"but the bare straw.  “Oh, gracious Heaven,” he exclaimed, “I know that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7241",5160,"whosoever has begun my ruin is completing it, and has also destroyed the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7242",5160,"country with me.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7243",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7244",5160,"Then he went to look at the third croft, and when he came there, finer","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7245",5160,"wheat had there never been seen, and this also was ripe.  “Evil betide","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7246",5160,"me,” said he, “if I watch not here to-night.  Whoever carried off the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7247",5160,"other corn will come in like manner to take this.  And I will know who it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7248",5160,"is.”  So he took his arms, and began to watch the croft.  And he told","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7249",5160,"Kicva all that had befallen.  “Verily,” said she, “what thinkest thou to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7250",5160,"do?”  “I will watch the croft to-night,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7251",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7252",5160,"And he went to watch the croft.  And at midnight, lo, there arose the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7253",5160,"loudest tumult in the world.  And he looked, and behold the mightiest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7254",5160,"host of mice in the world, which could neither be numbered nor measured.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7255",5160,"And he knew not what it was until the mice had made their way into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7256",5160,"croft, and each of them climbing up the straw and bending it down with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7257",5160,"its weight, had cut off one of the ears of wheat, and had carried it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7258",5160,"away, leaving there the stalk, and he saw not a single stalk there that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7259",5160,"had not a mouse to it.  And they all took their way, carrying the ears","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7260",5160,"with them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7261",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7262",5160,"In wrath and anger did he rush upon the mice, but he could no more come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7263",5160,"up with them than if they had been gnats, or birds in the air, except one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7264",5160,"only, which though it was but sluggish, went so fast that a man on foot","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7265",5160,"could scarce overtake it.  And after this one he went, and he caught it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7266",5160,"and put it in his glove, and tied up the opening of the glove with a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7267",5160,"string, and kept it with him, and returned to the palace.  Then he came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7268",5160,"to the hall where Kicva was, and he lighted a fire, and hung the glove by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7269",5160,"the string upon a peg.  “What hast thou there, lord?” said Kicva.  “A","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7270",5160,"thief,” said he, “that I found robbing me.”  “What kind of thief may it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7271",5160,"be, lord, that thou couldst put into thy glove?” said she.  “Behold I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7272",5160,"will tell thee,” he answered.  Then he showed her how his fields had been","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7273",5160,"wasted and destroyed, and how the mice came to the last of the fields in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7274",5160,"his sight.  “And one of them was less nimble than the rest, and is now in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7275",5160,"my glove; to-morrow I will hang it, and before Heaven, if I had them, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7276",5160,"would hang them all.”  “My lord,” said she, “this is marvellous; but yet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7277",5160,"it would be unseemly for a man of dignity like thee to be hanging such a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7278",5160,"reptile as this.  And if thou doest right, thou wilt not meddle with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7279",5160,"creature, but wilt let it go.”  “Woe betide me,” said he, “if I would not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7280",5160,"hang them all could I catch them, and such as I have I will hang.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7281",5160,"“Verily, lord,” said she, “there is no reason that I should succour this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7282",5160,"reptile, except to prevent discredit unto thee.  Do therefore, lord, as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7283",5160,"thou wilt.”  “If I knew of any cause in the world wherefore thou shouldst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7284",5160,"succour it, I would take thy counsel concerning it,” said Manawyddan,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7285",5160,"“but as I know of none, lady, I am minded to destroy it.”  “Do so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7286",5160,"willingly then,” said she.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7287",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7288",5160,"And then he went to the Gorsedd of Narberth, taking the mouse with him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7289",5160,"And he set up two forks on the highest part of the Gorsedd.  And while he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7290",5160,"was doing this, behold he saw a scholar coming towards him, in old and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7291",5160,"poor and tattered garments.  And it was now seven years since he had seen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7292",5160,"in that place either man or beast, except those four persons who had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7293",5160,"remained together until two of them were lost.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7294",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7295",5160,"“My lord,” said the scholar, “good day to thee.”  “Heaven prosper thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7296",5160,"and my greeting be unto thee.  And whence dost thou come, scholar?” asked","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7297",5160,"he.  “I come, lord, from singing in Lloegyr; and wherefore dost thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7298",5160,"inquire?”  “Because for the last seven years,” answered he, “I have seen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7299",5160,"no man here save four secluded persons, and thyself this moment.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7300",5160,"“Truly, lord,” said he, “I go through this land unto mine own.  And what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7301",5160,"work art thou upon, lord?”  “I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7302",5160,"me,” said he.  “What manner of thief is that?” asked the scholar.  “I see","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7303",5160,"a creature in thy hand like unto a mouse, and ill does it become a man of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7304",5160,"rank equal to thine to touch a reptile such as this.  Let it go forth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7305",5160,"free.”  “I will not let it go free, by Heaven,” said he; “I caught it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7306",5160,"robbing me, and the doom of a thief will I inflict upon it, and I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7307",5160,"hang it.”  “Lord,” said he, “rather than see a man of rank equal to thine","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7308",5160,"at such a work as this, I would give thee a pound which I have received","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7309",5160,"as alms, to let the reptile go forth free.”  “I will not let it go free,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7310",5160,"said he, “by Heaven, neither will I sell it.”  “As thou wilt, lord,” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7311",5160,"answered; “except that I would not see a man of rank equal to thine","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7312",5160,"touching such a reptile, I care nought.”  And the scholar went his way.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7313",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7314",5160,"And as he was placing the crossbeam upon the two forks, behold a priest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7315",5160,"came towards him upon a horse covered with trappings.  “Good day to thee,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7316",5160,"lord,” said he.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said Manawyddan; “thy blessing.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7317",5160,"“The blessing of Heaven be upon thee.  And what, lord, art thou doing?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7318",5160,"“I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me,” said he.  “What manner","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7319",5160,"of thief, lord?” asked he.  “A creature,” he answered, “in form of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7320",5160,"mouse.  It has been robbing me, and I am inflicting upon it the doom of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7321",5160,"thief.”  “Lord,” said he, “rather than see thee touch this reptile, I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7322",5160,"would purchase its freedom.”  “By my confession to Heaven, neither will I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7323",5160,"sell it nor set it free.”  “It is true, lord, that it is worth nothing to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7324",5160,"buy; but rather than see thee defile thyself by touching such a reptile","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7325",5160,"as this, I will give thee three pounds to let it go.”  “I will not, by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7326",5160,"Heaven,” said he, “take any price for at.  As it ought, so shall it be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7327",5160,"hanged.”  “Willingly, lord, do thy good pleasure.”  And the priest went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7328",5160,"his way.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7329",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7330",5160,"Then he noosed the string around the mouse’s neck, and as he was about to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7331",5160,"draw it up, behold, he saw a bishop’s retinue with his sumpter-horses,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7332",5160,"and his attendants.  And the bishop himself came towards him.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7333",5160,"stayed his work.  “Lord bishop,” said he, “thy blessing.”  “Heaven’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7334",5160,"blessing be unto thee,” said he; “what work art thou upon?”  “Hanging a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7335",5160,"thief that I caught robbing me,” said he.  “Is not that a mouse that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7336",5160,"see in thy hand?”  “Yes,” answered he.  “And she has robbed me.”  “Aye,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7337",5160,"said he, “since I have come at the doom of this reptile, I will ransom it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7338",5160,"of thee.  I will give thee seven pounds for it, and that rather than see","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7339",5160,"a man of rank equal to thine destroying so vile a reptile as this.  Let","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7340",5160,"it loose and thou shalt have the money.”  “I declare to Heaven that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7341",5160,"will not set it loose.”  “If thou wilt not loose it for this, I will give","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7342",5160,"thee four-and-twenty pounds of ready money to set it free.”  “I will not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7343",5160,"set it free, by Heaven, for as much again,” said he.  “If thou wilt not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7344",5160,"set it free for this, I will give thee all the horses that thou seest in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7345",5160,"this plain, and the seven loads of baggage, and the seven horses that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7346",5160,"they are upon.”  “By Heaven, I will not,” he replied.  “Since for this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7347",5160,"thou wilt not, do so at what price soever thou wilt.”  “I will do so,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7348",5160,"said he.  “I will that Rhiannon and Pryderi be free,” said he.  “That","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7349",5160,"thou shalt have,” he answered.  “Not yet will I loose the mouse, by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7350",5160,"Heaven.”  “What then wouldst thou?”  “That the charm and the illusion be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7351",5160,"removed from the seven Cantrevs of Dyved.”  “This shalt thou have also;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7352",5160,"set therefore the mouse free.”  “I will not set it free, by Heaven,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7353",5160,"he.  “I will know who the mouse may be.”  “She is my wife.”  “Even though","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7354",5160,"she be, I will not set her free.  Wherefore came she to me?”  “To despoil","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7355",5160,"thee,” he answered.  “I am Llwyd the son of Kilcoed, and I cast the charm","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7356",5160,"over the seven Cantrevs of Dyved.  And it was to avenge Gwawl the son of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7357",5160,"Clud, from the friendship I had towards him, that I cast the charm.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7358",5160,"upon Pryderi did I revenge Gwawl the son of Clud, for the game of Badger","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7359",5160,"in the Bag, that Pwyll Pen Annwvyn played upon him, which he did","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7360",5160,"unadvisedly in the Court of Heveydd Hên.  And when it was known that thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7361",5160,"wast come to dwell in the land, my household came and besought me to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7362",5160,"transform them into mice, that they might destroy thy corn.  And it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7363",5160,"my own household that went the first night.  And the second night also","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7364",5160,"they went, and they destroyed thy two crofts.  And the third night came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7365",5160,"unto me my wife and the ladies of the Court, and besought me to transform","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7366",5160,"them.  And I transformed them.  Now she is pregnant.  And had she not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7367",5160,"been pregnant thou wouldst not have been able to overtake her; but since","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7368",5160,"this has taken place, and she has been caught, I will restore thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7369",5160,"Pryderi and Rhiannon; and I will take the charm and illusion from off","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7370",5160,"Dyved.  I have now told thee who she is.  Set her therefore free.”  “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7371",5160,"will not set her free, by Heaven,” said he.  “What wilt thou more?” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7372",5160,"asked.  “I will that there be no more charm upon the seven Cantrevs of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7373",5160,"Dyved, and that none shall be put upon it henceforth.”  “This thou shalt","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7374",5160,"have,” said he.  “Now set her free.”  “I will not, by my faith,” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7375",5160,"answered.  “What wilt thou furthermore?” asked he.  “Behold,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7376",5160,"“this will I have; that vengeance be never taken for this, either upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7377",5160,"Pryderi or Rhiannon, or upon me.”  “All this shalt thou have.  And truly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7378",5160,"thou hast done wisely in asking this.  Upon thy head would have lighted","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7379",5160,"all this trouble.”  “Yea,” said he, “for fear thereof was it, that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7380",5160,"required this.”  “Set now my wife at liberty.”  “I will not, by Heaven,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7381",5160,"said he, “until I see Pryderi and Rhiannon with me free.”  “Behold, here","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7382",5160,"they come,” he answered.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7383",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7384",5160,"And thereupon behold Pryderi and Rhiannon.  And he rose up to meet them,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7385",5160,"and greeted them, and sat down beside them.  “Ah, Chieftain, set now my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7386",5160,"wife at liberty,” said the bishop.  “Hast thou not received all thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7387",5160,"didst ask?”  “I will release her gladly,” said he.  And thereupon he set","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7388",5160,"her free.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7389",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7390",5160,"Then Llwyd struck her with a magic wand, and she was changed back into a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"7395",5160,"looked forth.  And when he looked he saw all the lands tilled, and full","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7396",5160,"of herds and dwellings.  “What bondage,” he inquired, “has there been","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7397",5160,"upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?”  “Pryderi has had the knockers of the gate of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7398",5160,"my palace about his neck, and Rhiannon has had the collars of the asses,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"7433",5160,"should do because of her, and therefrom behold his hue, and his aspect,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"7443",5160,"Mathonwy has this property, that if men whisper together, in a tone how","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7444",5160,"low soever, if the wind meet it, it becomes known unto him.”  “Yes,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"7446",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7447",5160,"When he found that his brother knew his intent, he gave the heaviest sigh","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"7449",5160,"thereby that thou wilt succeed.  I will cause,” said he, “if it cannot be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7450",5160,"otherwise, the rising of Gwynedd, and Powys, and Deheubarth, to seek the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"7452",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7453",5160,"So they went unto Math the son of Mathonwy.  “Lord,” said Gwydion, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7454",5160,"have heard that there have come to the South some beasts, such as were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7455",5160,"never known in this island before.”  “What are they called?” he asked.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7456",5160,"“Pigs, lord.”  “And what kind of animals are they?”  “They are small","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7457",5160,"animals, and their flesh is better than the flesh of oxen.”  “They are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7458",5160,"small, then?”  “And they change their names.  Swine are they now called.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7459",5160,"“Who owneth them?”  “Pryderi the son of Pwyll; they were sent him from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7460",5160,"Annwvyn, by Arawn the king of Annwvyn, and still they keep that name,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7461",5160,"half hog, half pig.”  “Verily,” asked he, “and by what means may they be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7462",5160,"obtained from him?”  “I will go, lord, as one of twelve, in the guise of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7463",5160,"bards, to seek the swine.”  “But it may be that he will refuse you,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7464",5160,"he.  “My journey will not be evil, lord,” said he; “I will not come back","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7465",5160,"without the swine.”  “Gladly,” said he, “go thou forward.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7466",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7467",5160,"So he and Gilvaethwy went, and ten other men with them.  And they came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7468",5160,"into Ceredigiawn, to the place that is now called Rhuddlan Teivi, where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7469",5160,"the palace of Pryderi was.  In the guise of bards they came in, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7470",5160,"were received joyfully, and Gwydion was placed beside Pryderi that night.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7471",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7472",5160,"“Of a truth,” said Pryderi, “gladly would I have a tale from some of your","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7473",5160,"men yonder.”  “Lord,” said Gwydion, “we have a custom that the first","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7474",5160,"night that we come to the Court of a great man, the chief of song","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7475",5160,"recites.  Gladly will I relate a tale.”  Now Gwydion was the best teller","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7476",5160,"of tales in the world, and he diverted all the Court that night with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7477",5160,"pleasant discourse and with tales, so that he charmed every one in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7478",5160,"Court, and it pleased Pryderi to talk with him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7479",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7480",5160,"And after this, “Lord,” said he unto Pryderi, “were it more pleasing to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7481",5160,"thee, that another should discharge my errand unto thee, than that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7482",5160,"should tell thee myself what it is?”  “No,” he answered, “ample speech","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7483",5160,"hast thou.”  “Behold then, lord,” said he, “my errand.  It is to crave","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7484",5160,"from thee the animals that were sent thee from Annwvyn.”  “Verily,” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7485",5160,"replied, “that were the easiest thing in the world to grant, were there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7486",5160,"not a covenant between me and my land concerning them.  And the covenant","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7487",5160,"is that they shall not go from me, until they have produced double their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7488",5160,"number in the land.”  “Lord,” said he, “I can set thee free from those","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7489",5160,"words, and this is the way I can do so; give me not the swine to-night,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7490",5160,"neither refuse them unto me, and to-morrow I will show thee an exchange","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7491",5160,"for them.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7492",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7493",5160,"And that night he and his fellows went unto their lodging, and they took","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7494",5160,"counsel.  “Ah, my men,” said he, “we shall not have the swine for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7495",5160,"asking.”  “Well,” said they, “how may they be obtained?”  “I will cause","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7496",5160,"them to be obtained,” said Gwydion.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7497",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7498",5160,"Then he betook himself to his arts, and began to work a charm.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7499",5160,"caused twelve chargers to appear, and twelve black greyhounds, each of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7500",5160,"them white-breasted, and having upon them twelve collars and twelve","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7501",5160,"leashes, such as no one that saw them could know to be other than gold.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7502",5160,"And upon the horses twelve saddles, and every part which should have been","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7503",5160,"of iron was entirely of gold, and the bridles were of the same","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7504",5160,"workmanship.  And with the horses and the dogs he came to Pryderi.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7505",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7506",5160,"“Good day unto thee, lord,” said he.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7507",5160,"other, “and greetings be unto thee.”  “Lord,” said he, “behold here is a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7508",5160,"release for thee from the word which thou spakest last evening concerning","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7509",5160,"the swine; that thou wouldst neither give nor sell them.  Thou mayest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7510",5160,"exchange them for that which is better.  And I will give these twelve","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7511",5160,"horses, all caparisoned as they are, with their saddles and their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7512",5160,"bridles, and these twelve greyhounds, with their collars and their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7513",5160,"leashes as thou seest, and the twelve gilded shields that thou beholdest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7514",5160,"yonder.”  Now these he had formed of fungus.  “Well,” said he, “we will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7515",5160,"take counsel.”  And they consulted together, and determined to give the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7516",5160,"swine to Gwydion, and to take his horses and his dogs and his shields.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7517",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7518",5160,"Then Gwydion and his men took their leave, and began to journey forth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7519",5160,"with the pigs.  “Ah, my comrades,” said Gwydion, “it is needful that we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7520",5160,"journey with speed.  The illusion will not last but from the one hour to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7521",5160,"the same to-morrow.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7522",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7523",5160,"And that night they journeyed as far as the upper part of Ceredigiawn, to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7524",5160,"the place which, from that cause, is called Mochdrev still.  And the next","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7525",5160,"day they took their course through Melenydd, and came that night to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7526",5160,"town which is likewise for that reason called Mochdrev between Keri and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7527",5160,"Arwystli.  And thence they journeyed forward; and that night they came as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7528",5160,"far as that Commot in Powys, which also upon account thereof is called","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7529",5160,"Mochnant, and there tarried they that night.  And they journeyed thence","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7530",5160,"to the Cantrev of Rhos, and the place where they were that night is still","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7531",5160,"called Mochdrev.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7532",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7533",5160,"“My men,” said Gwydion, “we must push forward to the fastnesses of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7534",5160,"Gwynedd with these animals, for there is a gathering of hosts in pursuit","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7535",5160,"of us.”  So they journeyed on to the highest town of Arllechwedd, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7536",5160,"there they made a sty for the swine, and therefore was the name of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7537",5160,"Creuwyryon given to that town.  And after they had made the sty for the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7538",5160,"swine, they proceeded to Math the son of Mathonwy, at Caer Dathyl.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7539",5160,"when they came there, the country was rising.  “What news is there here?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7540",5160,"asked Gwydion.  “Pryderi is assembling one-and-twenty Cantrevs to pursue","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7541",5160,"after you,” answered they.  “It is marvellous that you should have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7542",5160,"journeyed so slowly.”  “Where are the animals whereof you went in quest?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7543",5160,"said Math.  “They have had a sty made for them in the other Cantrev","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7544",5160,"below,” said Gwydion.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7545",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7546",5160,"Thereupon, lo, they heard the trumpets and the host in the land, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7547",5160,"arrayed themselves and set forward and came to Penardd in Arvon.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7548",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7549",5160,"And at night Gwydion the son of Don, and Gilvaethwy his brother, returned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7550",5160,"to Caer Dathyl; and Gilvaethwy took Math the son of Mathonwy’s couch.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7551",5160,"And while he turned out the other damsels from the room discourteously,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7552",5160,"he made Goewin unwillingly remain.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7553",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7554",5160,"And when they saw the day on the morrow, they went back unto the place","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7555",5160,"where Math the son of Mathonwy was with his host; and when they came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7556",5160,"there, the warriors were taking counsel in what district they should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7557",5160,"await the coming of Pryderi, and the men of the South.  So they went in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7558",5160,"to the council.  And it was resolved to wait in the strongholds of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7559",5160,"Gwynedd, in Arvon.  So within the two Maenors they took their stand,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7560",5160,"Maenor Penardd and Maenor Coed Alun.  And there Pryderi attacked them,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7561",5160,"and there the combat took place.  And great was the slaughter on both","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7562",5160,"sides; but the men of the South were forced to flee.  And they fled unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7563",5160,"the place which is still called Nantcall.  And thither did they follow","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7564",5160,"them, and they made a vast slaughter of them there, so that they fled","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7565",5160,"again as far as the place called Dol Pen Maen, and there they halted and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7566",5160,"sought to make peace.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7567",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7568",5160,"And that he might have peace, Pryderi gave hostages, Gwrgi Gwastra gave","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7569",5160,"he and three-and-twenty others, sons of nobles.  And after this they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7570",5160,"journeyed in peace even unto Traeth Mawr; but as they went on together","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7571",5160,"towards Melenryd, the men on foot could not be restrained from shooting.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7572",5160,"Pryderi dispatched unto Math an embassy to pray him to forbid his people,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7573",5160,"and to leave it between him and Gwydion the son of Don, for that he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7574",5160,"caused all this.  And the messengers came to Math.  “Of a truth,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7575",5160,"Math, “I call Heaven to witness, if it be pleasing unto Gwydion the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7576",5160,"of Don, I will so leave it gladly.  Never will I compel any to go to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7577",5160,"fight, but that we ourselves should do our utmost.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7578",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7579",5160,"“Verily,” said the messengers, “Pryderi saith that it were more fair that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7580",5160,"the man who did him this wrong should oppose his own body to his, and let","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7581",5160,"his people remain unscathed.”  “I declare to Heaven, I will not ask the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7582",5160,"men of Gwynedd to fight because of me.  If I am allowed to fight Pryderi","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7583",5160,"myself, gladly will I oppose my body to his.”  And this answer they took","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7584",5160,"back to Pryderi.  “Truly,” said Pryderi, “I shall require no one to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7585",5160,"demand my rights but myself.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7586",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7587",5160,"Then these two came forth and armed themselves, and they fought.  And by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7588",5160,"force of strength, and fierceness, and by the magic and charms of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7589",5160,"Gwydion, Pryderi was slain.  And at Maen Tyriawc, above Melenryd, was he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7590",5160,"buried, and there is his grave.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7591",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7592",5160,"And the men of the South set forth in sorrow towards their own land; nor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7593",5160,"is it a marvel that they should grieve, seeing that they had lost their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7594",5160,"lord, and many of their best warriors, and for the most part their horses","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7595",5160,"and their arms.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7596",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7597",5160,"The men of Gwynedd went back joyful and in triumph.  “Lord,” said Gwydion","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7598",5160,"unto Math, “would it not be right for us to release the hostages of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7599",5160,"men of the South, which they pledged unto us for peace? for we ought not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7600",5160,"to put them in prison.”  “Let them then be set free,” saith Math.  So","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7601",5160,"that youth, and the other hostages that were with him, were set free to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7602",5160,"follow the men of the South.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7603",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7604",5160,"Math himself went forward to Caer Dathyl.  Gilvaethwy the son of Don, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7605",5160,"they of the household that were with him, went to make the circuit of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7606",5160,"Gwynedd as they were wont, without coming to the Court.  Math went into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7607",5160,"his chamber, and caused a place to be prepared for him whereon to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7608",5160,"recline, so that he might put his feet in the maiden’s lap.  “Lord,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7609",5160,"Goewin, “seek now another to hold thy feet, for I am now a wife.”  “What","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7610",5160,"meaneth this?” said he.  “An attack, lord, was made unawares upon me; but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7611",5160,"I held not my peace, and there was no one in the Court who knew not of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7612",5160,"it.  Now the attack was made by thy nephews, lord, the sons of thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7613",5160,"sister, Gwydion the son of Don, and Gilvaethwy the son of Don; unto me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7614",5160,"they did wrong, and unto thee dishonour.”  “Verily,” he exclaimed, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7615",5160,"will do to the utmost of my power concerning this matter.  But first I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7616",5160,"will cause thee to have compensation, and then will I have amends made","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7617",5160,"unto myself.  As for thee, I will take thee to be my wife, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7618",5160,"possession of my dominions will I give unto thy hands.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7619",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7620",5160,"And Gwydion and Gilvaethwy came not near the Court, but stayed in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7621",5160,"confines of the land until it was forbidden to give them meat and drink.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7622",5160,"At first they came not near unto Math, but at the last they came.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7623",5160,"“Lord,” said they, “good day to thee.”  “Well,” said he, “is it to make","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7624",5160,"me compensation that ye are come?”  “Lord,” they said, “we are at thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7625",5160,"will.”  “By my will I would not have lost my warriors, and so many arms","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7626",5160,"as I have done.  You cannot compensate me my shame, setting aside the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7627",5160,"death of Pryderi.  But since ye come hither to be at my will, I shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7628",5160,"begin your punishment forthwith.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7629",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7630",5160,"Then he took his magic wand, and struck Gilvaethwy, so that he became a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7631",5160,"deer, and he seized upon the other hastily lest he should escape from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7632",5160,"him.  And he struck him with the same magic wand, and he became a deer","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7633",5160,"also.  “Since now ye are in bonds, I will that ye go forth together and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7634",5160,"be companions, and possess the nature of the animals whose form ye bear.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7635",5160,"And this day twelvemonth come hither unto me.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7636",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7637",5160,"At the end of a year from that day, lo there was a loud noise under the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7638",5160,"chamber wall, and the barking of the dogs of the palace together with the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7639",5160,"noise.  “Look,” said he, “what is without.”  “Lord,” said one, “I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7640",5160,"looked; there are there two deer, and a fawn with them.”  Then he arose","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7641",5160,"and went out.  And when he came he beheld the three animals.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7642",5160,"lifted up his wand.  “As ye were deer last year, be ye wild hogs each and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7643",5160,"either of you, for the year that is to come.”  And thereupon he struck","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7644",5160,"them with the magic wand.  “The young one will I take and cause to be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7645",5160,"baptized.”  Now the name that he gave him was Hydwn.  “Go ye and be wild","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7646",5160,"swine, each and either of you, and be ye of the nature of wild swine.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7647",5160,"And this day twelvemonth be ye here under the wall.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7648",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7649",5160,"At the end of the year the barking of dogs was heard under the wall of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7650",5160,"the chamber.  And the Court assembled, and thereupon he arose and went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7651",5160,"forth, and when he came forth he beheld three beasts.  Now these were the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7652",5160,"beasts that he saw; two wild hogs of the woods, and a well-grown young","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7653",5160,"one with them.  And he was very large for his age.  “Truly,” said Math,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7654",5160,"“this one will I take and cause to be baptized.”  And he struck him with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7655",5160,"his magic wand, and he become a fine fair auburn-haired youth, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7656",5160,"name that he gave him was Hychdwn.  “Now as for you, as ye were wild hogs","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7657",5160,"last year, be ye wolves each and either of you for the year that is to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7658",5160,"come.”  Thereupon he struck them with his magic wand, and they became","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7659",5160,"wolves.  “And be ye of like nature with the animals whose semblance ye","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7660",5160,"bear, and return here this day twelvemonth beneath this wall.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7661",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7662",5160,"And at the same day at the end of the year, he heard a clamour and a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7663",5160,"barking of dogs under the wall of the chamber.  And he rose and went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7664",5160,"forth.  And when he came, behold, he saw two wolves, and a strong cub","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7665",5160,"with them.  “This one will I take,” said Math, “and I will cause him to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7666",5160,"be baptized; there is a name prepared for him, and that is Bleiddwn.  Now","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7667",5160,"these three, such are they:—","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7668",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7669",5160,"   The three sons of Gilvaethwy the false,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7670",5160,"   The three faithful combatants,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7671",5160,"   Bleiddwn, Hydwn, and Hychdwn the Tall.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7672",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7673",5160,"Then he struck the two with his magic wand, and they resumed their own","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7674",5160,"nature.  “Oh men,” said he, “for the wrong that ye did unto me sufficient","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7675",5160,"has been your punishment and your dishonour.  Prepare now precious","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7676",5160,"ointment for these men, and wash their heads, and equip them.”  And this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7677",5160,"was done.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7678",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7679",5160,"And after they were equipped, they came unto him.  “Oh men,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7680",5160,"“you have obtained peace, and you shall likewise have friendship.  Give","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7681",5160,"your counsel unto me, what maiden I shall seek.”  “Lord,” said Gwydion","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7682",5160,"the son of Don, “it is easy to give thee counsel; seek Arianrod, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7683",5160,"daughter of Don, thy niece, thy sister’s daughter.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7684",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7685",5160,"And they brought her unto him, and the maiden came in.  “Ha, damsel,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7686",5160,"said he, “art thou the maiden?”  “I know not, lord, other than that I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7687",5160,"am.”  Then he took up his magic wand, and bent it.  “Step over this,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7688",5160,"said he, “and I shall know if thou art the maiden.”  Then stepped she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7689",5160,"over the magic wand, and there appeared forthwith a fine chubby","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7690",5160,"yellow-haired boy.  And at the crying out of the boy, she went towards","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7691",5160,"the door.  And thereupon some small form was seen; but before any one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7692",5160,"could get a second glimpse of it, Gwydion had taken it, and had flung a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7693",5160,"scarf of velvet around it and hidden it.  Now the place where he hid it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7694",5160,"was the bottom of a chest at the foot of his bed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7695",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7696",5160,"“Verily,” said Math the son of Mathonwy, concerning the fine","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7697",5160,"yellow-haired boy, “I will cause this one to be baptized, and Dylan is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7698",5160,"the name I will give him.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7699",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7700",5160,"So they had the boy baptized, and as they baptized him he plunged into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7701",5160,"the sea.  And immediately when he was in the sea, he took its nature, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7702",5160,"swam as well as the best fish that was therein.  And for that reason was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7703",5160,"he called Dylan, the son of the Wave.  Beneath him no wave ever broke.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7704",5160,"And the blow whereby he came to his death, was struck by his uncle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7705",5160,"Govannon.  The third fatal blow was it called.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7706",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7707",5160,"As Gwydion lay one morning on his bed awake, he heard a cry in the chest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7708",5160,"at his feet; and though it was not loud, it was such that he could hear","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7709",5160,"it.  Then he arose in haste, and opened the chest: and when he opened it,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7710",5160,"he beheld an infant boy stretching out his arms from the folds of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7711",5160,"scarf, and casting it aside.  And he took up the boy in his arms, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7712",5160,"carried him to a place where he knew there was a woman that could nurse","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7713",5160,"him.  And he agreed with the woman that she should take charge of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7714",5160,"boy.  And that year he was nursed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7715",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7716",5160,"And at the end of the year he seemed by his size as though he were two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7717",5160,"years old.  And the second year he was a big child, and able to go to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7718",5160,"Court by himself.  And when he came to the Court, Gwydion noticed him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7719",5160,"and the boy became familiar with him, and loved him better than any one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7720",5160,"else.  Then was the boy reared at the Court until he was four years old,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7721",5160,"when he was as big as though he had been eight.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7722",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7723",5160,"And one day Gwydion walked forth, and the boy followed him, and he went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7724",5160,"to the Castle of Arianrod, having the boy with him; and when he came into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7725",5160,"the Court, Arianrod arose to meet him, and greeted him and bade him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7726",5160,"welcome.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said he.  “Who is the boy that followeth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7727",5160,"thee?” she asked.  “This youth, he is thy son,” he answered.  “Alas,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7728",5160,"said she, “what has come unto thee that thou shouldst shame me thus?","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7729",5160,"wherefore dost thou seek my dishonour, and retain it so long as this?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7730",5160,"“Unless thou suffer dishonour greater than that of my bringing up such a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7731",5160,"boy as this, small will be thy disgrace.”  “What is the name of the boy?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7732",5160,"said she.  “Verily,” he replied, “he has not yet a name.”  “Well,” she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7733",5160,"said, “I lay this destiny upon him, that he shall never have a name until","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7734",5160,"he receives one from me.”  “Heaven bears me witness,” answered he, “that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7735",5160,"thou art a wicked woman.  But the boy shall have a name how displeasing","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7736",5160,"soever it may be unto thee.  As for thee, that which afflicts thee is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7737",5160,"that thou art no longer called a damsel.”  And thereupon he went forth in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7738",5160,"wrath, and returned to Caer Dathyl and there he tarried that night.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7739",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7740",5160,"And the next day he arose and took the boy with him, and went to walk on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7741",5160,"the seashore between that place and Aber Menei.  And there he saw some","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7742",5160,"sedges and seaweed, and he turned them into a boat.  And out of dry","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7743",5160,"sticks and sedges he made some Cordovan leather, and a great deal","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7744",5160,"thereof, and he coloured it in such a manner that no one ever saw leather","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7745",5160,"more beautiful than it.  Then he made a sail to the boat, and he and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7746",5160,"boy went in it to the port of the castle of Arianrod.  And he began","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7747",5160,"forming shoes and stitching them, until he was observed from the castle.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7748",5160,"And when he knew that they of the castle were observing him, he disguised","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7749",5160,"his aspect, and put another semblance upon himself, and upon the boy, so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7750",5160,"that they might not be known.  “What men are those in yonder boat?” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7751",5160,"Arianrod.  “They are cordwainers,” answered they.  “Go and see what kind","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7752",5160,"of leather they have, and what kind of work they can do.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7753",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7754",5160,"So they came unto them.  And when they came he was colouring some","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7755",5160,"Cordovan leather, and gilding it.  And the messengers came and told her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7756",5160,"this.  “Well,” said she, “take the measure of my foot, and desire the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7757",5160,"cordwainer to make shoes for me.”  So he made the shoes for her, yet not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7758",5160,"according to the measure, but larger.  The shoes then were brought unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7759",5160,"her, and behold they were too large.  “These are too large,” said she,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7760",5160,"“but he shall receive their value.  Let him also make some that are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7761",5160,"smaller than they.”  Then he made her others that were much smaller than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7762",5160,"her foot, and sent them unto her.  “Tell him that these will not go on my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7763",5160,"feet,” said she.  And they told him this.  “Verily,” said he, “I will not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7764",5160,"make her any shoes, unless I see her foot.”  And this was told unto her.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7765",5160,"“Truly,” she answered, “I will go unto him.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7766",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7767",5160,"So she went down to the boat, and when she came there, he was shaping","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7768",5160,"shoes and the boy stitching them.  “Ah, lady,” said he, “good day to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7769",5160,"thee.”  “Heaven prosper thee,” said she.  “I marvel that thou canst not","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7770",5160,"manage to make shoes according to a measure.”  “I could not,” he replied,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7771",5160,"“but now I shall be able.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7772",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7773",5160,"Thereupon behold a wren stood upon the deck of the boat, and the boy shot","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7774",5160,"at it, and hit it in the leg between the sinew and the bone.  Then she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7775",5160,"smiled.  “Verily,” said she, “with a steady hand did the lion aim at it.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7776",5160,"“Heaven reward thee not, but now has he got a name.  And a good enough","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7777",5160,"name it is.  Llew Llaw Gyffes be he called henceforth.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7778",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7779",5160,"Then the work disappeared in seaweed and sedges, and he went on with it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7780",5160,"no further.  And for that reason was he called the third Gold-shoemaker.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7781",5160,"“Of a truth,” said she, “thou wilt not thrive the better for doing evil","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7782",5160,"unto me.”  “I have done thee no evil yet,” said he.  Then he restored the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7783",5160,"boy to his own form.  “Well,” said she, “I will lay a destiny upon this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7784",5160,"boy, that he shall never have arms and armour until I invest him with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7785",5160,"them.”  “By Heaven,” said he, “let thy malice be what it may, he shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7786",5160,"have arms.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7787",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7788",5160,"Then they went towards Dinas Dinllev, and there he brought up Llew Llaw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7789",5160,"Gyffes, until he could manage any horse, and he was perfect in features,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7790",5160,"and strength, and stature.  And then Gwydion saw that he languished","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7791",5160,"through the want of horses and arms.  And he called him unto him.  “Ah,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7792",5160,"youth,” said he, “we will go to-morrow on an errand together.  Be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7793",5160,"therefore more cheerful than thou art.”  “That I will,” said the youth.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7794",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7795",5160,"Next morning, at the dawn of day, they arose.  And they took way along","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7796",5160,"the sea coast, up towards Bryn Aryen.  And at the top of Cevn Clydno they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7797",5160,"equipped themselves with horses, and went towards the Castle of Arianrod.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7798",5160,"And they changed their form, and pricked towards the gate in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7799",5160,"semblance of two youths, but the aspect of Gwydion was more staid than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7800",5160,"that of the other.  “Porter,” said he, “go thou in and say that there are","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7801",5160,"here bards from Glamorgan.”  And the porter went in.  “The welcome of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7802",5160,"Heaven be unto them, let them in,” said Arianrod.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7803",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7804",5160,"With great joy were they greeted.  And the hall was arranged, and they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7805",5160,"went to meat.  When meat was ended, Arianrod discoursed with Gwydion of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7806",5160,"tales and stories.  Now Gwydion was an excellent teller of tales.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7807",5160,"when it was time to leave off feasting, a chamber was prepared for them,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7808",5160,"and they went to rest.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7809",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7810",5160,"In the early twilight Gwydion arose, and he called unto him his magic and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7811",5160,"his power.  And by the time that the day dawned, there resounded through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7812",5160,"the land uproar, and trumpets and shouts.  When it was now day, they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7813",5160,"heard a knocking at the door of the chamber, and therewith Arianrod","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7814",5160,"asking that it might be opened.  Up rose the youth and opened unto her,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7815",5160,"and she entered and a maiden with her.  “Ah, good men,” she said, “in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7816",5160,"evil plight are we.”  “Yes, truly,” said Gwydion, “we have heard trumpets","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7817",5160,"and shouts; what thinkest thou that they may mean?”  “Verily,” said she,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7818",5160,"“we cannot see the colour of the ocean by reason of all the ships, side","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7819",5160,"by side.  And they are making for the land with all the speed they can.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7820",5160,"And what can we do?” said she.  “Lady,” said Gwydion, “there is none","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7821",5160,"other counsel than to close the castle upon us, and to defend it as best","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7822",5160,"we may.”  “Truly,” said she, “may Heaven reward you.  And do you defend","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7823",5160,"it.  And here may you have plenty of arms.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7824",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7825",5160,"And thereupon went she forth for the arms, and behold she returned, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7826",5160,"two maidens, and suits of armour for two men, with her.  “Lady,” said he,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7827",5160,"“do you accoutre this stripling, and I will arm myself with the help of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7828",5160,"thy maidens.  Lo, I hear the tumult of the men approaching.”  “I will do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7829",5160,"so, gladly.”  So she armed him fully, and that right cheerfully.  “Hast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7830",5160,"thou finished arming the youth?” said he.  “I have finished,” she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7831",5160,"answered.  “I likewise have finished,” said Gwydion.  “Let us now take","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7832",5160,"off our arms, we have no need of them.”  “Wherefore?” said she.  “Here is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7833",5160,"the army around the house.”  “Oh, lady, there is here no army.”  “Oh,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7834",5160,"cried she, “whence then was this tumult?”  “The tumult was but to break","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7835",5160,"thy prophecy and to obtain arms for thy son.  And now has he got arms","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7836",5160,"without any thanks unto thee.”  “By Heaven,” said Arianrod, “thou art a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7837",5160,"wicked man.  Many a youth might have lost his life through the uproar","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7838",5160,"thou hast caused in this Cantrev to-day.  Now will I lay a destiny upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7839",5160,"this youth,” she said, “that he shall never have a wife of the race that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7840",5160,"now inhabits this earth.”  “Verily,” said he, “thou wast ever a malicious","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7841",5160,"woman, and no one ought to support thee.  A wife shall he have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7842",5160,"notwithstanding.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7843",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7844",5160,"They went thereupon unto Math the son of Mathonwy, and complained unto","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7845",5160,"him most bitterly of Arianrod.  Gwydion showed him also how he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7846",5160,"procured arms for the youth.  “Well,” said Math, “we will seek, I and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7847",5160,"thou, by charms and illusion, to form a wife for him out of flowers.  He","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7848",5160,"has now come to man’s stature, and he is the comeliest youth that was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7849",5160,"ever beheld.”  So they took the blossoms of the oak, and the blossoms of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7850",5160,"the broom, and the blossoms of the meadow-sweet, and produced from them a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7851",5160,"maiden, the fairest and most graceful that man ever saw.  And they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7852",5160,"baptized her, and gave her the name of Blodeuwedd.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7853",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7854",5160,"After she had become his bride, and they had feasted, said Gwydion, “It","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7855",5160,"is not easy for a man to maintain himself without possessions.”  “Of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7856",5160,"truth,” said Math, “I will give the young man the best Cantrev to hold.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7857",5160,"“Lord,” said he, “what Cantrev is that?”  “The Cantrev of Dinodig,” he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7858",5160,"answered.  Now it is called at this day Eivionydd and Ardudwy.  And the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7859",5160,"place in the Cantrev where he dwelt, was a palace of his in a spot called","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7860",5160,"Mur y Castell, on the confines of Ardudwy.  There dwelt he and reigned,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7861",5160,"and both he and his sway were beloved by all.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7862",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7863",5160,"One day he went forth to Caer Dathyl, to visit Math the son of Mathonwy.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7864",5160,"And on the day that he set out for Caer Dathyl, Blodeuwedd walked in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7865",5160,"Court.  And she heard the sound of a horn.  And after the sound of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7866",5160,"horn, behold a tired stag went by, with dogs and huntsmen following it.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7867",5160,"And after the dogs and the huntsmen there came a crowd of men on foot.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7868",5160,"“Send a youth,” said she, “to ask who yonder host may be.”  So a youth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7869",5160,"went, and inquired who they were.  “Gronw Pebyr is this, the lord of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7870",5160,"Penllyn,” said they.  And thus the youth told her.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7871",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7872",5160,"Gronw Pebyr pursued the stag, and by the river Cynvael he overtook the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7873",5160,"stag and killed it.  And what with flaying the stag and baiting his dogs,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7874",5160,"he was there until the night began to close in upon him.  And as the day","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7875",5160,"departed and the night drew near, he came to the gate of the Court.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7876",5160,"“Verily,” said Blodeuwedd, “the Chieftain will speak ill of us if we let","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7877",5160,"him at this hour depart to another land without inviting him in.”  “Yes,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7878",5160,"truly, lady,” said they, “it will be most fitting to invite him.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7879",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7880",5160,"Then went messengers to meet him and bid him in.  And he accepted her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7881",5160,"bidding gladly, and came to the Court, and Blodeuwedd went to meet him,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7882",5160,"and greeted him, and bade him welcome.  “Lady,” said he, “Heaven repay","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7883",5160,"thee thy kindness.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7884",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7885",5160,"When they had disaccoutred themselves, they went to sit down.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7886",5160,"Blodeuwedd looked upon him, and from the moment that she looked on him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7887",5160,"she became filled with his love.  And he gazed on her, and the same","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7888",5160,"thought came unto him as unto her, so that he could not conceal from her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7889",5160,"that he loved her, but he declared unto her that he did so.  Thereupon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7890",5160,"she was very joyful.  And all their discourse that night was concerning","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7891",5160,"the affection and love which they felt one for the other, and which in no","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7892",5160,"longer space than one evening had arisen.  And that evening passed they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7893",5160,"in each other’s company.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7894",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7895",5160,"The next day he sought to depart.  But she said, “I pray thee go not from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7896",5160,"me to-day.”  And that night he tarried also.  And that night they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7897",5160,"consulted by what means they might always be together.  “There is none","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7898",5160,"other counsel,” said he, “but that thou strive to learn from Llew Llaw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7899",5160,"Gyffes in what manner he will meet his death.  And this must thou do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7900",5160,"under the semblance of solicitude concerning him.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7901",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7902",5160,"The next day Gronw sought to depart.  “Verily,” said she, “I will counsel","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7903",5160,"thee not to go from me to-day.”  “At thy instance will I not go,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7904",5160,"he, “albeit, I must say, there is danger that the chief who owns the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7905",5160,"palace may return home.”  “To-morrow,” answered she, “will I indeed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7906",5160,"permit thee to go forth.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7907",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7908",5160,"The next day he sought to go, and she hindered him not.  “Be mindful,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7909",5160,"said Gronw, “of what I have said unto thee, and converse with him fully,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7910",5160,"and that under the guise of the dalliance of love, and find out by what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7911",5160,"means he may come to his death.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7912",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7913",5160,"That night Llew Llaw Gyffes returned to his home.  And the day they spent","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7914",5160,"in discourse, and minstrelsy, and feasting.  And at night they went to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7915",5160,"rest, and he spoke to Blodeuwedd once, and he spoke to her a second time.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7916",5160,"But, for all this, he could not get from her one word.  “What aileth","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7917",5160,"thee?” said he, “art thou well?”  “I was thinking,” said she, “of that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7918",5160,"which thou didst never think of concerning me; for I was sorrowful as to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7919",5160,"thy death, lest thou shouldst go sooner than I.”  “Heaven reward thy care","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7920",5160,"for me,” said he, “but until Heaven take me I shall not easily be slain.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7921",5160,"“For the sake of Heaven, and for mine, show me how thou mightest be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7922",5160,"slain.  My memory in guarding is better than thine.”  “I will tell thee","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7923",5160,"gladly,” said he.  “Not easily can I be slain, except by a wound.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7924",5160,"the spear wherewith I am struck must be a year in the forming.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7925",5160,"nothing must be done towards it except during the sacrifice on Sundays.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7926",5160,"“Is this certain?” asked she.  “It is in truth,” he answered.  “And I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7927",5160,"cannot be slain within a house, nor without.  I cannot be slain on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7928",5160,"horseback nor on foot.”  “Verily,” said she, “in what manner then canst","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7929",5160,"thou be slain?”  “I will tell thee,” said he.  “By making a bath for me","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7930",5160,"by the side of a river, and by putting a roof over the cauldron, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7931",5160,"thatching it well and tightly, and bringing a buck, and putting it beside","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7932",5160,"the cauldron.  Then if I place one foot on the buck’s back, and the other","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7933",5160,"on the edge of the cauldron, whosoever strikes me thus will cause my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7934",5160,"death.”  “Well,” said she, “I thank Heaven that it will be easy to avoid","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7935",5160,"this.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7936",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7937",5160,"No sooner had she held this discourse than she sent to Gronw Pebyr.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7938",5160,"Gronw toiled at making the spear, and that day twelvemonth it was ready.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7939",5160,"And that very day he caused her to be informed thereof.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7940",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7941",5160,"“Lord,” said Blodeuwedd unto Llew, “I have been thinking how it is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7942",5160,"possible that what thou didst tell me formerly can be true; wilt thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7943",5160,"show me in what manner thou couldst stand at once upon the edge of a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7944",5160,"cauldron and upon a buck, if I prepare the bath for thee?”  “I will show","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7945",5160,"thee,” said he.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7946",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7947",5160,"Then she sent unto Gronw, and bade him be in ambush on the hill which is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7948",5160,"now called Bryn Kyvergyr, on the bank of the river Cynvael.  She caused","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7949",5160,"also to be collected all the goats that were in the Cantrev, and had them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7950",5160,"brought to the other side of the river, opposite Bryn Kyvergyr.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7951",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7952",5160,"And the next day she spoke thus.  “Lord,” said she, “I have caused the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"7954",5160,"Llew, “we will go gladly to look at them.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7955",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7956",5160,"The day after they came and looked at the bath.  “Wilt thou go into the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7957",5160,"bath, lord?” said she.  “Willingly will I go in,” he answered.  So into","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7958",5160,"the bath he went, and he anointed himself.  “Lord,” said she, “behold the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7959",5160,"animals which thou didst speak of as being called bucks.”  “Well,” said","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7960",5160,"he, “cause one of them to be caught and brought here.”  And the buck was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7961",5160,"brought.  Then Llew rose out of the bath, and put on his trowsers, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7962",5160,"placed one foot on the edge of the bath and the other on the buck’s back.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7963",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7964",5160,"Thereupon Gronw rose up from the bill which is called Bryn Kyvergyr, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7965",5160,"he rested on one knee, and flung the poisoned dart and struck him on the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7966",5160,"side, so that the shaft started out, but the head of the dart remained","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7967",5160,"in.  Then he flew up in the form of an eagle and gave a fearful scream.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7968",5160,"And thenceforth was he no more seen.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7969",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7970",5160,"As soon as he departed Gronw and Blodeuwedd went together unto the palace","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7971",5160,"that night.  And the next day Gronw arose and took possession of Ardudwy.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7972",5160,"And after he had overcome the land, he ruled over it, so that Ardudwy and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7973",5160,"Penllyn were both under his sway.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7974",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7975",5160,"Then these tidings reached Math the son of Mathonwy.  And heaviness and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7976",5160,"grief came upon Math, and much more upon Gwydion than upon him.  “Lord,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7977",5160,"said Gwydion, “I shall never rest until I have tidings of my nephew.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7978",5160,"“Verily,” said Math, “may Heaven be thy strength.”  Then Gwydion set","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7979",5160,"forth and began to go forward.  And he went through Gwynedd and Powys to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7980",5160,"the confines.  And when he had done so, he went into Arvon, and came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7981",5160,"the house of a vassal, in Maenawr Penardd.  And he alighted at the house,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7982",5160,"and stayed there that night.  The man of the house and his house-hold","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7983",5160,"came in, and last of all came there the swineherd.  Said the man of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7984",5160,"house to the swineherd, “Well, youth, hath thy sow come in to-night?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7985",5160,"“She hath,” said he, “and is this instant returned to the pigs.”  “Where","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7986",5160,"doth this sow go to?” said Gwydion.  “Every day, when the sty is opened,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7987",5160,"she goeth forth and none can catch sight of her, neither is it known","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7988",5160,"whither she goeth more than if she sank into the earth.”  “Wilt thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7989",5160,"grant unto me,” said Gwydion, “not to open the sty until I am beside the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7990",5160,"sty with thee?”  “This will I do, right gladly,” he answered.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7991",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7992",5160,"That night they went to rest; and as soon as the swineherd saw the light","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7993",5160,"of day, he awoke Gwydion.  And Gwydion arose and dressed himself, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7994",5160,"went with the swineherd, and stood beside the sty.  Then the swineherd","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7995",5160,"opened the sty.  And as soon as he opened it, behold she leaped forth,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7996",5160,"and set off with great speed.  And Gwydion followed her, and she went","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7997",5160,"against the course of a river, and made for a brook, which is now called","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7998",5160,"Nant y Llew.  And there she halted and began feeding.  And Gwydion came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"7999",5160,"under the tree, and looked what it might be that the sow was feeding on.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8000",5160,"And he saw that she was eating putrid flesh and vermin.  Then looked he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8001",5160,"up to the top of the tree, and as he looked he beheld on the top of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8002",5160,"tree an eagle, and when the eagle shook itself, there fell vermin and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8003",5160,"putrid flesh from off it, and these the sow devoured.  And it seemed to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8004",5160,"him that the eagle was Llew.  And he sang an Englyn:—","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8005",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8006",5160,"   “Oak that grows between the two banks;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8007",5160,"   Darkened is the sky and hill!","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8008",5160,"   Shall I not tell him by his wounds,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8009",5160,"   That this is Llew?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8010",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8011",5160,"Upon this the eagle came down until he reached the centre of the tree.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8012",5160,"And Gwydion sang another Englyn:—","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8013",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8014",5160,"   “Oak that grows in upland ground,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8015",5160,"   Is it not wetted by the rain?  Has it not been drenched","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8016",5160,"   By nine score tempests?","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8017",5160,"   It bears in its branches Llew Llaw Gyffes!”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8018",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8019",5160,"Then the eagle came down until he was on the lowest branch of the tree,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8020",5160,"and thereupon this Englyn did Gwydion sing:—","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8021",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8022",5160,"   “Oak that grows beneath the steep;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8023",5160,"   Stately and majestic is its aspect!","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8024",5160,"   Shall I not speak it?","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8025",5160,"   That Llew will come to my lap?”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8026",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8027",5160,"And the eagle came down upon Gwydion’s knee.  And Gwydion struck him with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8028",5160,"his magic wand, so that he returned to his own form.  No one ever saw a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8029",5160,"more piteous sight, for he was nothing but skin and bone.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8030",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8031",5160,"Then he went unto Caer Dathyl, and there were brought unto him good","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8032",5160,"physicians that were in Gwynedd, and before the end of the year he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8033",5160,"quite healed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8034",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8035",5160,"“Lord,” said he unto Math the son of Mathonwy, “it is full time now that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8036",5160,"I have retribution of him by whom I have suffered all this woe.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8037",5160,"“Truly,” said Math, “he will never be able to maintain himself in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8038",5160,"possession of that which is thy right.”  “Well,” said Llew, “the sooner I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8039",5160,"have my right, the better shall I be pleased.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8040",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8041",5160,"Then they called together the whole of Gwynedd, and set forth to Ardudwy.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8042",5160,"And Gwydion went on before and proceeded to Mur y Castell.  And when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8043",5160,"Blodeuwedd heard that he was coming, she took her maidens with her, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8044",5160,"fled to the mountain.  And they passed through the river Cynvael, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8045",5160,"went towards a court that there was upon the mountain, and through fear","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8046",5160,"they could not proceed except with their faces looking backwards, so that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8047",5160,"unawares they fell into the lake.  And they were all drowned except","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8048",5160,"Blodeuwedd herself, and her Gwydion overtook.  And he said unto her, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8049",5160,"will not slay thee, but I will do unto thee worse than that.  For I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8050",5160,"turn thee into a bird; and because of the shame thou hast done unto Llew","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8051",5160,"Llaw Gyffes, thou shalt never show thy face in the light of day","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8052",5160,"henceforth; and that through fear of all the other birds.  For it shall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8053",5160,"be their nature to attack thee, and to chase thee from wheresoever they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8054",5160,"may find thee.  And thou shalt not lose thy name, but shalt be always","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8055",5160,"called Blodeuwedd.”  Now Blodeuwedd is an owl in the language of this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8056",5160,"present time, and for this reason is the owl hateful unto all birds.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8057",5160,"even now the owl is called Blodeuwedd.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8058",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8059",5160,"Then Gronw Pebyr withdrew unto Penllyn, and he dispatched thence an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8060",5160,"embassy.  And the messengers he sent asked Llew Llaw Gyffes if he would","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8061",5160,"take land, or domain, or gold, or silver, for the injury he had received.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8062",5160,"“I will not, by my confession to Heaven,” said he.  “Behold this is the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8063",5160,"least that I will accept from him; that he come to the spot where I was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8064",5160,"when he wounded me with the dart, and that I stand where he did, and that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8065",5160,"with a dart I take my aim at him.  And this is the very least that I will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8066",5160,"accept.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8067",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8068",5160,"And this was told unto Gronw Pebyr.  “Verily,” said he, “is it needful","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8069",5160,"for me to do thus?  My faithful warriors, and my household, and my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8070",5160,"foster-brothers, is there not one among you who will stand the blow in my","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8071",5160,"stead?”  “There is not, verily,” answered they.  And because of their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8072",5160,"refusal to suffer one stroke for their lord, they are called the third","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8074",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8075",5160,"Then they two went forth to the banks of the river Cynvael, and Gronw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8076",5160,"stood in the place where Llew Llaw Gyffes was when he struck him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8077",5160,"Llew in the place where Gronw was.  Then said Gronw Pebyr unto Llew,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8078",5160,"“Since it was through the wiles of a woman that I did unto thee as I have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8079",5160,"done, I adjure thee by Heaven to let me place between me and the blow,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8080",5160,"the slab thou seest yonder on the river’s bank.”  “Verily,” said Llew, “I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8081",5160,"will not refuse thee this.”  “Ah,” said he, “may Heaven reward thee.”  So","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8082",5160,"Gronw took the slab and placed it between him and the blow.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8083",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8084",5160,"Then Llew flung the dart at him, and it pierced the slab and went through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8085",5160,"Gronw likewise, so that it pierced through his back.  And thus was Gronw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8086",5160,"Pebyr slain.  And there is still the slab on the bank of the river","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8087",5160,"Cynvael, in Ardudwy, having the hole through it.  And therefore is it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8102",5160,"held a council of kings, and he said to his friends, “I desire to go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8103",5160,"to-morrow to hunt.”  And the next day in the morning he set forth with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8117",5160,"journeying along the valley of the river towards its source; and he came","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8118",5160,"to the highest mountain in the world.  And he thought that the mountain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8119",5160,"was as high as the sky; and when he came over the mountain, it seemed to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8120",5160,"him that he went through the fairest and most level regions that man ever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8121",5160,"yet beheld, on the other side of the mountain.  And he saw large and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8122",5160,"mighty rivers descending from the mountain to the sea, and towards the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8123",5160,"mouths of the rivers he proceeded.  And as he journeyed thus, he came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8124",5160,"the mouth of the largest river ever seen.  And he beheld a great city at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8125",5160,"the entrance of the river, and a vast castle in the city, and he saw many","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8126",5160,"high towers of various colours in the castle.  And he saw a fleet at the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8127",5160,"mouth of the river, the largest ever seen.  And he saw one ship among the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8128",5160,"fleet; larger was it by far, and fairer than all the others.  Of such","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8129",5160,"part of the ship as he could see above the water, one plank was gilded","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8130",5160,"and the other silvered over.  He saw a bridge of the bone of a whale from","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8135",5160,"to sea, even to the furthest shore of the island.  Valleys he saw, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8136",5160,"steeps, and rocks of wondrous height, and rugged precipices.  Never yet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8165",5160,"with clasps of red gold at the breast; and a surcoat of gold tissue upon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8166",5160,"her, and a frontlet of red gold upon her head, and rubies and gems were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8167",5160,"in the frontlet, alternating with pearls and imperial stones.  And a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8168",5160,"girdle of ruddy gold was around her.  She was the fairest sight that man","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8169",5160,"ever beheld.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8170",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8171",5160,"The maiden arose from her chair before him, and he threw his arms about","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8172",5160,"the neck of the maiden, and they two sat down together in the chair of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8173",5160,"gold: and the chair was not less roomy for them both, than for the maiden","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8174",5160,"alone.  And as he had his arms about the maiden’s neck, and his cheek by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8175",5160,"her cheek, behold, through the chafing of the dogs at their leashing, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8176",5160,"the clashing of the shields as they struck against each other, and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8177",5160,"beating together of the shafts of the spears, and the neighing of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8178",5160,"horses and their prancing, the emperor awoke.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8179",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8180",5160,"And when he awoke, nor spirit nor existence was left him, because of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8181",5160,"maiden whom he had seen in his sleep, for the love of the maiden pervaded","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8182",5160,"his whole frame.  Then his household spake unto him.  “Lord,” said they,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8183",5160,"“is it not past the time for thee to take thy food?”  Thereupon the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8184",5160,"emperor mounted his palfrey, the saddest man that mortal ever saw, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8185",5160,"went forth towards Rome.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8186",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8187",5160,"And thus he was during the space of a week.  When they of the household","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8188",5160,"went to drink wine and mead out of golden vessels, he went not with any","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8189",5160,"of them.  When they went to listen to songs and tales, he went not with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8190",5160,"them there; neither could he be persuaded to do anything but sleep.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8191",5160,"as often as he slept, he beheld in his dreams the maiden he loved best;","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8192",5160,"but except when he slept he saw nothing of her, for he knew not where in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8193",5160,"the world she was.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8194",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8195",5160,"One day the page of the chamber spake unto him; now, although he was page","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8196",5160,"of the chamber, he was king of the Romans.  “Lord,” said he, “all the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8197",5160,"people revile thee.”  “Wherefore do they revile me?” asked the emperor.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8198",5160,"“Because they can get neither message nor answer from thee as men should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8199",5160,"have from their lord.  This is the cause why thou art spoken evil of.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8200",5160,"“Youth,” said the emperor, “do thou bring unto me the wise men of Rome,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8201",5160,"and I will tell them wherefore I am sorrowful.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8202",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8203",5160,"Then the wise men of Rome were brought to the emperor, and he spake to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8204",5160,"them.  “Sages of Rome,” said he, “I have seen a dream.  And in the dream","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8205",5160,"I beheld a maiden, and because of the maiden is there neither life, nor","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8206",5160,"spirit, nor existence within me.”  “Lord,” they answered, “since thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8207",5160,"judgest us worthy to counsel thee, we will give thee counsel.  And this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8208",5160,"is our counsel; that thou send messengers for three years to the three","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8209",5160,"parts of the world to seek for thy dream.  And as thou knowest not what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8210",5160,"day or what night good news may come to thee, the hope thereof will","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8211",5160,"support thee.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8212",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8213",5160,"So the messengers journeyed for the space of a year, wandering about the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8214",5160,"world, and seeking tidings concerning his dream.  But when they came back","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8215",5160,"at the end of the year, they knew not one word more than they did the day","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8216",5160,"they set forth.  And then was the emperor exceeding sorrowful, for he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8217",5160,"thought that he should never have tidings of her whom best he loved.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8218",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8219",5160,"Then spoke the king of the Romans unto the emperor.  “Lord,” said he, “go","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8220",5160,"forth to hunt by the way thou didst seem to go, whether it were to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8221",5160,"east, or to the west.”  So the emperor went forth to the hunt, and he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8222",5160,"came to the bank of the river.  “Behold,” said he, “this is where I was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8223",5160,"when I saw the dream, and I went towards the source of the river","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8224",5160,"westward.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8225",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8226",5160,"And thereupon thirteen messengers of the emperor’s set forth, and before","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8227",5160,"them they saw a high mountain, which seemed to them to touch the sky.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8228",5160,"Now this was the guise in which the messengers journeyed; one sleeve was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8229",5160,"on the cap of each of them in front, as a sign that they were messengers,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8230",5160,"in order that through what hostile land soever they might pass no harm","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8231",5160,"might be done them.  And when they were come over this mountain, they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8232",5160,"beheld vast plains, and large rivers flowing there through.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8233",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8234",5160,"“Behold,” said they, “the land which our master saw.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8235",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8236",5160,"And they went along the mouths of the rivers, until they came to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8237",5160,"mighty river which they saw flowing to the sea, and the vast city, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8238",5160,"the many-coloured high towers in the castle.  They saw the largest fleet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8239",5160,"in the world, in the harbour of the river, and one ship that was larger","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8240",5160,"than any of the others.  “Behold again,” said they, “the dream that our","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8241",5160,"master saw.”  And in the great ship they crossed the sea, and came to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8242",5160,"Island of Britain.  And they traversed the island until they came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8243",5160,"Snowdon.  “Behold,” said they, “the rugged land that our master saw.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8244",5160,"And they went forward until they saw Anglesey before them, and until they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8245",5160,"saw Arvon likewise.  “Behold,” said they, “the land our master saw in his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8246",5160,"sleep.”  And they saw Aber Sain, and a castle at the mouth of the river.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8247",5160,"The portal of the castle saw they open, and into the castle they went,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8248",5160,"and they saw a hall in the castle.  Then said they, “Behold, the hall","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8249",5160,"which he saw in his sleep.”  They went into the hall, and they beheld two","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8250",5160,"youths playing at chess on the golden bench.  And they beheld the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8251",5160,"hoary-headed man beside the pillar, in the ivory chair, carving chessmen.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8252",5160,"And they beheld the maiden sitting on a chair of ruddy gold.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8253",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8254",5160,"The messengers bent down upon their knees.  “Empress of Rome, all hail!”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8255",5160,"“Ha, gentles,” said the maiden, “ye bear the seeming of honourable men,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8256",5160,"and the badge of envoys, what mockery is this ye do to me?”  “We mock","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8257",5160,"thee not, lady; but the Emperor of Rome hath seen thee in his sleep, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8258",5160,"he has neither life nor spirit left because of thee.  Thou shalt have of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8259",5160,"us therefore the choice, lady, whether thou wilt go with us and be made","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8260",5160,"empress of Rome, or that the emperor come hither and take thee for his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8261",5160,"wife?”  “Ha, lords,” said the maiden, “I will not deny what ye say,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8262",5160,"neither will I believe it too well.  If the emperor love me, let him come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8263",5160,"here to seek me.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8264",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8265",5160,"And by day and night the messengers hied them back.  And when their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8266",5160,"horses failed, they bought other fresh ones.  And when they came to Rome,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8267",5160,"they saluted the emperor, and asked their boon, which was given to them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8268",5160,"according as they named it.  “We will be thy guides, lord,” said they,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8269",5160,"“over sea and over land, to the place where is the woman whom best thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8270",5160,"lovest, for we know her name, and her kindred, and her race.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8271",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8272",5160,"And immediately the emperor set forth with his army.  And these men were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8273",5160,"his guides.  Towards the Island of Britain they went over the sea and the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8274",5160,"deep.  And he conquered the Island from Beli the son of Manogan, and his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8275",5160,"sons, and drove them to the sea, and went forward even unto Arvon.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8276",5160,"the emperor knew the land when he saw it.  And when he beheld the castle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8277",5160,"of Aber Sain, “Look yonder,” said he, “there is the castle wherein I saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8278",5160,"the damsel whom I best love.”  And he went forward into the castle and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8279",5160,"into the hall, and there he saw Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon the son","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8280",5160,"of Eudav, playing at chess.  And he saw Eudav the son of Caradawc,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8281",5160,"sitting on a chair of ivory carving chessmen.  And the maiden whom he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8282",5160,"beheld in his sleep, he saw sitting on a chair of gold.  “Empress of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8283",5160,"Rome,” said he, “all hail!”  And the emperor threw his arms about her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8284",5160,"neck; and that night she became his bride.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8285",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8286",5160,"And the next day in the morning, the damsel asked her maiden portion.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8287",5160,"And he told her to name what she would.  And she asked to have the Island","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8288",5160,"of Britain for her father, from the Channel to the Irish Sea, together","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8289",5160,"with the three adjacent Islands, to hold under the empress of Rome; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8290",5160,"to have three chief castles made for her, an whatever places she might","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8291",5160,"choose in the Island of Britain.  And she chose to have the highest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8292",5160,"castle made at Arvon.  And they brought thither earth from Rome that it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8293",5160,"might be more healthful for the emperor to sleep, and sit, and walk upon.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8294",5160,"After that the two other castles were made for her, which were Caerlleon","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8295",5160,"and Caermarthen.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8296",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8297",5160,"And one day the emperor went to hunt at Caermarthen, and he came so far","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8298",5160,"as the top of Brevi Vawr, and there the emperor pitched his tent.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8299",5160,"that encamping place is called Cadeir Maxen, even to this day.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8300",5160,"because that he built the castle with a myriad of men, he called it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8301",5160,"Caervyrddin.  Then Helen bethought her to make high roads from one castle","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8302",5160,"to another throughout the Island of Britain.  And the roads were made.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8303",5160,"And for this cause are they called the roads of Helen Luyddawc, that she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8304",5160,"was sprung from a native of this island, and the men of the Island of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8305",5160,"Britain would not have made these great roads for any save for her.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8306",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8307",5160,"Seven years did the emperor tarry in this Island.  Now, at that time, the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8308",5160,"men of Rome had a custom, that whatsoever emperor should remain in other","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8309",5160,"lands more than seven years should remain to his own overthrow, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8310",5160,"should never return to Rome again.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8311",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8312",5160,"So they made a new emperor.  And this one wrote a letter of threat to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8313",5160,"Maxen.  There was nought in the letter but only this.  “If thou comest,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8314",5160,"and if thou ever comest to Rome.”  And even unto Caerlleon came this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8315",5160,"letter to Maxen, and these tidings.  Then sent he a letter to the man who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8316",5160,"styled himself emperor in Rome.  There was nought in that letter also but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8317",5160,"only this.  “If I come to Rome, and if I come.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8318",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8319",5160,"And thereupon Maxen set forth towards Rome with his army, and vanquished","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8320",5160,"France and Bugundy, and every land on the way, and sat down before the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8321",5160,"city of Rome.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8322",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8323",5160,"A year was the emperor before the city, and he was no nearer taking it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8324",5160,"than the first day.  And after him there came the brothers of Helen","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8325",5160,"Luyddawc from the Island of Britain, and a small host with them, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8326",5160,"better warriors were in that small host than twice as many Romans.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8327",5160,"the emperor was told that a host was seen, halting close to his army and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8328",5160,"encamping, and no man ever saw a fairer or better appointed host for its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8329",5160,"size, nor more handsome standards.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8330",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8331",5160,"And Helen went to see the hosts, and she knew the standards of her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8332",5160,"brothers.  Then came Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon the son of Eudav,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8333",5160,"to meet the emperor.  And the emperor was glad because of them, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8334",5160,"embraced them.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8335",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8336",5160,"Then they looked at the Romans as they attacked the city.  Said Kynan to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8337",5160,"his brother, “We will try to attack the city more expertly than this.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8338",5160,"So they measured by night the height of the wall, and they sent their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8339",5160,"carpenters to the wood, and a ladder was made for every four men of their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8340",5160,"number.  Now when these were ready, every day at mid-day the emperors","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8341",5160,"went to meat, and they ceased to fight on both sides till all had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8342",5160,"finished eating.  And in the morning the men of Britain took their food","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8343",5160,"and they drank until they were invigorated.  And while the two emperors","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8344",5160,"were at meat, the Britons came to the city, and placed their ladders","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8345",5160,"against it, and forthwith they came in through the city.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8346",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8347",5160,"The new emperor had no time to arm himself when they fell upon him, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8348",5160,"slew him, and many others with him.  And three nights and three days were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8349",5160,"they subduing the men that were in the city and taking the castle.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8350",5160,"others of them kept the city, lest any of the host of Maxen should come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8351",5160,"therein, until they had subjected all to their will.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8352",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8353",5160,"Then spake Maxen to Helen Luyddawc.  “I marvel, lady,” said he, “that thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8354",5160,"brothers have not conquered this city for me.”  “Lord, emperor,” she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8355",5160,"answered, “the wisest youths in the world are my brothers.  Go thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8356",5160,"thither and ask the city of them, and if it be in their possession thou","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8357",5160,"shalt have it gladly.”  So the emperor and Helen went and demanded the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8358",5160,"city.  And they told the emperor that none had taken the city, and that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8359",5160,"none could give it him, but the men of the Island of Britain.  Then the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8360",5160,"gates of the city of Rome were opened, and the emperor sat on the throne,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8361",5160,"and all the men of Rome submitted them selves unto him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8362",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8363",5160,"The emperor then said unto Kynan and Adeon, “Lords,” said he, “I have now","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8424",5160,"first was a certain race that came, and was called the Coranians; and so","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8425",5160,"great was their knowledge, that there was no discourse upon the face of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8426",5160,"the Island, however low it might be spoken, but what, if the wind met it,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8428",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8429",5160,"The second plague was a shriek which came on every May-eve, over every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8431",5160,"and so scared them, that the men lost their hue and their strength, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8438",5160,"provision of meat and drink, none of it could ever be found, except what","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8442",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8445",5160,"the nobles of his kingdom, and asked counsel of them what they should do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8446",5160,"against these afflictions.  And by the common counsel of the nobles,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8447",5160,"Lludd the son of Beli went to Llevelys his brother, king of France, for","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8449",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8450",5160,"And they made ready a fleet, and that in secret and in silence, lest that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8453",5160,"ships, Lludd and those whom he chose with him.  And they began to cleave","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8458",5160,"with him was a fleet vast of size.  And when Lludd saw this, he left all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8459",5160,"the ships out upon the sea except one only; and in that one he came to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8460",5160,"meet his brother, and he likewise with a single ship came to meet him.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8461",5160,"And when they were come together, each put his arms about the other’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8463",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8464",5160,"After that Lludd had shown his brother the cause of his errand, Llevelys","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8465",5160,"said that he himself knew the cause of the coming to those lands.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8466",5160,"they took counsel together to discourse on the matter otherwise than","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8467",5160,"thus, in order that the wind might not catch their words, nor the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8468",5160,"Coranians know what they might say.  Then Llevelys caused a long horn to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8469",5160,"be made of brass, and through this horn they discoursed.  But whatsoever","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8470",5160,"words they spoke through this horn, one to the other, neither of them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8471",5160,"could hear any other but harsh and hostile words.  And when Llevelys saw","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8472",5160,"this, and that there was a demon thwarting them and disturbing through","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8473",5160,"this horn, he caused wine to be put therein to wash it.  And through the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8474",5160,"virtue of the wine the demon was driven out of the horn.  And when their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8475",5160,"discourse was unobstructed, Llevelys told his brother that he would give","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8476",5160,"him some insects whereof he should keep some to breed, lest by chance the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8477",5160,"like affliction might come a second time.  And other of these insects he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8478",5160,"should take and bruise in water.  And he assured him that it would have","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8479",5160,"power to destroy the race of the Coranians.  That is to say, that when he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8480",5160,"came home to his kingdom he should call together all the people both of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8481",5160,"his own race and of the race of the Coranians for a conference, as though","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8482",5160,"with the intent of making peace between them; and that when they were all","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8483",5160,"together, he should take this charmed water, and cast it over all alike.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8484",5160,"And he assured him that the water would poison the race of the Coranians,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8486",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8487",5160,"“And the second plague,” said he, “that is in thy dominion, behold it is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8489",5160,"striving to overcome it.  And therefore does your dragon make a fearful","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8490",5160,"outcry.  And on this wise mayest thou come to know this.  After thou hast","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8491",5160,"returned home, cause the Island to be measured in its length and breadth,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8492",5160,"and in the place where thou dost find the exact central point, there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8493",5160,"cause a pit to be dug, and cause a cauldron full of the best mead that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8494",5160,"can be made to be put in the pit, with a covering of satin over the face","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8495",5160,"of the cauldron.  And then, in thine own person do thou remain there","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8496",5160,"watching, and thou wilt see the dragon fighting in the form of terrific","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8497",5160,"animals.  And at length they will take the form of dragons in the air.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8498",5160,"And last of all, after wearying themselves with fierce and furious","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8499",5160,"fighting, they will fall in the form of two pigs upon the covering, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8500",5160,"they will sink in, and the covering with them, and they will draw it down","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8501",5160,"to the very bottom of the cauldron.  And they will drink up the whole of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8502",5160,"the mead; and after that they will sleep.  Thereupon do thou immediately","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8503",5160,"fold the covering around them, and bury them in a kistvaen, in the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8504",5160,"strongest place thou hast in thy dominions, and hide them in the earth.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8505",5160,"And as long as they shall bide in that strong place no plague shall come","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8507",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8508",5160,"“The cause of the third plague,” said he, “is a mighty man of magic, who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8509",5160,"take thy meat and thy drink and thy store.  And he through illusions and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8510",5160,"charms causes every one to sleep.  Therefore it is needful for thee in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8511",5160,"thy own person to watch thy food and thy provisions.  And lest he should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8512",5160,"overcome thee with sleep, be there a cauldron of cold water by thy side,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8513",5160,"and when thou art oppressed with sleep, plunge into the cauldron.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8514",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8515",5160,"Then Lludd returned back unto his land.  And immediately he summoned to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8516",5160,"him the whole of his own race and of the Coranians.  And as Llevelys had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8517",5160,"taught him, he bruised the insects in water, the which he cast over them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8518",5160,"all together, and forthwith it destroyed the whole tribe of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8519",5160,"Coranians, without hurt to any of the Britons.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8520",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8521",5160,"And some time after this, Lludd caused the Island to be measured in its","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8522",5160,"length and in its breadth.  And in Oxford he found the central point, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8523",5160,"in that place he caused the earth to be dug, and in that pit a cauldron","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8524",5160,"to be set, full of the best mead that could be made, and a covering of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8525",5160,"satin over the face of it.  And he himself watched that night.  And while","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8526",5160,"he was there, he beheld the dragons fighting.  And when they were weary","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8527",5160,"they fell, and came down upon the top of the satin, and drew it with them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8528",5160,"to the bottom of the cauldron.  And when they had drunk the mead they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8529",5160,"slept.  And in their sleep, Lludd folded the covering around them, and in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8530",5160,"the securest place he had in Snowdon, he hid them in a kistvaen.  Now","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8531",5160,"after that this spot was called Dinas Emreis, but before that, Dinas","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8532",5160,"Ffaraon.  And thus the fierce outcry ceased in his dominions.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8533",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8534",5160,"And when this was ended, King Lludd caused an exceeding great banquet to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8535",5160,"be prepared.  And when it was ready, he placed a vessel of cold water by","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8536",5160,"his side, and he in his own proper person watched it.  And as he abode","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8537",5160,"thus clad with arms, about the third watch of the night, lo, he heard","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8538",5160,"many surpassing fascinations and various songs.  And drowsiness urged him","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8539",5160,"to sleep.  Upon this, lest he should be hindered from his purpose and be","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8540",5160,"overcome by sleep, he went often into the water.  And at last, behold, a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8541",5160,"man of vast size, clad in strong, heavy armour, came in, bearing a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8542",5160,"hamper.  And, as he was wont, he put all the food and provisions of meat","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8543",5160,"and drink into the hamper, and proceeded to go with it forth.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8544",5160,"nothing was ever more wonderful to Lludd, than that the hamper should","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8545",5160,"hold so much.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8546",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8547",5160,"And thereupon King Lludd went after him and spoke unto him thus.  “Stop,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8548",5160,"stop,” said he, “though thou hast done many insults and much spoil","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8549",5160,"erewhile, thou shalt not do so any more, unless thy skill in arms and thy","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8551",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8552",5160,"Then he instantly put down the hamper on the floor, and awaited him.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8553",5160,"a fierce encounter was between them, so that the glittering fire flew out","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8554",5160,"from their arms.  And at the last Lludd grappled with him, and fate","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8555",5160,"bestowed the victory on Lludd.  And he threw the plague to the earth.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8556",5160,"And after he had overcome him by strength and might, he besought his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8557",5160,"mercy.  “How can I grant thee mercy,” said the king, “after all the many","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8558",5160,"injuries and wrongs that thou hast done me?”  “All the losses that ever I","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8599",5160,"end of the year, as Caridwen was culling plants and making incantations,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8600",5160,"it chanced that three drops of the charmed liquor flew out of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8603",5160,"marvel-working drops into his mouth, he foresaw everything that was to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8605",5160,"wiles of Caridwen, for vast was her skill.  And in very great fear he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8607",5160,"the liquor within it except the three charm-bearing drops was poisonous,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8623",5160,"in the form of an otter-bitch chased him under the water, until he was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8626",5160,"upon him, and he was in fear of death, he espied a heap of winnowed wheat","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8629",5160,"high-crested black hen, and went to the wheat and scratched it with her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8640",5160,"And it grieved his father sore, for he thought that he was born in an","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8648",5160,"unlucky until to-night, and now thou hast destroyed the virtues of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8650",5160,"and to-night there is nothing but this leathern skin within it.”  “How","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8652",5160,"Well, they took up the leathern bag, and he who opened it saw the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8778",5160,"And with this they put questions one to another amongst themselves: Who","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8779",5160,"had braver men?  Who had fairer or swifter horses or greyhounds?  Who had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8780",5160,"more skilful or wiser bards—than Maelgwn?","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8781",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8782",5160,"Now at that time the bards were in great favour with the exalted of the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8784",5160,"heralds, unless they were learned men, not only expert in the service of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8785",5160,"kings and princes, but studious and well versed in the lineage, and arms,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8788",5160,"annals of the first nobles; and also were prepared always with their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8789",5160,"answers in various languages, Latin, French, Welsh, and English.  And","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8790",5160,"together with this they were great chroniclers, and recorders, and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8791",5160,"skilful in framing verses, and ready in making englyns in every one of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8792",5160,"those languages.  Now of these there were at that feast within the palace","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8793",5160,"of Maelgwn as many as four-and-twenty, and chief of them all was one","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8794",5160,"named Heinin Vardd.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8795",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8796",5160,"When they had all made an end of thus praising the king and his gifts, it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8797",5160,"befell that Elphin spoke in this wise.  “Of a truth none but a king may","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8798",5160,"vie with a king; but were he not a king, I would say that my wife was as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8799",5160,"virtuous as any lady in the kingdom, and also that I have a bard who is","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8800",5160,"more skilful than all the king’s bards.”  In a short space some of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8801",5160,"fellows showed the king all the boastings of Elphin; and the king ordered","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8802",5160,"him to be thrown into a strong prison, until he might know the truth as","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8803",5160,"to the virtues of his wife, and the wisdom of his bard.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8804",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8805",5160,"Now when Elphin had been put in a tower of the castle, with a thick chain","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8806",5160,"about his feet (it is said that it was a silver chain, because he was of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8807",5160,"royal blood), the king, as the story relates, sent his son Rhun to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8808",5160,"inquire into the demeanour of Elphin’s wife.  Now Rhun was the most","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8809",5160,"graceless man in the world, and there was neither wife nor maiden with","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8810",5160,"whom he had held converse, but was evil spoken of.  While Rhun went in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8811",5160,"haste towards Elphin’s dwelling, being fully minded to bring disgrace","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8812",5160,"upon his wife, Taliesin told his mistress how that the king had placed","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8813",5160,"his master in durance in prison, and how that Rhun was coming in haste to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8814",5160,"strive to bring disgrace upon her.  Wherefore he caused his mistress to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8815",5160,"array one of the maids of her kitchen in her apparel; which the noble","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8816",5160,"lady gladly did; and she loaded her hands with the best rings that she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8817",5160,"and her husband possessed.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8818",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8819",5160,"In this guise Taliesin caused his mistress to put the maiden to sit at","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8820",5160,"the board in her room at supper, and he made her to seem as her mistress,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8821",5160,"and the mistress to seem as the maid.  And when they were in due time","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8822",5160,"seated at their supper in the manner that has been said, Rhun suddenly","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8823",5160,"arrived at Elphin’s dwelling, and was received with joy, for all the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8824",5160,"servants knew him plainly; and they brought him in haste to the room of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8825",5160,"their mistress, in the semblance of whom the maid rose up from supper and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8826",5160,"welcomed him gladly.  And afterwards she sat down to supper again the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8827",5160,"second time, and Rhun with her.  Then Rhun began jesting with the maid,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8828",5160,"who still kept the semblance of her mistress.  And verily this story","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8829",5160,"shows that the maiden became so intoxicated, that she fell asleep; and","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8830",5160,"the story relates that it was a powder that Rhun put into the drink, that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8831",5160,"made her sleep so soundly that she never felt it when he cut from off her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8832",5160,"hand her little finger, whereupon was the signet ring of Elphin, which he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8833",5160,"had sent to his wife as a token, a short time before.  And Rhun returned","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8834",5160,"to the king with the finger and the ring as a proof, to show that he had","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8835",5160,"cut it from off her hand, without her awaking from her sleep of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8836",5160,"intemperance.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8837",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8838",5160,"The king rejoiced greatly at these tidings, and he sent for his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8839",5160,"councillors, to whom he told the whole story from the beginning.  And he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8840",5160,"caused Elphin to be brought out of his prison, and he chided him because","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8841",5160,"of his boast.  And he spake unto Elphin on this wise.  “Elphin, be it","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8842",5160,"known to thee beyond a doubt that it is but folly for a man to trust in","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8843",5160,"the virtues of his wife further than he can see her; and that thou mayest","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8844",5160,"be certain of thy wife’s vileness, behold her finger, with thy signet","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8845",5160,"ring upon it, which was cut from her hand last night, while she slept the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8846",5160,"sleep of intoxication.”  Then thus spake Elphin.  “With thy leave, mighty","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8847",5160,"king, I cannot deny my ring, for it is known of many; but verily I assert","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8848",5160,"strongly that the finger around which it is, was never attached to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8849",5160,"hand of my wife, for in truth and certainty there are three notable","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8850",5160,"things pertaining to it, none of which ever belonged to any of my wife’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8851",5160,"fingers.  The first of the three is, that it is certain, by your grace’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8852",5160,"leave, that wheresoever my wife is at this present hour, whether sitting,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8853",5160,"or standing, or lying down, this ring would never remain upon her thumb,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8854",5160,"whereas you can plainly see that it was hard to draw it over the joint of","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8855",5160,"the little finger of the hand whence this was cut; the second thing is,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8856",5160,"that my wife has never let pass one Saturday since I have known her","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8857",5160,"without paring her nails before going to bed, and you can see fully that","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8858",5160,"the nail of this little finger has not been pared for a month.  The third","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8859",5160,"is, truly, that the hand whence this finger came was kneading rye dough","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8860",5160,"within three days before the finger was cut therefrom, and I can assure","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8861",5160,"your goodness that my wife has never kneaded rye dough since my wife she","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8862",5160,"has been.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8863",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8864",5160,"Then the king was mightily wroth with Elphin for so stoutly withstanding","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8865",5160,"him, respecting the goodness of his wife, wherefore he ordered him to his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8866",5160,"prison a second time, saying that he should not be loosed thence until he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8867",5160,"had proved the truth of his boast, as well concerning the wisdom of his","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8868",5160,"bard as the virtues of his wife.","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8869",5160,"","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8870",5160,"In the meantime his wife and Taliesin remained joyful at Elphin’s","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8871",5160,"dwelling.  And Taliesin showed his mistress how that Elphin was in prison","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8872",5160,"because of them, but he bade her be glad, for that he would go to","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8873",5160,"Maelgwn’s court to free his master.  Then she asked him in what manner he","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"

"8926",5160,"of Maelgwn, who was going to sit in his hall and dine in his royal state,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8927",5160,"as it was the custom in those days for kings and princes to do at every","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8928",5160,"chief feast.  And as soon as Taliesin entered the hall, he placed himself","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8929",5160,"in a quiet corner, near the place where the bards and the minstrels were","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8930",5160,"wont to come in doing their service and duty to the king, as is the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8931",5160,"custom at the high festivals when the bounty is proclaimed.  And so, when","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8932",5160,"the bards and the heralds came to cry largess, and to proclaim the power","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8933",5160,"of the king and his strength, at the moment that they passed by the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8934",5160,"corner wherein he was crouching, Taliesin pouted out his lips after them,","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8935",5160,"and played “Blerwm, blerwm,” with his finger upon his lips.  Neither took","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8936",5160,"they much notice of him as they went by, but proceeded forward till they","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8937",5160,"came before the king, unto whom they made their obeisance with their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8938",5160,"bodies, as they were wont, without speaking a single word, but pouting","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8939",5160,"out their lips, and making mouths at the king, playing “Blerwm, blerwm,”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8940",5160,"upon their lips with their fingers, as they had seen the boy do","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8941",5160,"elsewhere.  This sight caused the king to wonder and to deem within","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8942",5160,"himself that they were drunk with many liquors.  Wherefore he commanded","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8943",5160,"one of his lords, who served at the board, to go to them and desire them","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8944",5160,"to collect their wits, and to consider where they stood, and what it was","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8945",5160,"fitting for them to do.  And this lord did so gladly.  But they ceased","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8946",5160,"not from their folly any more than before.  Whereupon he sent to them a","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8947",5160,"second time, and a third, desiring them to go forth from the hall.  At","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8948",5160,"the last the king ordered one of his squires to give a blow to the chief","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8949",5160,"of them named Heinin Vardd; and the squire took a broom and struck him on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8950",5160,"the head, so that he fell back in his seat.  Then he arose and went on","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8951",5160,"his knees, and besought leave of the king’s grace to show that this their","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8952",5160,"fault was not through want of knowledge, neither through drunkenness, but","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8953",5160,"by the influence of some spirit that was in the hall.  And after this","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8954",5160,"Heinin spoke on this wise.  “Oh, honourable king, be it known to your","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8955",5160,"grace, that not from the strength of drink, or of too much liquor, are we","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8956",5160,"dumb, without power of speech like drunken men, but through the influence","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8957",5160,"of a spirit that sits in the corner yonder in the form of a child.”","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
"8958",5160,"Forthwith the king commanded the squire to fetch him; and he went to the","The Mabinogion",NA,"Fantasy","en"
