"3202",552,"in my direction.  At last it became evident that he was doing so, when","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3203",552,"apparently without cause, the filly raised her head, neighed and","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3204",552,"started off at a trot in the opposite direction, immediately followed,","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3205",552,"of course, by the colts and my stallion.  It looked for a moment as","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3206",552,"though my last hope was blasted; but presently their fright, if fright","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3207",552,"it was, passed, and they resumed grazing again a hundred yards farther","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3208",552,"on.  This time there was no bush within fifty feet of them, and I was","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3209",552,"at a loss as to how to get within safe roping-distance.  Anywhere under","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3214",552,"As I stood debating the question in my mind, I was almost upon the","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3215",552,"point of making the attempt at the long throw.  I had plenty of rope,","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3216",552,"this Galu weapon being fully sixty feet long.  How I wished for the","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3217",552,"collies from the ranch!  At a word they would have circled this little","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3218",552,"bunch and driven it straight down to me; and then it flashed into my","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3219",552,"mind that Nobs had run with those collies all one summer, that he had","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3220",552,"gone down to the pasture with them after the cows every evening and","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3221",552,"done his part in driving them back to the milking-barn, and had done it","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3222",552,"intelligently; but Nobs had never done the thing alone, and it had been","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3223",552,"a year since he had done it at all.  However, the chances were more in","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3224",552,"favor of my foozling the long throw than that Nobs would fall down in","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3226",552,"","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3229",552,"Here we could see directly through the bush, and pointing the animals","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3235",552,"berth they stopped again, though they stood watching him, with","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3236",552,"high-held heads and quivering nostrils.  It was a beautiful sight.  And","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3237",552,"then Nobs turned in behind them and trotted slowly back toward me.  He","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3238",552,"did not bark, nor come rushing down upon them, and when he had come","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3239",552,"closer to them, he proceeded at a walk.  The splendid creatures seemed","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3240",552,"more curious than fearful, making no effort to escape until Nobs was","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3241",552,"quite close to them; then they trotted slowly away, but at right angles.","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3242",552,"","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3243",552,"And now the fun and trouble commenced.  Nobs, of course, attempted to","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3244",552,"turn them, and he seemed to have selected the stallion to work upon,","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3245",552,"for he paid no attention to the others, having intelligence enough to","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3247",552,"four horses that didn't wish to be rounded up.  The stallion, however,","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3248",552,"had notions of his own about being headed, and the result was as pretty","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3249",552,"a race as one would care to see.  Gad, how that horse could run!  He","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3250",552,"seemed to flatten out and shoot through the air with the very minimum","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3254",552,"each time he was hurled heels over head by the impact; yet before they","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3255",552,"disappeared over a rise in the ground I was sure that Nobs' persistence","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3256",552,"was bearing fruit; it seemed to me that the horse was giving way a","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3257",552,"trifle to the right.  Nobs was between him and the main herd, to which","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3261",552,"chances should I be attacked by some formidable beast.  I was some","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3262",552,"distance from the forest and armed with weapons in the use of which I","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3263",552,"was quite untrained, though I had practiced some with the spear since","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3264",552,"leaving the Kro-lu country.  I must admit that my thoughts were not","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3265",552,"pleasant ones, verging almost upon cowardice, until I chanced to think","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3266",552,"of little Ajor alone in this same land and armed only with a knife!  I","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3267",552,"was immediately filled with shame; but in thinking the matter over","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3268",552,"since, I have come to the conclusion that my state of mind was","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3269",552,"influenced largely by my approximate nakedness.  If you have never","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3270",552,"wandered about in broad daylight garbed in a bit of red-deer skin in","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3271",552,"inadequate length, you can have no conception of the sensation of","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3272",552,"futility that overwhelms one.  Clothes, to a man accustomed to wearing","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3273",552,"clothes, impart a certain self-confidence; lack of them induces panic.","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3274",552,"","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3275",552,"But no beast attacked me, though I saw several menacing forms passing","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3276",552,"through the dark aisles of the forest.  At last I commenced to worry","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3277",552,"over Nobs' protracted absence and to fear that something had befallen","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3278",552,"him.  I was coiling my rope to start out in search of him, when I saw","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3279",552,"the stallion leap into view at almost the same spot behind which he had","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3280",552,"disappeared, and at his heels ran Nobs.  Neither was running so fast or","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3281",552,"furiously as when last I had seen them.","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3283",552,"The horse, as he approached me, I could see was laboring hard; yet he","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3284",552,"kept gamely to his task, and Nobs, too.  The splendid fellow was","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3285",552,"driving the quarry straight toward me.  I crouched behind my bush and","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3286",552,"laid my noose in readiness to throw.  As the two approached my","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3287",552,"hiding-place, Nobs reduced his speed, and the stallion, evidently only","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3288",552,"too glad of the respite, dropped into a trot.  It was at this gait that","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3289",552,"he passed me; my rope-hand flew forward; the honda, well down, held the","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3290",552,"noose open, and the beautiful bay fairly ran his head into it.","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3291",552,"","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3292",552,"Instantly he wheeled to dash off at right angles.  I braced myself with","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3293",552,"the rope around my hip and brought him to a sudden stand.  Rearing and","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3294",552,"struggling, he fought for his liberty while Nobs, panting and with","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3295",552,"lolling tongue, came and threw himself down near me.  He seemed to know","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3296",552,"that his work was done and that he had earned his rest.  The stallion","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3297",552,"was pretty well spent, and after a few minutes of struggling he stood","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3298",552,"with feet far spread, nostrils dilated and eyes wide, watching me as I","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3299",552,"edged toward him, taking in the slack of the rope as I advanced.  A","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3300",552,"dozen times he reared and tried to break away; but always I spoke","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3301",552,"soothingly to him and after an hour of effort I succeeded in reaching","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3302",552,"his head and stroking his muzzle.  Then I gathered a handful of grass","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3303",552,"and offered it to him, and always I talked to him in a quiet and","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3306",552,"I had expected a battle royal; but on the contrary I found his taming a","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3307",552,"matter of comparative ease.  Though wild, he was gentle to a degree,","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3308",552,"and of such remarkable intelligence that he soon discovered that I had","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3309",552,"no intention of harming him.  After that, all was easy.  Before that","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3310",552,"day was done, I had taught him to lead and to stand while I stroked his","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3311",552,"head and flanks, and to eat from my hand, and had the satisfaction of","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3312",552,"seeing the light of fear die in his large, intelligent eyes.","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3316",552,"a struggle of titanic proportions in which I was none too sure that he","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3317",552,"would not come off victor; but he never made the slightest effort to","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3318",552,"unseat me, and from then on his education was rapid.  No horse ever","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3319",552,"learned more quickly the meaning of the rein and the pressure of the","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3350",552,"the foremost pursuer discovered us and set up such a howl as I never","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3351",552,"before have heard.  They were all Galus, and I soon recognized the","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3352",552,"foremost as Du-seen.  He was almost upon Ajor now, and with a sense of","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3353",552,"terror such as I had never before experienced, I saw that he ran with","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3354",552,"his knife in his hand, and that his intention was to slay rather than","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3362",552,"leaning down to the left, swept my little barbarian into the hollow of","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3363",552,"an arm and up on the withers of my glorious Ace.  We had snatched her","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"3364",552,"from the very clutches of Du-seen, who halted, mystified and raging.","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3373",552,"were thrown far over his head.  He had run into one of those numerous","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"3376",552,"with lush grasses which effectually hid its treacherous identity.  It","The People That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
