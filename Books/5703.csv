"620",5703,"Smith spied a long work-bench under a nearby window. There they found a","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"623",5703,"lay several tools, some familiar to the engineer and some entirely","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"624",5703,"strange. A set of screw-drivers of various sizes caught his eye. He","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"625",5703,"picked them up, and again experienced the sensation of having wood turn","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"627",5703,"","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"628",5703,"Still searching, the engineer found a square metal chest of drawers,","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"630",5703,"he brushed this off and disclosed a quantity of exceedingly delicate","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"634",5703,"One drawer held what appeared to be a roll of drawings. Smith did not","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"643",5703,"three. These were small reels, about two inches in diameter and a","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"644",5703,"quarter of an inch thick, each incased in a tight-fitting box. They","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"645",5703,"resembled measuring tapes to some extent, except that the ribbons were","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"646",5703,"made of marvelously thin material. Van Emmon guessed that there were a","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"647",5703,"hundred yards in a roll. Smith estimated it at three hundred. They","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"913",5703,"was a tiny, gelatinlike globule; among scientists it is known as the","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"1006",5703,"dividing walls they had found in the library. Here, however, each","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"1008",5703,"fact, as the three noted with a growing uneasiness, it was necessary to","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"1009",5703,"pass through every one of them in order to reach the corner farthest,","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"1029",5703,"stairs. They were not sorry that they had reached the uppermost floor of","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"1030",5703,"the mansion. It was somewhat better lighted than the floor below, and","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2483",5703,"passageway made a turn just beyond; and by craning my neck and straining","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2484",5703,"my eyes I could see a faintly lighted chamber just a few feet away.","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2487",5703,"the middle of the place, a voice came to my ear.","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2488",5703,"","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2490",5703,"the tones of Edam, the young dreamer whom Maka had brought to my house.","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2537",5703,"softly, preparing to slip through the opening I had made. ""Surely ye","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2547",5703,"away from before my grasp. Next second I was gazing stupidly at the","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2548",5703,"rushing, swirling water of the flume.","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2549",5703,"","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2550",5703,"And I saw that they had been sitting in the cabin of a tiny boat, and","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2553",5703,"There was an opening into the outer air; I rushed through, and stared in","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2554",5703,"the growing twilight down the black furrow of the flume. Far in the","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2555",5703,"distance, and going like a streak, I spied the glittering glass windows","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2556",5703,"of the little craft. Once I made out the flutter of a saucy hand.","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2557",5703,"","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2558",5703,"""We shall get them when they reach the valley!"" I shouted to the men.","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2559",5703,"Then I reached for my tube, and sighted it on the lower end of the","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2560",5703,"flume, far, far below, almost too far away to be clear to the naked eye.","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2562",5703,"In an incredibly short time the craft reached the end. It traveled at an","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2563",5703,"extraordinary rate; perchance 'twas weighted; I marveled that its","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2564",5703,"windows could stand the force of the air. And I scarce had time to fear","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2567",5703,"","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2568",5703,"And then an awesome thing happened. As the boat struck the incline it","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2569",5703,"shot upward into the air at a steep slant. Up, up it went; my heart","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2570",5703,"jumped into my mouth; for surely they must be crushed when they came","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2572",5703,"","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2574",5703,"scarcely slackened; 'twas like that of a shooting star. And in far less","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2575",5703,"time than it takes to tell it, the little boat was high up among the","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2576",5703,"stars, going higher every instant, and farther away from me. And","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2577",5703,"suddenly the sweat broke cold on my forehead; for dead ahead, directly","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2623",5703,"details; I will relate just the outstanding facts. What I did was to","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2624",5703,"select a very tall mountain, located almost on the equator, and","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2625",5703,"proclaimed my intention to erect a monument to Jon upon its summit. I","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2626",5703,"caused vast quanities of materials to be brought to the place; and for a","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2627",5703,"year a hundred thousand men labored to put the pieces together.","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2629",5703,"When they had finished, they had made a mammoth tower partly of wood and","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2630",5703,"partly of alloy. It was made in sections so that it might be placed,","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2897",5703,"consider whether he was the right man for such an excursion. Personally,","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2898",5703,"he hated travel. He was merely a general practitioner, with a great","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2899",5703,"fondness for astronomy; and the sole reason why he wanted to visit the","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2906",5703,"highly commonplace face; he had had considerable experience with human","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2907",5703,"contrariness, and felt sure that Smith must be an absolute wonder, since","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2912",5703,"to fitting the outfit into a suitable sky-car, Kinney was obliged to","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2913",5703,"call in an architect. That accounts for E. Williams Jackson. At the same","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2914",5703,"time, it occurred to the doctor that they would need a cook. Mrs. Kinney","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3465",5703,"curves did not leave his lips; they, however, were thin rather than","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3467",5703,"eyes, set far apart above quite shallow cheekbones, were exceedingly","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3468",5703,"large and of a brilliant blue. In fact, it was mainly his eyes that gave","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3470",5703,"forehead, running back to a cranium that fairly bulged over the ears,","The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
