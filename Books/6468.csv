"4318",6468,"but a narrow streak--a sort of an island on the glacier. They had","On a Torn-Away World; Or, the Captives of the Great Earthquake","Rockwood, Roy","Science Fiction","en"
"4319",6468,"carried the bear meat out to a small sink in the ice where there were","On a Torn-Away World; Or, the Captives of the Great Earthquake","Rockwood, Roy","Science Fiction","en"
