"210",7477,"patronized by the lofty and elect, for he stole nothing smaller than","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"211",7477,"the Moomoo's egg, and in all his life stole only four kinds of","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"212",7477,"stone--the ruby, the diamond, the emerald, and the sapphire; and, as","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"213",7477,"jewellers go, his honesty was great. Now there was a Merchant Prince","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"214",7477,"who had come to Thangobrind and had offered his daughter's soul for","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"215",7477,"the diamond that is larger than the human head and was to be found on","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"216",7477,"the lap of the spider-idol, Hlo-hlo, in his temple of Moung-ga-ling;","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"217",7477,"for he had heard that Thangobrind was a thief to be trusted.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"218",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"219",7477,"Thangobrind oiled his body and slipped out of his shop, and went","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"220",7477,"secretly through byways, and got as far as Snarp, before anybody knew","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"221",7477,"that he was out on business again or missed his sword from its place","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"222",7477,"under the counter. Thence he moved only by night, hiding by day and","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"223",7477,"rubbing the edges of his sword, which he called Mouse because it was","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"224",7477,"swift and nimble. The jeweller had subtle methods of travelling;","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"225",7477,"nobody saw him cross the plains of Zid; nobody saw him come to Mursk","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"226",7477,"or Tlun. O, but he loved shadows! Once the moon peeping out","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"227",7477,"unexpectedly from a tempest had betrayed an ordinary jeweller; not so","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"228",7477,"did it undo Thangobrind: the watchman only saw a crouching shape that","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"229",7477,"snarled and laughed: ""'Tis but a hyena,"" they said. Once in the city","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"230",7477,"of Ag one of the guardians seized him, but Thangobrind was oiled and","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"231",7477,"slipped from his hand; you scarcely heard his bare feet patter away.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"232",7477,"He knew that the Merchant Prince awaited his return, his little eyes","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"233",7477,"open all night and glittering with greed; he knew how his daughter lay","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"234",7477,"chained up and screaming night and day. Ah, Thangobrind knew. And had","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"235",7477,"he not been out on business he had almost allowed himself one or two","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"236",7477,"little laughs. But business was business, and the diamond that he","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"237",7477,"sought still lay on the lap of Hlo-hlo, where it had been for the last","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"238",7477,"two million years since Hlo-hlo created the world and gave unto it all","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"239",7477,"things except that precious stone called Dead Man's Diamond. The jewel","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"240",7477,"was often stolen, but it had a knack of coming back again to the lap","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"241",7477,"of Hlo-hlo. Thangobrind knew this, but he was no common jeweller and","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"242",7477,"hoped to outwit Hlo-hlo, perceiving not the trend of ambition and lust","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"243",7477,"and that they are vanity.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"244",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"245",7477,"How nimbly he threaded his way through he pits of Snood!--now like a","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"246",7477,"botanist, scrutinising the ground; now like a dancer, leaping from","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"247",7477,"crumbling edges. It was quite dark when he went by the towers of Tor,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"248",7477,"where archers shoot ivory arrows at strangers lest any foreigner should","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"249",7477,"alter their laws, which are bad, but not to be altered by mere aliens.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"250",7477,"At night they shoot by the sound of the strangers' feet. O, Thangobrind,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"251",7477,"Thangobrind, was ever a jeweller like you! He dragged two stones behind","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"252",7477,"him by long cords, and at these the archers shot. Tempting indeed was","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"253",7477,"the snare that they set in Woth, the emeralds loose-set in the city's","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"254",7477,"gate; but Thangobrind discerned the golden cord that climbed the wall","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"255",7477,"from each and the weights that would topple upon him if he touched one,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"256",7477,"and so he left them, though he left them weeping, and at last came to","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"257",7477,"Theth. There all men worship Hlo-hlo; though they are willing to believe","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"258",7477,"in other gods, as missionaries attest, but only as creatures of the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"260",7477,"say, on golden hooks along his hunting-belt. And from Theth he came to","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"261",7477,"the city of Moung and the temple of Moung-ga-ling, and entered and saw","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"262",7477,"the spider-idol, Hlo-hlo, sitting there with Dead Man's Diamond","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"263",7477,"glittering on his lap, and looking for all the world like a full moon,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"264",7477,"but a full moon seen by a lunatic who had slept too long in its rays,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"265",7477,"for there was in Dead Man's Diamond a certain sinister look and a boding","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"266",7477,"of things to happen that are better not mentioned here. The face of the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"267",7477,"spider-idol was lit by that fatal gem; there was no other light. In","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"268",7477,"spite of his shocking limbs and that demoniac body, his face was serene","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"269",7477,"and apparently unconscious.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"270",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"271",7477,"A little fear came into the mind of Thangobrind the jeweller, a","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"272",7477,"passing tremor--no more; business was business and he hoped for the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"273",7477,"best. Thangobrind offered honey to Hlo-hlo and prostrated himself","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"274",7477,"before him. Oh, he was cunning! When the priests stole out of the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"275",7477,"darkness to lap up the honey they were stretched senseless on the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"276",7477,"temple floor, for there was a drug in the honey that was offered to","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"277",7477,"Hlo-hlo. And Thangobrind the jeweller picked Dead Man's Diamond up and","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"278",7477,"put it on his shoulder and trudged away from the shrine; and Hlo-hlo","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"279",7477,"the spider-idol said nothing at all, but he laughed softly as the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"280",7477,"jeweller shut the door. When the priests awoke out of the grip of the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"281",7477,"drug that was offered with the honey to Hlo-hlo, they rushed to a","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"282",7477,"little secret room with an outlet on the stars and cast a horoscope of","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"283",7477,"the thief. Something that they saw in the horoscope seemed to satisfy","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"284",7477,"the priests.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"286",7477,"It was not like Thangobrind to go back by the road by which he had","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"287",7477,"come. No, he went by another road, even though it led to the narrow","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"288",7477,"way, night-house and spider-forest.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"289",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"290",7477,"The city of Moung went towering by behind him, balcony above balcony,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"291",7477,"eclipsing half the stars, as he trudged away with his diamond. Though","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"292",7477,"when a soft pittering as of velvet feet arose behind him he refused to","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"293",7477,"acknowledge that it might be what he feared, yet the instincts of his","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"294",7477,"trade told him that it is not well when any noise whatever follows a","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"295",7477,"diamond by night, and this was one of the largest that had ever come to","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"296",7477,"him in the way of business. When he came to the narrow way that leads to","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"297",7477,"spider-forest, Dead Man's Diamond feeling cold and heavy, and the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"298",7477,"velvety footfall seeming fearfully close, the jeweller stopped and","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"299",7477,"almost hesitated. He looked behind him; there was nothing there. He","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"300",7477,"listened attentively; there was no sound now. Then he thought of the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"301",7477,"screams of the Merchant Prince's daughter, whose soul was the diamond's","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"302",7477,"price, and smiled and went stoutly on. There watched him, apathetically,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"303",7477,"over the narrow way, that grim and dubious woman whose house is the Night.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"304",7477,"Thangobrind, hearing no longer the sound of suspicious feet, felt easier","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"305",7477,"now. He was all but come to the end of the narrow way, when the woman","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"306",7477,"listlessly uttered that ominous cough.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"307",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"308",7477,"The cough was too full of meaning to be disregarded. Thangobrind turned","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"309",7477,"round and saw at once what he feared. The spider-idol had not stayed at","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"310",7477,"home. The jeweller put his diamond gently upon the ground and drew his","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"311",7477,"sword called Mouse. And then began that famous fight upon the narrow way","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"312",7477,"in which the grim old woman whose house was Night seemed to take so","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"313",7477,"little interest. To the spider-idol you saw at once it was all a","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"314",7477,"horrible joke. To the jeweller it was grim earnest. He fought and panted","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"315",7477,"and was pushed back slowly along the narrow way, but he wounded Hlo-hlo","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"316",7477,"all the while with terrible long gashes all over his deep, soft body","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"317",7477,"till Mouse was slimy with blood. But at last the persistent laughter of","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"318",7477,"Hlo-hlo was too much for the jeweller's nerves, and, once more wounding","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"319",7477,"his demoniac foe, he sank aghast and exhausted by the door of the house","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"320",7477,"called Night at the feet of the grim old woman, who having uttered once","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"321",7477,"that ominous cough interfered no further with the course of events. And","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"322",7477,"there carried Thangobrind the jeweller away those whose duty it was, to","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"323",7477,"the house where the two men hang, and taking down from his hook the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"324",7477,"left-hand one of the two, they put that venturous jeweller in his place;","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"325",7477,"so that there fell on him the doom that he feared, as all men know","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"326",7477,"though it is so long since, and there abated somewhat the ire of the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"341",7477,"me eagerly welcome. And I, in spite of the deed, was glad of any","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"342",7477,"shelter from that ominous wood. I saw at once that there had been a","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"343",7477,"deed, although a cloak did all that a cloak may do to conceal it. The","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"345",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"346",7477,"The Sphinx was moody and silent. I had not come to pry into the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"348",7477,"so had little to say and few questions to ask; but to whatever I did","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"349",7477,"say she remained morosely indifferent. It was clear that either she","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"350",7477,"suspected me of being in search of the secrets of one of her gods, or","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"351",7477,"of being boldly inquisitive about her traffic with Time, or else she","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"356",7477,"back to the door again. And it was clear that the welcome was to be a","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"357",7477,"bolted door. But such bolts, and such a door! Rust and decay and","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"358",7477,"fungus had been there far too long, and it was not a barrier any","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"359",7477,"longer that would keep out even a determined wolf. And it seemed to be","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"360",7477,"something worse than a wolf that they feared.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"361",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"363",7477,"and ghastly thing was looking for the Sphinx, and that something that","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"364",7477,"had happened had made its arrival certain. It appeared that they had","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"365",7477,"slapped the Sphinx to vex her out of her apathy in order that she","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"366",7477,"should pray to one of her gods, whom she had littered in the house of","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"367",7477,"Time; but her moody silence was invincible, and her apathy Oriental,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"368",7477,"ever since the deed had happened. And when they found that they could","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"370",7477,"useless attentions to the rusty lock of the door, and to look at the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"372",7477,"it might not bring that destined thing from the forest, which no one","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"373",7477,"named.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"374",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"375",7477,"It may be said I had chosen a gruesome house, but not if I had","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"376",7477,"described the forest from which I came, and I was in need of any spot","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"377",7477,"wherein I could rest my mind from the thought of it.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"378",7477,"","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"379",7477,"I wondered very much what thing would come from the forest on account","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"380",7477,"of the deed; and having seen that forest--as you, gentle reader, have","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"381",7477,"not--I had the advantage of knowing that anything might come. It was","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"382",7477,"useless to ask the Sphinx--she seldom reveals things, like her","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"383",7477,"paramour Time (the gods take after her), and while this mood was on","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"384",7477,"her, rebuff was certain. So I quietly began to oil the lock of the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"385",7477,"door. And as soon as they saw this simple act I won their confidence.","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"386",7477,"It was not that my work was of any use--it should have been done long","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"387",7477,"before; but they saw that my interest was given for the moment to the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"388",7477,"thing that they thought vital. They clustered round me then. They","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"389",7477,"asked me what I thought of the door, and whether I had seen better,","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"390",7477,"and whether I had seen worse; and I told them about all the doors I","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"391",7477,"knew, and said that the doors of the baptistry in Florence were better","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"392",7477,"doors, and the doors made by a certain firm of builders in London were","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"393",7477,"worse. And then I asked them what it was that was coming after the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"394",7477,"Sphinx because of the deed. And at first they would not say, and I","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"395",7477,"stopped oiling the door; and then they said that it was the","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"396",7477,"arch-inquisitor of the forest, who is investigator and avenger of all","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"397",7477,"silverstrian things; and from all that they said about him it seemed to me","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"398",7477,"that this person was quite white, and was a kind of madness that would","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"399",7477,"settle down quite blankly upon a place, a kind of mist in which reason","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"400",7477,"could not live; and it was the fear of this that made them fumble","The Book of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
