"5640",765,"","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5641",765,"Then, to my intense embarrassment, without warning, two of the","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5642",765,"black-haired girls entered, bearing robes of a peculiar dull-blue hue.","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5643",765,"At our manifest discomfort Rador's laughter roared out. He took the","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5644",765,"garments from the pair, motioned them to leave us, and, still","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5645",765,"laughing, threw one around me. Its texture was soft, but decidedly","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5646",765,"metallic--like some blue metal spun to the fineness of a spider's","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5647",765,"thread. The garment buckled tightly at the throat, was girdled at the","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5648",765,"waist, and, below this cincture, fell to the floor, its folds being","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5649",765,"held together by a half-dozen looped cords; from the shoulders a hood","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"

"5651",765,"","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5652",765,"Rador cast this over my head; it completely covered my face, but was","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5653",765,"of so transparent a texture that I could see, though somewhat mistily,","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5654",765,"through it. Finally he handed us both a pair of long gloves of the","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5655",765,"same material and high stockings, the feet of which were","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"

"5692",765,"a shaft not black as had been that abode of living darkness, but","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5693",765,"faintly luminescent. Rador leaned over the wall. The mechanism clicked","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5694",765,"and started; the door swung shut; the sides of the car slipped into","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"

"5702",765,"the dwarfish men, grey-headed, old, clad in flowing garments of white,","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"

"5713",765,"each side were high pedestals holding carved figures of the same","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"

"5728",765,"was a torrent of blue sea-water racing with prodigious speed between","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"

"5730",765,"sped by, and far to the right was a low arch through which it","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
"5731",765,"disappeared. It was so swift that its surface shone like polished blue","The Moon Pool","Merritt, Abraham","Science Fiction","en"
