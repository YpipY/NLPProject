"1041",8199,"At the end where we had met it the mysterious tunnel was considerably","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1044",8199,"see the outlines of two or three flat cars loaded with broken stone,","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1104",8199,"within three feet of the wall of rock behind which we crouched stood","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1105",8199,"Dr. Syx, his dark profile looking almost satanic in the sharp contrast","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1116",8199,"straight at the aperture. My heart was in my mouth, for at first I","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1117",8199,"believed from his expression that he had detected the gleam of my","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1119",8199,"rock, and paid no further attention. Then his lips moved, and I put my","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1195",8199,"thinking the matter over, he concluded that Syx was too powerful to be","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1196",8199,"attacked with success, especially when the only evidence against him","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1197",8199,"was that he had claimed to find artemisium in his mine at a time when,","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1198",8199,"as everybody knew, artemisium actually was found outside the","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1199",8199,"mine. There was no apparent motive for the deception, and no proof of","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1200",8199,"malicious intent. In short, Mr. Boon decided that the best thing for","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1201",8199,"him and his stockholders to do was to keep silent about their losses","The Moon Metal","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
