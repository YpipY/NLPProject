"149",8673,"sometimes partly opened up his mind, and we were charmed by his variety","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1265",8673,"that sometimes appears in the expanded pupils of a cat or a wild beast.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1266",8673,"The great hairy head was black, but the stocky body was as white as a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1267",8673,"polar bear. The arms were apelike and very long and muscular, and the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1268",8673,"entire aspect of the creature betokened immense strength and activity.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1270",8673,"Edmund was the first to recover from the stupor of surprise, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1271",8673,"instantly he did a thing so apparently absurd but so marvelous in its","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1272",8673,"calculated effect that no brain but his could have conceived it. It","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1273",8673,"shakes me at once with laughter and recollected terror when I recall it.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1274",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1275",8673,"""WELL, HELLO YOU!"" he called out in a voice of such stentorian power that","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1276",8673,"we jumped as at a thunderclap. The effect on the strange brute was","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1277",8673,"electric. A film shot across the big eyes, he leaped into the air,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1278",8673,"uttering a squeak that was ridiculous, coming from an animal of such size","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1279",8673,"and strength, and instantly disappeared, tumbling down the steps.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1280",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1281",8673,"But we were as much frightened as the ugly monster himself. We stared at","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1282",8673,"Edmund, speechless in our amazement. Never could I have believed it","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1283",8673,"possible for such a voice to issue from the human throat. It was not the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1284",8673,"voice of our friend, nor the voice of a man at all, but an indescribable","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1285",8673,"clangor; and the words I have quoted had been scarcely distinguishable,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1286",8673,"so shattered were they by the crash of sound that whirled them into our","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1287",8673,"astonished ears. Edmund, seeing us gaping in speechless wonder, laughed","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1288",8673,"with such an appearance of hearty enjoyment as I had never known him to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1289",8673,"exhibit--and his merriment produced another thunderous explosion that","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1290",8673,"shook the air.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1291",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1292",8673,"Then the truth burst upon me, and I exclaimed:","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1297",8673,"mouth, as if to testify to the correctness of my explanation.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1298",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1299",8673,"""Yes,"" said Edmund, taking pains to moderate his voice, ""you've hit it,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1300",8673,"it's the atmosphere. I had calculated on an effect of the kind, but the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1301",8673,"reality exceeds all that I had anticipated. Spectroscopic analysis as","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1302",8673,"well as telescopic appearances demonstrated long ago that the atmosphere","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1303",8673,"of Venus was extraordinarily extensive and dense, from which fact I","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1304",8673,"inferred that we should encounter some wonderful acoustic phenomena here,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1305",8673,"and this was in my mind when, on stepping out of the car, I addressed you","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1306",8673,"in a whisper. The reaction even of the whisper on my organs of speech","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1307",8673,"told me that I was right, and showed me what to expect if the full power","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1308",8673,"of the voice were used. When we caught sight of the creature at the top","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1309",8673,"of the pit I had no desire to shoot him, and I saw that he was too","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1310",8673,"powerful to be captured alive. In a second I had decided what to do. It","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1311",8673,"ran through my mind that, in a world where the density, and probably","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1312",8673,"something also in the peculiar constitution of the air, had the effect of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1313",8673,"vastly magnifying sound, the phonetic and acoustic organs of the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1314",8673,"inhabitants would be modified, and that the sounds uttered by them would","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1315",8673,"be much fainter than those that we are accustomed to hear from living","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1316",8673,"creatures on the earth. That being so, I argued that a very great and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1317",8673,"heavy sound coming from a strange animal would produce in the creature","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1318",8673,"before us a paralyzing terror. You have seen that it did so. I expect","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1319",8673,"that this will give us an immense advantage to begin with. We have","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1320",8673,"already inspired so great a fear that I believe that we can now safely","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1321",8673,"follow the creature into its habitation, and encounter without danger any","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1322",8673,"of its congeners that may be there. Nevertheless, I shall not ask you to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1343",8673,"sunlight in a haymow, was accompanied by a considerable degree of heat,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1344",8673,"which was very grateful to our lungs after the frigid plunge that we had","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1345",8673,"taken from the comfortable car. As we descended, the temperature","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1346",8673,"continually rose until we were glad to throw off our Arctic togs, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1347",8673,"leave them on a shelf of rock to await our return. But, fortunately, we","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1348",8673,"did not forget to take the pistols from the pockets before leaving the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"1351",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1352",8673,"It was an awful hole for depth. The steps, rudely cut, wound round and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1353",8673,"round the sides like those in a cathedral tower, but the pit was not","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"1354",8673,"perfectly circular. It looked like a natural formation, such as the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2541",8673,"tossed and whirled onward the water rose yet higher, and blocks of ice","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2542",8673,"assailed us on all sides. First the sled on the left was torn loose; then","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2543",8673,"the other followed it, leaving the car to fight its battle alone. But the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2544",8673,"loss of the sleds was a good thing now that their occupants were gone,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2545",8673,"for it eased off the weight and the car rose much higher in the water.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2546",8673,"Moreover, it gave way more readily when pressed by the ice. To be sure,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2547",8673,"it rolled more than before, but still, being well ballasted, it did not","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2548",8673,"turn turtle, and most of the time we were able to keep on our feet by","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2551",8673,"Once we took a terrible plunge, over a vertical fall of not less than","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2552",8673,"twenty or thirty feet. But the water below the fall was very deep, a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2555",8673,"bobbing to the top again like a cork. Below this fall there was a very","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2556",8673,"long series of rapids, extending, it seemed, for miles upon miles, and we","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2557",8673,"shot down them with the speed of an express train, lurching from side to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2558",8673,"side, and colliding with hundreds of ice floes. It must not be supposed","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2559",8673,"that we went through this experience without suffering any injuries. On","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2561",8673,"eye closed by a blow, and our clothing, for we were not wearing our","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2563",8673,"serious, although we looked as if we had just come out of the toughest","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2564",8673,"kind of a street brawl.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2565",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2566",8673,"But there is no use in prolonging the story of this awful ride. It seemed","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2567",8673,"to us to last for days upon days, though, in fact, the worst of it was","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2568",8673,"over within twelve hours after we were lifted from our moorings in the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2569",8673,"valley. The tumbling stream gradually broadened out as it left the region","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2570",8673,"of the high mountains, and then we found ourselves in a district covered","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2571",8673,"with icy hills of no great elevation. But we could still see, by glances,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2572",8673,"as the stream curved this way and that, the glittering peaks behind. It","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2573",8673,"was an appalling thing to watch many of the nearer hills as they suddenly","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2574",8673,"sank, collapsed, and disappeared, like pinnacles of loaf sugar melting","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2577",8673,"Edmund said that all of the ice-hills and mounds through which we were","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2578",8673,"passing no doubt owed their existence to pressure from behind, in the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2579",8673,"belt where the sun never rose, and where the ice was piled up in actual","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2583",8673,"After a long time the now broad river widened yet more until it became a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2584",8673,"great lake, or bay. The surface of the planet around appeared nearly","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2585",8673,"level, and, as far as we could see, was mostly covered by the water. Here","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2586",8673,"vast fields of ice floated, and the water was not muddy, as it would have","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2589",8673,"now the sun was high above the horizon ahead, and shining in an almost","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2590",8673,"clear sky. Presently we began to notice the wind again. It came fitfully,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2591",8673,"first from one quarter and then another, rapidly increasing until, at","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2592",8673,"times, it rose into a tempest. It lifted the water in huge combing waves,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2632",8673,"tempestuous wind. Its force increased hour by hour, and at last the sky,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2659",8673,"curtains, tinted like sheets of mother-of-pearl. The sun was no longer","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2669",8673,"of the car had now nearly ceased, and we had no difficulty in maintaining","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2787",8673,"surmounted with deck houses, and along the railings inclosing the decks","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2788",8673,"were gathered the crews, among whom we believed that we could recognize","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2789",8673,"their officers. The two vessels had approached within a hundred yards","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2790",8673,"before being suddenly arrested. Then they settled gracefully down upon","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2793",8673,"At first, as I have said, the resemblance of their crews to inhabitants","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2815",8673,"inhabitants of the dark hemisphere, they were, evidently, unaccustomed","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2818",8673,"not, as we half expected it would, take flight. The momentary commotion","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2819",8673,"was quickly quieted, and our visitors continued their inspection. All of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2820",8673,"us immediately recognized the personage whom Jack had singled out as the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2821",8673,"subject of his startling exclamation. It was clear that he had rightly","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2822",8673,"guessed her sex, and she appeared worthy of his admiring designation.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2823",8673,"Even at the distance of a hundred feet we could see that she was very","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2824",8673,"beautiful. Her complexion was light, with a flame upon the cheeks; her","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2825",8673,"hair a chestnut blond; and her large, round eyes were sapphire blue, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2826",8673,"seemed to radiate a light of their own. This last statement (about the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2827",8673,"eyes) must not be taken for a conventional exaggeration, such as writers","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"2829",8673,"contrary, it expresses a literal fact; and moreover, as the reader will","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"2830",8673,"see further on, this peculiarity of the eyes was shared, in varying","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"3653",8673,"which meant, at the same time, an inquiry as to the nature of the wound","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"3654",8673,"and an expression of the wish to do something to repair the injury. She","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4241",8673,"of the fundamental difficulty of the idea that he was trying to convey,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4242",8673,"but yet the meaning did not escape, and as he continued his strange","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4243",8673,"communication, the wonder spread from face to face, for it was not only","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4252",8673,"read their thoughts. In her face, I believed that I could detect every","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4254",8673,"the old judge was more implacable, or more incredulous. There was no","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4270",8673,"movements. Now he appeared at the left of the throne, leading a file of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4272",8673,"deposited their burden within a yard of the place where Edmund was","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4277",8673,"to show the manner in which death had been inflicted. It had been crushed","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4278",8673,"in a way which could probably mean nothing else than a fearful fall. The","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4295",8673,"This time, since his meaning involved no conception lying utterly beyond","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4300",8673,"understood it perfectly, and he rejected it on the instant. My reason","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4301",8673,"told me that nothing else could have been expected of him, for, truly,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4302",8673,"this was drawing it rather strong--to claim twice in succession immunity","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4306",8673,"opposition between our two judges had broken out again, and was now more","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4307",8673,"decided than before. The features of the old man grew fearfully stern,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4308",8673,"and he rejected all the apparent overtures of Ala. He had been willing to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4309",8673,"pardon the injury and insult to her person, since she herself insisted","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4310",8673,"upon pardon, but now the affair was entirely different. Whether purposely","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4311",8673,"or not, we had caused the death of a subject of the realm, and he was not","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4312",8673,"to be swerved aside from what he regarded as his duty. My nerves shook at","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4319",8673,"glitter with strange light. One could see the resistance in them rising","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4320",8673,"to passion, and, at last, as the aged judge again shook his head, with","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"4341",8673,"the unwritten law of this realm of Venus, she, as queen, had the right to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4342",8673,"interpose between justice and its victim, and such interposition was","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4343",8673,"always expressed in the way which we had witnessed. It was a right rarely","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4344",8673,"exercised, and probably few then present had ever before seen it put into","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4345",8673,"action. The sensation which it caused was, in consequence, exceedingly","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4346",8673,"great, and a murmur of astonishment arose from the throng in the great","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4347",8673,"apartment, and hundreds pressed around the throne, staring at us and at","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4348",8673,"the queen. The majestic look which had accompanied her act gradually","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4349",8673,"faded, and her features resumed their customary expression of kindness.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4350",8673,"The old judge had risen as she stepped from her place beside him, and he","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4351",8673,"seemed as much astonished as any onlooker. His hands trembled, he shook","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4352",8673,"his head, and a single word came from his mouth, pronounced with a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"4353",8673,"curious emphasis. Ala turned to him, with a new defiance in her eyes,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5358",8673,"on the spreading roots of a giant tree, and sleeping the sleep of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5359",8673,"sensuous languor.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5360",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5361",8673,"Our waking was as terrible as it was sudden. I heard a cry, and at the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5362",8673,"same instant felt an irresistible hand grasping me by the throat. As I","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5363",8673,"opened my eyes I saw that the whole party were prisoners. Nearby an air","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5364",8673,"ship was quivering, as, held in leash, it lightly touched the ground; and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5365",8673,"a dozen gigantic fellows, whipping our hands behind our backs, hurried us","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5366",8673,"aboard, the great mechanical bird, which instantly rose, describing a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5367",8673,"circle that carried us above the treetops. I did not try to struggle, for","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5368",8673,"I felt how vain would be any effort that I could make.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5369",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5370",8673,"Glancing about me, the very first features I recognized were those of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5371",8673,"Ingra. At last he had us in his power!","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5372",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5373",8673,"I looked at Edmund, but his face was set in thought, and he did not","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5374",8673,"return my glance. Henry, as usual, had plunged into silent hopelessness,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5375",8673,"and Jack was a picture of mingled rage and despair. Although we were","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5376",8673,"loosely fastened side by side to a rail on the deck, neither of us spoke","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5377",8673,"for perhaps half an hour. In the meantime the air ship rose to a height","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5378",8673,"greater than that of the nearby mountains, and then more slowly","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5379",8673,"approached them. At last it began to circle, as if an uncertainty","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5380",8673,"concerning the route to be chosen had arisen, and I observed, for we","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5381",8673,"could look all about in spite of our bonds, that Ingra and one who","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5382",8673,"appeared to be his lieutenant were engaged in an animated discussion.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5383",8673,"They pointed this way and that, and the debate grew every moment more","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5384",8673,"earnest. This continued for a long time, while the ship hovered, running","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5385",8673,"slowly in the wide circles. We could not then know how much this","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5386",8673,"hesitation meant for us. If Ingra had been as rapid in his decision now","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5387",8673,"as he was in the act of taking us prisoners, this history would never","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5388",8673,"have been written. I watched Edmund, and saw that his attention was","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5389",8673,"absorbed by what our captors were about, and even in that emergency I","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5390",8673,"felt a touch of comfort through my unfailing confidence in our leader.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5391",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5392",8673,"Finally a decision seemed to have been reached, and we set off over the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5393",8673,"crest of the range. As its huge peaks towered behind us and we descended","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5394",8673,"nearer the ground, my heart sank again, for now we were cut off from the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5395",8673,"world beyond, and in the improbable event of any pursuit, how could the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5396",8673,"pursuers know what course we had taken, or where to look for us? And,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5397",8673,"then, who would pursue? Juba could do nothing, Ala was far away at the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5398",8673,"capital, even supposing that she should be disposed to set out in search","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5399",8673,"of us, and hours, perhaps days, must elapse before she could be informed","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5400",8673,"of what had happened. Not even when Jack and I were in the dungeon had","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5401",8673,"our case seemed so desperate.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5406",8673,"Good fortune had willed that we should be so placed upon the deck that we","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5407",8673,"faced most easily sternward. Suddenly, as I gazed despondently at the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5408",8673,"serrated horizon receding in the distance, a thrill ran through my nerves","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5409",8673,"at the sight of a dark speck in the sky, which seemed to float over one","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5410",8673,"of the highest peaks. A second look assured me that it was moving; a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5411",8673,"third gave birth to the wild thought that it was in chase. Then I turned","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5412",8673,"to Edmund and whispered:","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5420",8673,"object; but I could not withdraw my eyes from it. Sometimes I persuaded","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5421",8673,"myself that it was growing larger, and then, with the intensity of my","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5422",8673,"gaze, it blurred and seemed to fade. At last Jack spied it, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5423",8673,"instantly, in his impetuous way, he exclaimed:","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5428",8673,"direction of our glances, and himself saw the growing speck. He turned","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5429",8673,"with flushed face to his lieutenant and in a trice the vessel began","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5434",8673,"are pursued by somebody whom he does not wish to meet. Most likely it is","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5435",8673,"the queen, although it seems impossible that she could so quickly have","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5436",8673,"learned of our mishap. Peter and I have been watching that object, which","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5443",8673,"given it, so painful was the impression that it made upon Jack's","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5444",8673,"generous heart. His countenance was convulsed, and a tear rolled down his","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5445",8673,"cheek--all the more pitiful to see because his arms were pinioned, and he","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5462",8673,"trees that we were passing over, for now we had entered a wide region of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5466",8673,"the greatest speed that could be coaxed out of the motors. Suddenly a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5467",8673,"shocking thought crossed my mind. I tried to banish it, fearing that","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5468",8673,"Ingra might read it in my eyes, and act upon it. Suppose that he should","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5469",8673,"hurl us overboard! It was in his power to do so, and it seemed a quick","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5470",8673,"and final solution. But he showed no intention to do anything of the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5471",8673,"kind. He may have had good reasons for refraining, but, at the time I","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5472",8673,"could only ascribe his failure to take a summary way out of his","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5473",8673,"difficulty to a protecting hand which guarded us even in this extremity.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5475",8673,"On we rushed through the humming air, and still the pursuing speck chased","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5498",8673,"could see that ahead of us the general inclination of the ground was","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5499",8673,"downward. I eagerly glanced back to see if the pursuers were yet in","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5500",8673,"sight. Yes! There was the speck, grown so large now that there could be","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5504",8673,"could plainly perceive the chasers; but could they see us? I tried to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5505",8673,"hope that they could, but reason was against it. Still they were","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5510",8673,"to the pursuers. But not content with one change, he doubled like a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5511",8673,"hunted fox. We watched for the effect of these maneuvers upon those","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5512",8673,"behind us, and to our intense disappointment, though not to our surprise,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5513",8673,"we saw that they were continuing straight ahead. They surely could not","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5515",8673,"baffle it, and find our track again? At last the spreading darkness","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5516",8673,"swallowed up the arc of illuminated sky behind, and then we were alone in","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5521",8673,"accustomed to it, we could begin to discern something of the character of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5522",8673,"our surroundings. We flew within a hundred yards of the ground, which","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5531",8673,"nostrils, or to starve amidst the fens! But his real intention, as you","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5532",8673,"will perceive in a little while, was yet more diabolical.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5612",8673,"by the pressure, and with inarticulate cries most of those on board","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5615",8673,"crashed through the branches, clinging to an upright on the sloping deck,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5619",8673,"Almost at the same moment I caught sight of the head of the monstrous","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5620",8673,"animal which had caused the disaster. It was as massive as that of an","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5621",8673,"elephant or mammoth; and the awful arm resembled a trunk, but was of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5622",8673,"incredible size. Moreover, it was covered with sucking mouths or disks.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5623",8673,"The creature apparently had four eyes ranged round the conical front of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5624",8673,"the head where it tapered into the trunk, and two of these were visible,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5625",8673,"huge, green, and deadly bright in the gleam of the lantern.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5626",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5627",8673,"For a moment we all stood as if petrified; then the great arm was thrown","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5628",8673,"with a movement quick as lightning round both Ala and Juba as they clung","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5629",8673,"to the upright! My heart shot into my mouth, but before the animal could","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5630",8673,"haul in its prey, a series of terrific reports rattled like the discharge","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5631",8673,"of a machine gun at my ear. The monstrous arm released the victims, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5632",8673,"waved in agony, breaking the thick, clammy branches of the vegetation,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5633",8673,"and the vast head disappeared. Edmund had fired all the ten shots in his","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5634",8673,"automatic pistol with a single pressure of the double trigger and an","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5635",8673,"unvarying aim, directed, no doubt, at one of the creature's eyes.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5637",8673,"""Quick!"" he shouted, as the air ship, relieved from the stress, righted","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5641",8673,"that we had no great difficulty in obeying his commands. He was the last","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5642",8673,"aboard, and instantly he grasped the controlling apparatus, and we rose","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5643",8673,"out of the tangle. We could hear the wounded monster thrashing in the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5644",8673,"swamp, but saw only the reflection of its movements in the commotion of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5649",8673,"he brought the air ship to a hover, circling slowly above the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5652",8673,"""We cannot leave the poor fellows who have fallen overboard,"" he said, as","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5656",8673,"Soon their cries came to our ears, and turning down the light of the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5657",8673,"lantern we saw five of them collected together on the solid ground, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5658",8673,"gesticulating to us in an agony of terror. Edmund swept the ship around","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5659",8673,"until we were directly over the poor fellows, and then allowed it to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5660",8673,"settle until it rested on the ground beside them. I trembled with","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5661",8673,"apprehension at this bold maneuver, but Edmund was as steady as a rock.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5662",8673,"Ala instantly comprehended his intention, and encouraged her followers,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5663",8673,"who were all but paralyzed with fright, to clamber aboard. A momentary","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5664",8673,"communication of the eyes took place between Edmund and Ala, and I","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5665",8673,"understood that he was demanding if all had been found.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5666",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5667",8673,"There was another--and not a trace of him could be seen.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5674",8673,"""But I do,"" he said firmly, and before I could put my hand on his arm he","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5675",8673,"had dropped from the deck. The gigantic creature that he had wounded was","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5676",8673,"still thrashing about a little distance off, occasionally making horrible","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5677",8673,"sounds, but Edmund seemed to have no fear. We saw him, with amazement,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5678",8673,"walk collectedly round the ground encircled by the swamp, peering into","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5679",8673,"the tangle, and frequently uttering a call. But his search was vain, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5680",8673,"after five minutes of the most intense nervous strain that I ever","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5681",8673,"endured, I thanked Heaven for seeing him return in safety, and come","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5682",8673,"slowly aboard. There was another consultation with Ala, which evidently","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5683",8673,"related to the ability of the engineer of the ship to resume his","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5684",8673,"functions. This had a satisfactory result, for the fellow took his place,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"5686",8673,"rose only to a moderate height, and then began again to circle about. He","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5687",8673,"would not yet give up the search.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5688",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5689",8673,"We flew in widening circles, Edmund keeping his lantern directed toward","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5690",8673,"the ground, and the full horror of these interminable morasses now became","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5691",8673,"plain. I was in a continual shudder at the evidence of Ingra's pitiless","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5692",8673,"scheme for our destruction. He had meant that we should be the prey of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5693",8673,"the unspeakable inhabitants of the fens, and had believed that there was","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5694",8673,"no possibility of escape from them. We became aware that there was a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5695",8673,"great variety of them in the swamps and thickets beneath through the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5696",8673,"noises that they made--heart-quaking cries, squealing sounds, gruntings,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5697",8673,"and, most trying of all, a loud, piercing whistle whose sibilant","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"5698",8673,"pulsations penetrated the ear like thrusts of a needle. I pictured to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"6009",8673,"thought of such a thing as an attempt to escape on our part, they trusted","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"6029",8673,"Another equally favorable circumstance--and perhaps it was even more","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"6366",8673,"So it was settled without an appeal to chance, and I went with Edmund and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6367",8673,"Juba. As usual Edmund immediately put his project into execution. It","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6368",8673,"showed an astonishing confidence in us that Ala should consent to make","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6369",8673,"such a trip, and that her people, and especially Ingra, should assent to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6370",8673,"it, and I could not sufficiently wonder at the fact. But we were now at","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6371",8673,"the summit of favor and influence, and it is impossible to guess what","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6372",8673,"thoughts may have been in their minds. At any rate, it showed how","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6373",8673,"completely Edmund had established himself in Ala's esteem, and I suspect","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6374",8673,"that her woman's curiosity had played a large part in the decision. There","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6375",8673,"was another thing which astonished me yet more, and, in fact, awakened a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6376",8673,"good deal of apprehension in my mind. I could not but wonder that Edmund,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6377",8673,"after all the precautions that he had previously taken, should now think","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6378",8673,"of admitting these people into the car, where they could witness his","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6379",8673,"manipulations of the mechanism. I spoke to him about it. ""Rest your mind","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6380",8673,"easy about that,"" he said. ""Now that everything goes like a charm, they","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6381",8673,"will suspect nothing. It will be all a complete mystery to them. Even the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6382",8673,"gods used natural agencies when they visited the earth without shaking","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"6386",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6387",8673,"I said no more, but I was not convinced, and the sequel proved that, for","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6388",8673,"once, Edmund had made a serious mistake, the more amazing because he had","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6389",8673,"been the first to detect the exceptional intelligence and shrewdness of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6390",8673,"Ingra. But, no doubt, in the exultation of his recent triumph, he counted","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6391",8673,"upon the strength of the superstitious regard in which we were held.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6392",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6393",8673,"Our departure from the tower was the signal for the assembling of great","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6394",8673,"crowds of spectators again, and we sailed away with the utmost _eclat_.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6395",8673,"Ala at once showed all the eager excitement of a child over so novel and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6396",8673,"enjoyable an experience. The motion of the car was entirely unlike that","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6397",8673,"of the air ships. Perfectly steady, it skimmed along at a speed which","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6398",8673,"filled her with amazement and delight. The city, with its towers, seemed","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6399",8673,"to fly away from us by magic, and the trees and fields beneath ran into","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6400",8673,"streaming lines. The windows were thrown wide open, and all stood by","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6401",8673,"them, watching the scene. Finally Ala wished to go out on the window","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6402",8673,"ledges, where one was perfectly secure if he kept a firm hold on the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6403",8673,"supports. Edmund was most of the time with us outside, only stepping","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6404",8673,"within when he wished to change the course. I thought that he showed a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6405",8673,"disposition to conceal his manipulations as much as possible, as if what","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6406",8673,"I had said had made an impression. But all were so much occupied with","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6407",8673,"their novel sensations that, for the time at least, there was no danger","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6408",8673,"of their taking note of anything else.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6409",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6410",8673,"I believe that it must have been some intimation from Ala which finally","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6411",8673,"led Edmund to hold his course toward the mountains, but in a direction","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6412",8673,"different from that which led to the mines. When he had once chosen this","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6413",8673,"direction he worked up the speed to fully a hundred miles an hour, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6414",8673,"all were compelled to go inside on account of the wind created by our","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6415",8673,"rush through the air. We held on thus for five hours. During this time","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6416",8673,"Edmund spread a repast made up of dishes chosen from the supplies in the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6417",8673,"car, and, of course, utterly strange to our guests. They found them to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6418",8673,"their taste, however, and were delighted with Edmund's entertainment. We","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6419",8673,"spent a long time at our little table, and I was surprised at the variety","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6420",8673,"of delicious things which Edmund managed to extract from his stores.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6421",8673,"There was even some champagne, and I noticed that Edmund urged it upon","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6422",8673,"Ingra, who, nothing loth, drank enough to make him decidedly tipsy, a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6423",8673,"fact which was not surprising since we had found that the wines of Venus","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6424",8673,"were very light, and but slightly alcoholized.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6425",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6426",8673,"At length we began to approach what proved to be the goal of our journey.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6427",8673,"Before us spread a vast extent of forest composed of trees of the most","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6428",8673,"beautiful forms and foliage. Some towered up to a great height, spreading","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6429",8673,"their pendulous branches over the less aspiring forms, like New England","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6430",8673,"elms; others were low and bushy, and afire with scarlet blossoms, whose","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6431",8673,"perfume filled the air; a few resembled gigantic grasses or great timothy","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6432",8673,"stems, surmounted with nodding plumes of golden leaves, streaming out","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6433",8673,"like gilt gonfalons in the breeze; but there was one species, as tall and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6434",8673,"massive as oaks, and scattered everywhere through the forest, that I","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6435",8673,"could liken to nothing but enormous rose bushes in the full bloom of","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6436",8673,"June. When we began to pass above this strange woodland, Ala made some","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6437",8673,"communication to Edmund which caused him to slow down the movement of the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6438",8673,"car. By almost imperceptible touches he controlled the motive power, and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6439",8673,"presently we came to rest above a delightful glade, where a small stream","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6440",8673,"ran at the foot of a gravelly slope, crowned with grass and overhung by","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6441",8673,"trees.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6442",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6443",8673,"Here the car was allowed to settle gently upon the ground, and all","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6444",8673,"alighted. Ingra, over whom the influence of the champagne had been","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6445",8673,"growing, tottered on his legs in a way that would have filled Jack with","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6446",8673,"uncontrollable delight, but Edmund gravely helped him out of the car and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6447",8673,"steadied him to a seat on the soft turf under the tree. I saw Ala","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6448",8673,"regarding Ingra with a puzzled look, and no wonder, for Edmund had been","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6449",8673,"careful that no one else should take enough of the wine to produce more","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6450",8673,"than the slightest exhilaration of spirits. It is possible that Edmund","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6451",8673,"had plied Ingra with the idea of rendering him less observant, and it","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6452",8673,"probably had that effect; but it resulted, as you will see presently, in","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6453",8673,"a revelation which finally put Edmund on guard against the very danger to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6454",8673,"which he had seemed so insensible when I mentioned it to him before our","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6455",8673,"start.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6456",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6457",8673,"The place where we now were was, beyond comparison, the most charming","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6458",8673,"that we had yet seen. A very Eden it seemed, wild, splendid, and remote","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6459",8673,"from all cultivation. The air was loaded with indescribable fragrance","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6460",8673,"shed from the thousands of strange blossoms that depended from trees and","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6461",8673,"shrubs, and starred the rich grass. I learned afterwards from Edmund, who","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6462",8673,"had it from Ala, that the spot was famous for its beauty and other","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6463",8673,"attractions, and was sometimes visited in air ships from the capital. But","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6464",8673,"for them, what took us but a few hours was a trip extending over several","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6465",8673,"days of time. One would have said that the forest was imbedded in a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6466",8673,"garden of the most extraordinary orchids. The shapes of some of the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6467",8673,"flowers were so fantastic that it seemed impossible that Nature could","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6468",8673,"have produced them. And their colors were no less unparalleled,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6469",8673,"inimitable, and incredible.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6470",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6471",8673,"The flowery bank on which we had chosen our resting place was removed a","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6472",8673,"few yards from the spot where the car rested, and the latter was hidden","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6473",8673,"from view by intervening branches and huge racemes of gorgeous flowers,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6474",8673,"hanging like embroidered curtains about us. A peculiarity of the place","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6475",8673,"was that little zephyr-like breezes seemed to haunt it, coming one could","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6476",8673,"not tell whence, and they stirred the hanging blossoms, keeping them in","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6477",8673,"almost continual rhythmic motion. The effect was wonderfully charming,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6478",8673,"but I observed that Ala was especially influenced by it. She sat with her","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6479",8673,"maid beside her, and fixed her eyes, with an expression of ecstasy, upon","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6480",8673,"the swinging flowers. I whispered to Edmund to regard her singular","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6481",8673,"absorption. But he had already noticed it, and seemed to be puzzling his","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6482",8673,"brain with thoughts that it suggested to him.","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6483",8673,"","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6484",8673,"Thus as we sat, the leaves of a tree over our heads were lightly stirred,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6485",8673,"and a bird, adorned with long plumes more beautiful than those of a bird","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6486",8673,"of paradise, alighted on a branch, and began to ruffle its iridescent","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6487",8673,"feathers in a peculiar way. With every movement waves of color seemed to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6488",8673,"flow over it, merging and dissolving in the most marvelous manner. As","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6489",8673,"soon as this bird appeared, Ala gave it all her attention, and the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6490",8673,"pleasure which she experienced in watching it was reflected upon her","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"6491",8673,"countenance. She seemed positively enraptured. After a few moments the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"6789",8673,"intensity of my surprise and consternation. There, at the farther end,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"6792",8673,"also on his knees, and busy with tools, apparently trying to detach the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7316",8673,"never observed, during our former visit, that either Juba or any of his","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7317",8673,"people was followed by these creatures; in fact, they had always fled at","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7324",8673,"hardly less moved by it than I. When Edmund and Jack came back, having","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7336",8673,"and Jack, having nothing else, threw a silver dollar on top of it. The","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7337",8673,"natives probably regarded these things as talismans, or religious","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7338",8673,"symbols, for they treated them with the greatest deference, and no doubt","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7341",8673,"even after the passage of ages. It was a singular fact, noted by Edmund,","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7342",8673,"that the natives exhibited not the slightest curiosity concerning their","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7346",8673,"When we had paid the last honors to Juba, we began to think of our final","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7347",8673,"departure. This place had become disagreeable to us. After the brilliant","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7351",8673,"Edmund still wished to make some investigations, and we were compelled to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7370",8673,"would try to make it memorable--which presented a still stronger reason","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7371",8673,"why we should not delay. But, with one thing and another, we were held","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7376",8673,"wait until the multitude had all assembled. They came trooping up into","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7377",8673,"the starlight, and I am sure that they had no idea of what we intended to","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7379",8673,"occasion, but they showed no sign of either regret or anxiety on that","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"

"7383",8673,"out on a window ledge in order to get a better view of the scene. Edmund","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7384",8673,"started the car, and we rose straight toward the earth which glowed in","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7385",8673,"the zenith. Our movement was unexpected, and we at once arrested the","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
"7386",8673,"attention even of the priests. The beginning of the ceremony was stopped","A Columbus of Space","Serviss, Garrett Putman","Science Fiction","en"
