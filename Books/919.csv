"21",919,"So, also, a thought is limited by another thought, but a body is","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"215",919,"is but one such substance.  I think that this may profitably be","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"216",919,"done at once; and, in order to proceed regularly with the","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"217",919,"demonstration, we must premise:--","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"218",919,"","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"219",919,"+++++1.  The true definition of a thing neither involves nor","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"220",919,"expresses anything beyond the nature of the thing defined.  From","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"221",919,"this it follows that--","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"222",919,"","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"223",919,"+++++2.  No definition implies or expresses a certain number of","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"224",919,"individuals, inasmuch as it expresses nothing beyond the nature","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"225",919,"of the thing defined.  For instance, the definition of a triangle","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"226",919,"expresses nothing beyond the actual nature of a triangle:  it","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"227",919,"does not imply any fixed number of triangles.","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"228",919,"","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"229",919,"+++++3.  There is necessarily for each individual existent thing","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"230",919,"a cause why it should  exist.","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"231",919,"","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"232",919,"+++++4.  This cause of existence must either be contained in the","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"233",919,"nature and definition of the thing defined, or must be postulated","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"234",919,"apart from such definition.","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"235",919,"","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"236",919,"It therefore follows that, if a given number of individual things","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"237",919,"exist in nature, there must be some cause for the existence of","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"238",919,"exactly that number, neither more nor less.  For example, if","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"239",919,"twenty men exist in the universe (for simplicity's sake, I will","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"240",919,"suppose them existing simultaneously, and to have had no","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"241",919,"predecessors), and we want to account for the existence of these","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"242",919,"twenty men, it will not be enough to show the cause of human","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"243",919,"existence in general; we must also show why there are exactly","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"244",919,"twenty men, neither more nor less:  for a cause must be assigned","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"245",919,"for the existence of each individual.  Now this cause cannot be","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"246",919,"contained in the actual nature of man, for the true definition of","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"247",919,"man does not involve any consideration of the number twenty.","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"248",919,"Consequently, the cause for the existence of these twenty men,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"249",919,"and, consequently, of each of them, must necessarily be sought","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"250",919,"externally to each individual. Hence we may lay down the absolute","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"251",919,"rule, that everything which may consist of several individuals","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"252",919,"must have an external cause.  And, as it has been shown already","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"253",919,"that existence appertains to the nature of substance, existence","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"254",919,"must necessarily be included in its definition; and from its","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"255",919,"definition alone existence must be deducible.  But from its","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"256",919,"definition (as we have shown, Notes ii., iii.), we cannot infer","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"496",919,"infinite, or consequently, that it can appertain to God.  This","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"497",919,"they illustrate with many examples, of which I will take one or","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"539",919,"an infinite quantity is measurable, and composed of finite parts:","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"540",919,"therefore, the only fair conclusion to be drawn is that infinite","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"541",919,"quantity is not measurable, and cannot be composed of finite","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"694",919,"infinite number of ways, or always flow from the same necessity;","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"700",919,"question attributes to God an omnipotence, in my opinion, far","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"701",919,"more perfect.  For, otherwise, we are compelled to confess that","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"702",919,"God understands an infinite number of creatable things, which he","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"703",919,"will never be able to create, for, if he created all that he","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"708",919,"everything over which his power extends; this seems to be a","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"713",919,"the eternal essence of God, we must take these words in some","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"720",919,"constellation, and a dog, an animal that barks.  This I will","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"721",919,"prove as follows.  If intellect belongs to the divine nature, it","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"722",919,"cannot be in nature, as ours is generally thought to be,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"723",919,"posterior to, or simultaneous with the things understood,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"725",919,"(Prop. xvi., Cor. i.).  On the  contrary, the truth and formal","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1208",919,"also admit that God's intellect, and God's will, and God's","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1229",919,"about that what is now  perfection should be extreme","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1230",919,"imperfection, and vice versa.  What is such an assertion, but","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1231",919,"an open declaration that God, who necessarily understands that","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1232",919,"which he wishes, might  bring it about by his will, that he","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1233",919,"should understand things differently from the way in  which he","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1234",919,"does understand them?  This (as we have just shown) is the height","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1235",919,"of absurdity.  Wherefore, I may turn the argument against its","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1236",919,"employers, as follows:--All things depend  on the power of God.","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1237",919,"In order that things should be different from what they are,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1238",919,"God's  will would necessarily have to be different.  But God's","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1239",919,"will cannot be different (as we have  just most clearly","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1282",919,"properties of God.  I have shown that he  necessarily exists,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1283",919,"that he is one:  that he is, and acts solely by the necessity of","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1284",919,"his own  nature; that he is the free cause of all things, and how","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1285",919,"he is so; that all things are in God,  and so depend on him, that","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1286",919,"without him they could neither exist nor be conceived; lastly,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1287",919,"that all things are predetermined by God, not through his free","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1288",919,"will or absolute fiat, but from  the very nature of God or","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1289",919,"infinite power.  I have further, where occasion afforded, taken","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1290",919,"care to remove the prejudices, which might impede the","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1291",919,"comprehension of my  demonstrations.  Yet there still remain","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1292",919,"misconceptions not a few, which might and may  prove very grave","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1293",919,"hindrances to the understanding of the concatenation of things,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1294",919,"as I have  explained it above.  I have therefore thought it worth","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1295",919,"while to bring these misconceptions  before the bar of reason.","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1296",919,"","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1297",919,"All such opinions spring from the notion commonly entertained,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1298",919,"that all things in nature act  as men themselves act, namely,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1299",919,"with an end in view.  It is accepted as certain, that God","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1300",919,"himself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1301",919,"that God made all things for man,  and man that he might worship","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1302",919,"him).  I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1303",919,"why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1304",919,"prone to adopt it?;   secondly, I will point out its falsity;","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1305",919,"and, lastly, I will show how it has given rise to  prejudices","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1306",919,"about good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1307",919,"confusion,  beauty and ugliness, and the like.  However, this is","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1308",919,"not the place to deduce these  misconceptions from the nature of","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1309",919,"the human mind:  it will be sufficient here, if I assume  as a","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1310",919,"starting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1311",919,"that all men are born  ignorant of the causes of things, that all","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1312",919,"have the desire to seek for what is useful to them,  and that","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1313",919,"they are conscious of such desire.  Herefrom it follows, first,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1314",919,"that men think  themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1315",919,"their volitions and desires, and never  even dream, in their","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1316",919,"ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1317",919,"desire.  Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1318",919,"that which is useful to  them, and which they seek.  Thus it","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1319",919,"comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of  the final","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1320",919,"causes of events, and when these are learned, they are content,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1321",919,"as having no cause  for further doubt.  If they cannot learn such","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1322",919,"causes from external sources, they are  compelled to turn to","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1323",919,"considering themselves, and reflecting what end would have","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1324",919,"induced  them personally to bring about the given event, and thus","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1325",919,"they necessarily judge other  natures by their own.  Further, as","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1326",919,"they find in themselves and outside themselves many  means which","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1327",919,"assist them not a little in the search for what is useful, for","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1328",919,"instance, eyes for  seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1329",919,"for yielding food, the sun for giving light, the  sea for","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1330",919,"breeding fish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1331",919,"means for  obtaining such conveniences.  Now as they are aware,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1332",919,"that they found these conveniences  and did not make them, they","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1333",919,"think they have cause for believing, that some other being has","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1334",919,"made them for their use.  As they look upon things as means, they","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1335",919,"cannot believe them to  be self-created; but, judging from the","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1336",919,"means which they are accustomed to prepare for  themselves, they","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1337",919,"are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1338",919,"endowed with  human freedom, who have arranged and adapted","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1339",919,"everything for human use.  They are  bound to estimate the nature","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1340",919,"of such rulers (having no information on the subject) in","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1341",919,"accordance with their own nature, and therefore they assert that","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1342",919,"the gods ordained  everything for the use of man, in order to","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1343",919,"bind man to themselves and obtain from him the  highest honor.","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1344",919,"Hence also it follows, that everyone thought out for himself,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1345",919,"according to  his abilities, a different way of worshipping God,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1346",919,"so that God might love him more than his  fellows, and direct the","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1347",919,"whole course of nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1348",919,"and  insatiable avarice.  Thus the prejudice developed into","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1349",919,"superstition, and took deep root in  the human mind; and for this","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1350",919,"reason everyone strove most zealously to understand and  explain","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1351",919,"the final causes of things; but in their endeavor to show that","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1352",919,"nature does nothing  in vain, i.e. nothing which is useless to","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1353",919,"man, they only seem to have demonstrated that  nature, the gods,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1354",919,"and men are all mad together.  Consider, I pray you, the result:","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1355",919,"among  the many helps of nature they were bound to find some","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1356",919,"hindrances, such as storms,  earthquakes, diseases, &c.:  so they","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1357",919,"declared that such things happen, because the gods  are angry at","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1358",919,"some wrong done to them by men, or at some fault committed in","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1359",919,"their  worship.  Experience day by day protested and showed by","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1360",919,"infinite examples, that good  and evil fortunes fall to the lot","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1361",919,"of pious and impious alike; still they would not abandon  their","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1362",919,"inveterate prejudice, for it was more easy for them to class such","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1363",919,"contradictions among  other unknown things of whose use they were","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1364",919,"ignorant, and thus to retain their actual and  innate condition","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1365",919,"of ignorance, than to destroy the whole fabric of their reasoning","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1366",919,"and start  afresh.  They therefore laid down as an axiom, that","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1367",919,"God's judgments far transcend human  understanding.  Such a","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1368",919,"doctrine might well have sufficed to conceal the truth from the","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1376",919,"","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1377",919,"I have now sufficiently explained my first point.  There is no","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1378",919,"need to show at length, that  nature has no particular goal in","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1379",919,"view, and that final causes are mere human figments.  This,  I","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1380",919,"think, is already evident enough, both from the causes and","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1381",919,"foundations on which I have  shown such prejudice to be based,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1382",919,"and also from Prop. xvi., and the Corollary of Prop.  xxxii.,","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1383",919,"and, in fact, all those propositions in which I have shown, that","Ethics — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
