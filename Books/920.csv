"21",920,"DEFINITIONS I.  By 'body' I mean a mode which expresses in a","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"22",920,"certain determinate manner the essence  of God, in so far as he","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"23",920,"is considered as an extended thing.  (See Pt. i., Prop. xxv.","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"26",920,"II.  I consider as belonging to the essence of a thing that,","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"27",920,"which being given, the thing is  necessarily given also, and,","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"31",920,"","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"32",920,"III. By 'idea,' I mean the mental conception which is formed by","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"36",920,"because the word perception  seems to imply that the mind is","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"37",920,"passive in respect to the object; whereas conception seems  to","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"39",920,"","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"40",920,"IV.  By 'an adequate idea,' I mean an idea which, in so far as","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"41",920,"it is considered in itself,  without relation to the object, has","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"81",920,"","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"82",920," PROPOSITIONS  I.  Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"83",920,"thinking thing.","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"84",920,"","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"85",920,">>>>>Proof--Particular thoughts, or this and that thought, are","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"86",920,"modes which, in a certain  conditioned manner, express the nature","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"87",920,"of God (Pt. i., Prop. xxv., Cor.).  God therefore  possesses the","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"88",920,"attribute (Pt. i., Def. v.) of which the concept is involved in","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"89",920,"all particular  thoughts, which latter are conceived thereby.","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"90",920,"Thought, therefore, is one of the infinite  attributes of God,","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"91",920,"which express God's eternal and infinite essence (Pt. i., Def.","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"92",920,"vi.).  In  other words, God is a thinking thing.  Q.E.D.","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"93",920,"","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"94",920,"*****Note--This proposition is also evident from the fact, that","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"95",920,"we are able to conceive  an infinite thinking being.  For, in","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"96",920,"proportion as a thinking being is conceived as thinking  more","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"97",920,"thoughts, so is it conceived as containing more reality or","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"98",920,"perfection.  Therefore a  being, which can think an infinite","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"99",920,"number of things in an infinite number of ways, is,","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"100",920,"necessarily, in respect of thinking, infinite.  As, therefore,","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"101",920,"from the consideration of  thought alone, we conceive an infinite","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"102",920,"being, thought is necessarily (Pt. i., Deff. iv. and vi.)  one of","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"116",920,"infinite number of things in  infinite ways, or (what is the same","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"117",920,"thing, by Prop. xvi., Part i.) can form the idea of his  essence,","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"118",920,"and of all things which necessarily follow therefrom.  Now all","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"119",920,"that is in the power  of God necessarily is (Pt. i., Prop.","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"120",920,"xxxv.).  Therefore, such an idea as we are considering","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"121",920,"necessarily is, and in God alone.  Q.E.D.  (Part i., Prop. xv.)","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"122",920,"","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"123",920,"*****Note--The multitude understand by the power of God the free","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"124",920,"will of God, and the  right over all things that exist, which","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"125",920,"latter are accordingly generally considered as  contingent.  For","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"126",920,"it is said that God has the power to destroy all things, and to","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"127",920,"reduce them  to nothing.  Further, the power of God is very often","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"128",920,"likened to the power of kings.  But  this doctrine we have","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"129",920,"refuted (Pt. i., Prop. xxxii., Cors. i. and ii.), and we have","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"130",920,"shown  (Part i., Prop. xvi.) that God acts by the same necessity,","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"131",920,"as that by which he understands  himself; in other words, as it","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"132",920,"follows from the necessity of the divine nature (as all admit),","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"133",920,"that God understands himself, so also does it follow by the same","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"134",920,"necessity, that God  performs infinite acts in infinite ways.  We","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"135",920,"further showed (Part i., Prop. xxxiv.), that  God's power is","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"136",920,"identical with God's essence in action; therefore it is as","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"137",920,"impossible for us  to conceive God as not acting, as to conceive","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"138",920,"him as non-existent.  If we might pursue  the subject further, I","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"139",920,"could point out, that the power which is commonly attributed to","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"140",920,"God  is not only human (as showing that God is conceived by the","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"141",920,"multitude as a man, or in the  likeness of a man), but involves a","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"142",920,"negation of power.  However, I am unwilling to go over  the same","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"165",920,">>>>>Proof--This proposition is evident from Prop. iii. of this","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"166",920,"Part.  We there drew the  conclusion, that God can form the idea","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"168",920,"therefrom, solely because he is a thinking thing, and not because","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"174",920,"nature of God, in so far as he is a thinking thing, and therefore","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"175",920,"(Part i., Prop. x.) involves the conception of no other attribute","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"176",920,"of God, and consequently  (by Part i., Ax. iv.) is not the effect","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"177",920,"of any attribute save thought.  Therefore the actual  being of","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1438",920,"can there be more clear, and more certain, than a true idea as a","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1450",920,"that he has ideas which agree with their objects?   These","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1451",920,"questions, I repeat, I have, in my opinion, sufficiently","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1452",920,"answered.  The difference  between a true idea and a false idea","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1457",920,"between a man who has true ideas, and a man who has only false","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1459",920,"man can be sure that he has ideas that agree with  their objects,","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1460",920,"I have just pointed out, with abundant clearness, that his","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1461",920,"knowledge arises  from the simple fact, that he has an idea which","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1462",920,"corresponds with its object--in other words,  that truth is its","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1480",920,"*****Note--How this way of looking at things arises, I will","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1481",920,"briefly explain.  We have  shown above (II. xvii. and Cor.) that","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1482",920,"the mind always regards things as present to itself,  even though","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1483",920,"they be not in existence, until some causes arise which exclude","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1484",920,"their existence  and presence.  Further (II. xviii.), we showed","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1485",920,"that, if the human body has once been  affected by two external","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1486",920,"bodies simultaneously, the mind, when it afterwards imagines one","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1487",920,"of the said external bodies, will straightway remember the","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1488",920,"other--that is, it will regard both  as present to itself, unless","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1489",920,"there arise causes which exclude their existence and presence.","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1490",920,"Further, no one doubts that we imagine time, from the fact that","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1743",920,"our doctrine.  Of these, the first is advanced by  those, who","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1744",920,"think that the will has a wider scope than the understanding, and","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1745",920,"that therefore  it is different therefrom.  The reason for their","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1746",920,"holding the belief, that the will has wider  scope than the","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1747",920,"understanding, is that they assert, that they have no need of an","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1748",920,"increase in  their faculty of assent, that is of affirmation or","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1749",920,"negation, in order to assent to an infinity of  things which we","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1755",920,"before assenting to things  which we perceive; this is confirmed","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1756",920,"by the fact that no one is said to be deceived, in so  far as he","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1757",920,"perceives anything, but only in so far as he assents or","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1759",920,"","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1765",920,"from the faculty of understanding.  Thirdly, it may  be objected","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1766",920,"that one affirmation does not apparently contain more reality","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1767",920,"than another; in  other words, that we do not seem to need for","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1768",920,"affirming, that what is true is true, any  greater power than for","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1769",920,"affirming, that what is false is true.  We have, however, seen","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1770",920,"that  one idea has more reality or perfection than another, for","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1772",920,"ideas of them some more excellent than others; this  also seems","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1790",920,"should be called infinite, any more  than the faculty of feeling:","Ethics — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
