"79",948,"distinctly understood.  On the other hand, I say that we","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"80",948,"are passive as regards something when that something","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"129",948,"adequate cause (III. Def. i.), not inasmuch as he is","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"130",948,"infinite, but inasmuch as he is conceived as affected by","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"131",948,"the given idea (II. ix.).  But of that effect whereof God","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"136",948,"(III. Def. ii.), is in certain cases necessarily active;","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"137",948,"this was our first point.  Again, whatsoever necessarily","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"217",948,"any rate, experience of the fact that unless the human mind","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"218",948,"is in a fit state to think, the body remains inert.  Moreover,","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"219",948,"we have experience, that the mind alone can determine","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"220",948,"whether we speak or are silent, and a variety of similar","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"221",948,"states which, accordingly, we say depend on the mind's","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"222",948,"decree.  But, as to the first point, I ask such objectors,","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"223",948,"whether experience does not also teach, that if the body","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"224",948,"be inactive the mind is simultaneously unfitted for","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"225",948,"thinking?  For when the body is at rest in sleep, the mind","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"226",948,"simultaneously is in a state of torpor also, and has no","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"227",948,"power of thinking, such as it possesses when the body","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"228",948,"is awake.  Again, I think everyone's experience will","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"229",948,"confirm the statement, that the mind is not at all times","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"230",948,"equally fit for thinking on a given subject, but according","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"234",948,"","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"236",948,"the laws of nature considered as extended substance,","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"240",948,"it were determined and led by the mind, be capable of","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"248",948,"by somnambulists while asleep, and wondered at by their","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"253",948,"from nature, under whatever attribute she be considered,","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"254",948,"infinite results follow.  As for the second objection, I","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"259",948,"easily than their appetites; when it comes about that many","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"260",948," believe, that we are only free in respect to objects which","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"261",948,"we moderately desire, because our desire for such can","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"262",948,"easily be controlled by the thought of something else","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"263",948,"frequently remembered, but that we are by no means free","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"264",948,"in respect to what we seek with violent emotion, for our","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"265",948,"desire cannot then be allayed with the remembrance of","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"266",948,"anything else.  However, unless such persons had proved","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"267",948,"by experience that we do many things which we afterwards","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"268",948,"repent of, and again that we often, when assailed by contrary","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"269",948,"emotions, see the better and follow the worse, there would","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"270",948,"be nothing to prevent their believing that we are free in all","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"271",948,"things.  Thus an infant believes that of its own free will it","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"272",948,"desires milk, an angry child believes that it freely desires","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"273",948,"to run away; further, a drunken man believes that he utters","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"274",948,"from the free decision of his mind words which, when he","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"275",948,"is sober, he would willingly have withheld:  thus, too, a","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"276",948,"delirious man, a garrulous woman, a child, and others","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"277",948,"of like complexion, believe that they speak from the free","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"278",948,"decision of their mind, when they are in reality unable to","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"279",948,"restrain their impulse to talk.  Experience teaches us no","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"280",948,"less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves to be","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"281",948,"free, simply because they are conscious of their actions,","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"282",948,"and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"283",948,"determined; and, further, it is plain that the dictates of the","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"284",948,"mind are but another name for the appetites, and therefore","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"285",948,"vary according to the varying state of the body.  Everyone","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"286",948,"shapes his actions according to his emotion, those who are","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"287",948,"assailed by conflicting emotions know not what they wish;","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"288",948,"those who are not attacked by any emotion are readily swayed","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"289",948,"this way or that.  All these considerations clearly show that","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"290",948,"a mental decision and a bodily appetite, or determined state,","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"291",948,"are simultaneous, or rather are one and the same thing, which","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"292",948,"we call decision, when it is regarded under and explained","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"293",948,"through the attribute of thought, and a conditioned state, when","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"294",948,"it is regarded under the attribute of extension, and deduced","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"295",948,"from the laws of motion and rest.  This will appear yet more","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"296",948,"plainly in the sequel.  For the present I wish to call attention","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"297",948,"to another point, namely, that we cannot act by the decision","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"298",948,"of the mind, unless we have a remembrance of having done","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"299",948,"so.  For instance, we cannot say a word without remembering","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"300",948,"that we have done so.  Again, it is not within the free power","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"301",948,"of the mind to remember or forget a thing at will.  Therefore","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"302",948,"the freedom of the mind must in any case be limited to the","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"303",948,"power of uttering or not uttering something which it remembers.","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"304",948,"But when we dream that we speak, we believe that we speak","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"305",948,"from a free decision of the mind, yet we do not speak, or, if we","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"306",948,"do, it is by a spontaneous motion of the body.  Again, we","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"307",948,"dream that we are concealing something, and we seem to act","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"308",948,"from the same decision of the mind as that, whereby we keep","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"309",948,"silence when awake concerning something we know.  Lastly,","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"310",948,"we dream that from the free decision of our mind we do","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"311",948,"something, which we should not dare to do when awake.","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"312",948,"","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"315",948,"If our folly does not carry us so far as this, we must necessarily","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"316",948,"admit, that the decision of the mind, which is believed to be","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"317",948,"free, is not distinguishable from the imagination or memory,","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"318",948,"and is nothing more than the affirmation, which an idea, by","Ethics — Part 3","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
