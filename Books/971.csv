"16",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"17",971,"Human infirmity in moderating and checking the emotions I name bondage:","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"18",971,"for, when a man is a prey to his emotions, he is not his own master, but","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"19",971,"lies at the mercy of fortune: so much so, that he is often compelled,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"20",971,"while seeing that which is better for him, to follow that which is worse.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"21",971,"Why this is so, and what is good or evil in the emotions, I propose to","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"22",971,"show in this part of my treatise. But, before I begin, it would be well","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"23",971,"to make a few prefatory observations on perfection and imperfection,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"24",971,"good and evil.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"25",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"26",971,"When a man has purposed to make a given thing, and has brought it","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"27",971,"to perfection, his work will be pronounced perfect, not only by","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"28",971,"himself, but by everyone who rightly knows, or thinks that he knows,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"29",971,"the intention and aim of its author. For instance, suppose anyone sees a","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"30",971,"work (which I assume to be not yet completed), and knows that the aim","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"31",971,"of the author of that work is to build a house, he will call the work","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"32",971,"imperfect; he will, on the other hand, call it perfect, as soon as he","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"33",971,"sees that it is carried through to the end, which its author had purposed","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"34",971,"for it. But if a man sees a work, the like whereof he has never seen","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"35",971,"before, and if he knows not the intention of the artificer, he plainly","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"36",971,"cannot know, whether that work be perfect or imperfect. Such seems to","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"37",971,"be the primary meaning of these terms.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"38",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"39",971,"But, after men began to form general ideas, to think out types of","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"40",971,"houses, buildings, towers, &c., and to prefer certain types to others,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"41",971,"it came about, that each man called perfect that which he saw agree","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"42",971,"with the general idea he had formed of the thing in question, and called","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"43",971,"imperfect that which he saw agree less with his own preconceived type,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"44",971,"even though it had evidently been completed in accordance with the idea","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"45",971,"of its artificer.  This seems to be the only reason for calling natural","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"46",971,"phenomena, which, indeed, are not made with human hands, perfect or","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"47",971,"imperfect: for men are wont to form general ideas of things natural, no","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"48",971,"less than of things artificial, and such ideas they hold as types,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"49",971,"believing that Nature (who they think does nothing without an object)","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"50",971,"has them in view, and has set them as types before herself. Therefore,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"51",971,"when they behold something in Nature, which does not wholly conform to","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"52",971,"the preconceived type which they have formed of the thing in question,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"53",971,"they say that Nature has fallen short or has blundered, and has left","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"54",971,"her work incomplete. Thus we see that men are wont to style natural","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"55",971,"phenomena perfect or imperfect rather from their own prejudices, than","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"56",971,"from true knowledge of what they pronounce upon.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"57",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"58",971,"Now we showed in the Appendix to Part I., that Nature does not work","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"59",971,"with an end in view. For the eternal and infinite Being, which we call","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"60",971,"God or Nature, acts by the same necessity as that whereby it exists. For","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"61",971,"we have shown, that by the same necessity of its nature, whereby it","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"62",971,"exists, it likewise works (I:xvi.). The reason or cause why God or Nature","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"63",971,"exists, and the reason why he acts, are one and the same.  Therefore,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"64",971,"as he does not exist for the sake of an end, so neither does he act for","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"65",971,"the sake of an end; of his existence and of his action there is neither","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"66",971,"origin nor end. Wherefore, a cause which is called final is nothing else","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"67",971,"but human desire, in so far as it is considered as the origin or cause","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"68",971,"of anything. For example, when we say that to be inhabited is the final","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"69",971,"cause of this or that house, we mean nothing more than that a man,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"70",971,"conceiving the conveniences of household life, had a desire to build a","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"71",971,"house. Wherefore, the being inhabited, in so far as it is regarded as","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"72",971,"a final cause, is nothing else but this particular desire, which is","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"73",971,"really the efficient cause; it is regarded as the primary cause,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"74",971,"because men are generally ignorant of the causes of their desires.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"75",971,"They are, as I have often said already, conscious of their own actions","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"76",971,"and appetites, but ignorant of the causes whereby they are determined","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"77",971,"to any particular desire. Therefore, the common saying that Nature","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"78",971,"sometimes falls short, or blunders, and produces things which are","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"79",971,"imperfect, I set down among the glosses treated of in the Appendix to","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"80",971,"Part 1.  Perfection and imperfection, then, are in reality merely modes","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"81",971,"of thinking, or notions which we form from a comparison among one","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"82",971,"another of individuals of the same species; hence I said above","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"83",971,"(II:Def.vi.), that by reality and perfection I mean the same thing.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"84",971,"For we are wont to refer all the individual things in nature to one","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"85",971,"genus, which is called the highest genus, namely, to the category of","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"86",971,"Being, whereto absolutely all individuals in nature belong. Thus, in","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"87",971,"so far as we refer the individuals in nature to this category, and","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"88",971,"comparing them one with another, find that some possess more of being or","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"89",971,"reality than others, we, to this extent, say that some are more perfect","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"90",971,"than others. Again, in so far as we attribute to them anything implying","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"91",971,"negation - as term, end, infirmity, etc., we, to this extent, call them","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"92",971,"imperfect, because they do not affect our mind so much as the things","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"93",971,"which we call perfect, not because they have any intrinsic deficiency,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"94",971,"or because Nature has blundered. For nothing lies within the scope of a","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"95",971,"thing's nature, save that which follows from the necessity of the nature","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"96",971,"of its efficient cause, and whatsoever follows from the necessity of the","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"97",971,"nature of its efficient cause necessarily comes to pass.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"98",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"99",971,"As for the terms good and bad, they indicate no positive quality in","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"100",971,"things regarded in themselves, but are merely modes of thinking, or","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"101",971,"notions which we form from the comparison of things one with another.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"102",971,"Thus one and the same thing can be at the same time good, bad, and","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"103",971,"indifferent. For instance, music is good for him that is melancholy,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"104",971,"bad for him that mourns; for him that is deaf, it is neither good nor","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"105",971,"bad.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"106",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"107",971,"Nevertheless, though this be so, the terms should still be retained.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"108",971,"For, inasmuch as we desire to form an idea of man as a type of human","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"109",971,"nature which we may hold in view, it will be useful for us to retain","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"110",971,"the terms in question, in the sense I have indicated.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"111",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"112",971,"In what follows, then, I shall mean by, ""good"" that, which we","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"113",971,"certainly know to be a means of approaching more nearly to the type","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"114",971,"of human nature, which we have set before ourselves; by ""bad,"" that","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"115",971,"which we certainly know to be a hindrance to us in approaching the","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"116",971,"said type.  Again, we shall that men are more perfect, or more imperfect,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"117",971,"in proportion as they approach more or less nearly to the said type.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"118",971,"For it must be specially remarked that, when I say that a man passes","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"119",971,"from a lesser to a greater perfection, or vice versa, I do not mean","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"120",971,"that he is changed from one essence or reality to another; for instance,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"121",971,"a horse would be as completely destroyed by being changed into a man,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"122",971,"as by being changed into an insect. What I mean is, that we conceive the","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"123",971,"thing's power of action, in so far as this is understood by its nature,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"124",971,"to be increased or diminished. Lastly, by perfection in general I shall,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"125",971,"as I have said, mean reality in other words, each thing's essence, in so","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"126",971,"far as it exists, and operates in a particular manner, and without paying","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"127",971,"any regard to its duration. For no given thing can be said to be more","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"128",971,"perfect, because it has passed a longer time in existence. The duration","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"129",971,"of things cannot be determined by their essence, for the essence of","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"130",971,"things involves no fixed and definite period of existence; but everything,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"131",971,"whether it be more perfect or less perfect, will always be able to persist","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"210",971,"distinctly, but confusedly; whence it comes to pass, that the mind is","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"211",971,"said to err. For instance, when we look at the sun, we conceive that it","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"212",971,"is distant from us about two hundred feet; in this judgment we err, so","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"213",971,"long as we are in ignorance of its true distance; when its true distance","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"216",971,"luminary, in so far as the body is affected thereby: wherefore, though","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"217",971,"we know the real distance, we shall still nevertheless imagine the sun","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"218",971,"to be near us. For, as we said in III:xxxv.note, we do not imagine the sun","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"219",971,"to be so near us, because we are ignorant of its true distance, but because","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"220",971,"the mind conceives the magnitude of the sun to the extent that the body is","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"221",971,"affected thereby.  Thus, when the rays of the sun falling on the surface of","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"226",971,"increased or diminished, are not contrary to the truth, and do not vanish","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"228",971,"the fear vanishes when we hear the true tidings; but the contrary also","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"229",971,"happens, namely, that we fear an evil which will certainly come, and our","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"230",971,"fear vanishes when we hear false tidings; thus imaginations do not vanish","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"231",971,"at the presence of the truth, in virtue of its being true, but because","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"275",971,"the nature of man, it would follow that he would not be able to die, but","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"276",971,"would always necessarily exist; this would be the necessary consequence","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"277",971,"of a cause whose power was either finite or infinite; namely, either of","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"281",971,"man should be incapable of undergoing any changes save such as tended","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"285",971,"capable of undergoing any changes, save such as can be explained solely","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"286",971,"through his own nature, and consequently that he must always (as we have","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"287",971,"shown) necessarily exist; such a result must follow from the infinite","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"288",971,"power of God, and consequently (I:xvi.) from the necessity of the divine","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"966",971,"contrary one to another. But the emotion of pain is always a passion","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"982",971,"at variance through both loving the same thing, and through the agreement","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1245",971,"Proof.- The human body needs many other bodies for its preservation","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1246",971,"(II:Post.iv.). But that which constitutes the specific reality (forma)","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1261",971,"Note.- The extent to which such causes can injure or be of service to the","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1262",971,"mind will be explained in the Fifth Part. But I would here remark that I","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1263",971,"consider that a body undergoes death, when the proportion of motion and","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1264",971,"rest which obtained mutually among its several parts is changed. For I do","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1265",971,"not venture to deny that a human body, while keeping the circulation of","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1266",971,"the blood and other properties, wherein the life of a body is thought to","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1267",971,"consist, may none the less be changed into another nature totally different","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1268",971,"from its own. There is no reason, which compels me to maintain that a body","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1269",971,"does not die, unless it becomes a corpse; nay, experience would seem to","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1270",971,"point to the opposite conclusion. It sometimes happens, that a man","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1589",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1590",971,"Proof.- The first part of this proposition is proved like the foregoing","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1594",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1595",971,"Note.- As men seldom live under the guidance of reason, these two emotions,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1596",971,"namely, Humility and Repentance, as also Hope and Fear, bring more good","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1597",971,"than harm; hence, as we must sin, we had better sin in that direction.","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1598",971,"For, if all men who are a prey to emotion were all equally proud, they","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1599",971,"would shrink from nothing, and would fear nothing; how then could they be","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1600",971,"joined and linked together in bonds of union?  The crowd plays the tyrant,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1612",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1619",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1620",971,"Proof.- The first foundation of virtue is self-preservation","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1621",971,"(IV:xxii.Coroll.) under the guidance of reason (IV:xxiv.). He, therefore,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1622",971,"who is ignorant of himself, is ignorant of the foundation of all virtues,","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1654",971,"silence the fact, that a man may be called proud from his underestimation","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1656",971,"pleasure arising from the false opinion, whereby a man may consider","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1657",971,"himself superior to his fellows. The dejection, which is the opposite","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1665",971,"Though dejection is the emotion contrary to pride, yet is the dejected","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1667",971,"from a comparison between his own infirmity and other men's power or","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1671",971,"Contrariwise, he will be the more pained in proportion as he thinks","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1695",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1696",971,"Proof.-This is evident from Def. of the Emotions:xxx., and also from the","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1714",971,"The points to note concerning shame (pudor) may easily be inferred","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1715",971,"from what was said on the subject of mercy and repentance. I will only","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1716",971,"add that shame, like compassion, though not a virtue, is yet good, in so","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1717",971,"far as it shows, that the feeler of shame is really imbued with the","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1737",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1738",971,"Proof.- To act rationally, is nothing else (III:iii. and III:Def.ii.)","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1739",971,"but to perform those actions, which follow from the necessity, of our","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1740",971,"nature {to persist} considered in itself alone. But pain is bad, in so","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1741",971,"far as it diminishes or checks the power of action (IV:xli.); wherefore","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1742",971,"we cannot by pain be determined to any action, which we should be unable","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1747",971,"in so far as it is good, is in harmony with reason (for it consists in the","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1760",971,"","Ethics — Part 4","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
