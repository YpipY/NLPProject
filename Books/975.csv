"14",975,"At length I pass to the remaining portion of my Ethics, which is concerned","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"15",975,"with the way leading to freedom. I shall therefore treat therein of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"16",975,"power of the reason, showing how far the reason can control the emotions,","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"17",975,"and what is the nature of Mental Freedom or Blessedness; we shall then be","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"18",975,"able to see, how much more powerful the wise man is than the ignorant.","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"19",975,"It is no part of my design to point out the method and means whereby the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"20",975,"understanding may be perfected, nor to show the skill whereby the body may","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"21",975,"be so tended, as to be capable of the due performance of its functions. The","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"22",975,"latter question lies in the province of Medicine, the former in the province","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"23",975,"of Logic. Here, therefore, I repeat, I shall treat only of the power of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"24",975,"mind, or of reason; and I shall mainly show the extent and nature of its","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"25",975,"dominion over the emotions, for their control and moderation. That we do","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"26",975,"not possess absolute dominion over them, I have already shown. Yet the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"27",975,"Stoics have thought, that the emotions depended absolutely on our will, and","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"28",975,"that we could absolutely govern them. But these philosophers were compelled,","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"29",975,"by the protest of experience, not from their own principles, to confess,","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"30",975,"that no slight practice and zeal is needed to control and moderate them:","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"31",975,"and this someone endeavoured to illustrate by the example (if I remember","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"32",975,"rightly) of two dogs, the one a house-dog and the other a hunting-dog. For","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"33",975,"by long training it could be brought about, that the house-dog should become","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"34",975,"accustomed to hunt, and the hunting-dog to cease from running after hares.","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"35",975,"To this opinion Descartes not a little inclines. For he maintained, that the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"36",975,"soul or mind is specially united to a particular part of the brain, namely,","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"37",975,"to that part called the pineal gland, by the aid of which the mind is","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"38",975,"enabled to feel all the movements which are set going in the body, and also","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"39",975,"external objects, and which the mind by a simple act of volition can put in","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"40",975,"motion in various ways. He asserted, that this gland is so suspended in the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"41",975,"midst of the brain, that it could be moved by the slightest motion of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"42",975,"animal spirits: further, that this gland is suspended in the midst of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"43",975,"brain in as many different manners, as the animal spirits can impinge","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"44",975,"thereon; and, again, that as many different marks are impressed on the said","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"45",975,"gland, as there are different external objects which impel the animal","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"46",975,"spirits towards it; whence it follows, that if the will of the soul suspends","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"47",975,"the gland in a position, wherein it has already been suspended once before","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"48",975,"by the animal spirits driven in one way or another, the gland in its turn","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"49",975,"reacts on the said spirits, driving and determining them to the condition","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"50",975,"wherein they were, when repulsed before by a similar position of the gland.","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"51",975,"He further asserted, that every act of mental volition is united in nature","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"52",975,"to a certain given motion of the gland. For instance, whenever anyone","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"53",975,"desires to look at a remote object, the act of volition causes the pupil of","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"54",975,"the eye to dilate, whereas, if the person in question had only thought of","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"55",975,"the dilatation of the pupil, the mere wish to dilate it would not have","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"56",975,"brought about the result, inasmuch as the motion of the gland, which serves","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"57",975,"to impel the animal spirits towards the optic nerve in a way which would","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"58",975,"dilate or contract the pupil, is not associated in nature with the wish to","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"59",975,"dilate or contract the pupil, but with the wish to look at remote or very","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"60",975,"near objects. Lastly, he maintained that, although every motion of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"61",975,"aforesaid gland seems to have been united by nature to one particular","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"62",975,"thought out of the whole number of our thoughts from the very beginning of","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"63",975,"our life, yet it can nevertheless become through habituation associated with","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"64",975,"other thoughts; this he endeavours to prove in the Passions de l'ame, I. 50.","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"65",975,"He thence concludes, that there is no soul so weak, that it cannot, under","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"66",975,"proper direction, acquire absolute power over its passions. For passions as","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"67",975,"defined by him are ""perceptions, or feelings, or disturbances of the soul,","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"68",975,"which are referred to the soul as species, and which (mark the expression)","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"69",975,"are produced, preserved, and strengthened through some movement of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"70",975,"spirits."" (Passion del l'ame,I.27.) But, seeing that we can join any motion","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"71",975,"of the gland, or consequently of the spirits, to any volition, the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"72",975,"determination of the will depends entirely on our own powers; if, therefore,","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"73",975,"we determine our will with sure and firm decisions in the direction to which","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"74",975,"we wish our actions to tend, and associate the motions of the passions which","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"75",975,"we wish to acquire with the said decisions, we shall acquire an absolute","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"76",975,"dominion over our passions. Such is the doctrine of this illustrious","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"77",975,"philosopher (in so far as I gather it from his own words); it is one","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"78",975,"which, had it been less ingenious, I could hardly believe to have proceeded","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"79",975,"from so great a man. Indeed, I am lost in wonder, that a philosopher, who","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"80",975,"had stoutly asserted, that he would draw no conclusions which do not follow","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"81",975,"from self-evident premisses, and would affirm nothing which he did not","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"82",975,"clearly and distinctly perceive, and who had so often taken to task the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"83",975,"scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through occult qualities,","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"84",975,"could maintain a hypothesis, beside which occult qualities are commonplace.","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"85",975,"What does he understand, I ask, by the union of the mind and the body? What","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"86",975,"clear and distinct conception has he got of thought in most intimate union","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"87",975,"with a certain particle of extended matter? Truly I should like him to","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"88",975,"explain this union through its proximate cause. What clear and distinct","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"89",975,"conception has he got of thought in most intimate union with a certain","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"90",975,"particle of extended matter? What clear and distinct conception has he got","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"91",975,"of thought in most intimate union with a certain particle of extended","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"92",975,"matter? But he had so distinct a conception of mind being distinct from","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"93",975,"body, that he could not assign any particular cause of the union between the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"94",975,"two, or of the mind itself, but was obliged to have recourse to the cause of","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"95",975,"the whole universe, that is to God. Further, I should much like to know,","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"96",975,"what degree of motion the mind can impart to this pineal gland, and with","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"97",975,"what force can it hold it suspended? For I am in ignorance, whether this","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"98",975,"gland can be agitated more slowly or more quickly by the mind than by the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"99",975,"animal spirits, and whether the motions of the passions, which we have","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"100",975,"closely united with firm decisions, cannot be again disjoined therefrom by","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"101",975,"physical causes; in which case it would follow that, although the mind","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"102",975,"firmly intended to face a given danger, and had united to this decision the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"103",975,"motions of boldness, yet at the sight of the danger the gland might become","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"104",975,"suspended in a way, which would preclude the mind thinking of anything","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"105",975,"except running away. In truth, as there is no common standard of volition","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"106",975,"and motion, so is there no comparison possible between the powers of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"107",975,"mind and the power or strength of the body; consequently the strength of one","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"108",975,"cannot in any wise be determined by the strength of the other. We may also","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"109",975,"add, that there is no gland discoverable in the midst of the brain, so","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"110",975,"placed that it can thus easily be set in motion in so many ways, and also","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"111",975,"that all the nerves are not prolonged so far as the cavities of the brain.","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"112",975,"Lastly, I omit all the assertions which he makes concerning the will and its","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"113",975,"freedom, inasmuch as I have abundantly proved that his premisses are false.","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"114",975,"Therefore, since the power of the mind, as I have shown above, is defined by","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"115",975,"the understanding only, we shall determine solely by the knowledge of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"138",975,"","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"139",975,"Proof.- The order and connection of ideas is the same (II:vii.) as the order","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"151",975,"from the thought of an external cause, and unite it to other","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"200",975,"things which it clearly and distinctly perceives, and wherein it fully","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"201",975,"acquiesces: and thus that the emotion itself may be separated from the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"204",975,"destroyed (V:ii.), but also that the appetites or desires, which are wont to","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"208",975,"and the same. For instance, we have shown that human nature is so","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"209",975,"constituted, that everyone desires his fellow-men to live after his own","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"211",975,"appetite is a passion which is called ambition, and does not greatly differ","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"213",975,"activity or virtue which is called piety (IV:xxxvii.Note.i. and second","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"214",975,"proof). In like manner all appetites or desires are only passions, in so far","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"215",975,"as they spring from inadequate ideas; the same results are accredited to","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"216",975,"virtue, when they are aroused or generated by adequate ideas. For all","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"220",975,"true knowledge thereof, nothing more excellent, being within our power, can","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"221",975,"be devised. For the mind has no other power save that of thinking and of","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"340",975,"imagination may become fully imbued therewith, and that it may be always","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"341",975,"ready to our hand. For instance, we have laid down among the rules of life","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"344",975,"of reason may be always ready to our hand in time of need, we should often","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"346",975,"what manner and way they may be best warded off by high-mindedness: we shall","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"357",975,"nevertheless be overcome, though not without a spiritual conflict, far","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"358",975,"sooner than if we had not thus reflected on the subject beforehand. As is","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"359",975,"indeed evident from V:vi.,V:vii.,V:viii. We should, in the same way, reflect","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"360",975,"on courage as a means of overcoming fear; the ordinary dangers of life","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"361",975,"should frequently be brought to mind and imagined, together with the means","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"362",975,"whereby through readiness of resource and strength of mind we can avoid and","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"364",975,"conceptions we should always bear in mind that which is good in every","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"365",975,"individual thing (IV:lxiii.Coroll. and III:lix.), in order that we may","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"366",975,"always be determined to action by an emotion of pleasure. For instance, if","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"367",975,"a man sees that he is too keen in the pursuit of honour, let him think over","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"368",975,"its right use, the end for which it should be pursued, and the means whereby","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"369",975,"he may attain it. Let him not think of its misuse, and its emptiness, and","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"370",975,"the fickleness of mankind, and the like, whereof no man thinks except","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"371",975,"through a morbidness of disposition; with thoughts like these do the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"372",975,"most ambitious most torment themselves, when they despair of gaining the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"373",975,"distinctions they hanker after, and in thus giving vent to their anger would","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"374",975,"fain appear wise. Wherefore it is certain that those, who cry out the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"375",975,"loudest against the misuse of honour and the vanity of the world, are those","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"376",975,"who most greedily covet it. This is not peculiar to the ambitious, but is","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"377",975,"common to all who are ill-used by fortune, and who are infirm in spirit.","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"378",975,"For a poor man also, who is miserly, will talk incessantly of the misuse of","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"542",975,"But, in order that this power of the mind over the emotions may be better","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"543",975,"understood, it should be specially observed that the emotions are called by","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"544",975,"us strong, when we compare the emotion of one man with the emotion of","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"545",975,"another, and see that one man is more troubled than another by the same","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"546",975,"emotion; or when we are comparing the various emotions of the same man one","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"547",975,"with another, and find that he is more affected or stirred by one emotion","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"548",975,"than by another. For the strength of every emotion is defined by a","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"549",975,"comparison of our own power with the power of an external cause. Now the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"550",975,"power of the mind is defined by knowledge only, and its infirmity or passion","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"551",975,"is defined by the privation of knowledge only: it therefore follows, that","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"552",975,"that mind is most passive, whose greatest part is made up of inadequate","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"553",975,"ideas, so that it may be characterized more readily by its passive states","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"554",975,"than by its activities: on the other hand, that mind is most active, whose","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"555",975,"greatest part is made up of adequate ideas, so that, although it may contain","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"556",975,"as many inadequate ideas as the former mind, it may yet be more easily","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"557",975,"characterized by ideas attributable to human virtue, than by ideas which","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"558",975,"tell of human infirmity. Again, it must be observed, that spiritual","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"559",975,"unhealthiness; and misfortunes can generally be traced to excessive love for","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"560",975,"something which is subject to many variations, and which we can never become","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"561",975,"masters of. For no one is solicitous or anxious about anything, unless he","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"564",975,"","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"575",975,"that concerns this present life: for, as I said in the beginning of this","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"578",975,"what is advanced in the present note, and also to the definitions of the","Ethics — Part 5","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
