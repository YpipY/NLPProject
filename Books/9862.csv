"293",9862,"violence with the nitrogen of the atmosphere, leaving only a harmless","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"294",9862,"residue. We wired the surrounding region for the electrical discharge","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"298",9862,"issued. Again we set up our electrical machinery and dropped our cables","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"303",9862,"let down a cable and succeeded in getting but a faint reaction at the","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"306",9862,"Upon arrival at the bottom we were surprised to find it free from water,","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"308",9862,"of huddled skeletons of the workmen who had perished over a century","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"325",9862,"decided to make the first attack on the Germans as a private enterprise","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"326",9862,"and then call for military aid. I had my own equipment of poisonous","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"327",9862,"bombs and my sapping and mining experts determined that the German","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"332",9862,"After twenty hours of boring, the drill head suddenly came off and","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"338",9862,"perhaps that I should have called for military aid, but the uncanny","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"339",9862,"silence of the lower workings proved too much for my eager curiosity. We","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"340",9862,"waited two days and still there was no evidence of life below. I knew","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"427",9862,"for thirty hours and had not tasted food or drink for nearly forty","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"428",9862,"hours. Clearly I had to get myself in shape to escape hallucinations. I","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"429",9862,"went back to the shelves and proceeded to look for food and drink.","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"430",9862,"Happily, due to my work in my uncle's laboratory, these synthetic foods","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"431",9862,"were not wholly strange to me. I drank copiously of a non-alcoholic","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"432",9862,"chemical liquor and warmed on the heater and partook of some nitrogenous","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"434",9862,"soon conquers mere emotion, and I made out a meal. Then once more I","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"439",9862,"reassured myself of the closeness of the resemblance. My purpose framed","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"440",9862,"in my mind as I did this. Clearly I was in German quarters and was","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"441",9862,"likely to remain there. Sooner or later there must be a rescuing party.","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"442",9862,"","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"443",9862,"Without further ado, I set about changing my clothing for that of the","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"444",9862,"German. The fit of the dead man's clothes further emphasized the closeness","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"454",9862,"unexplored passage-way. I followed this and presently came upon another","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"455",9862,"chamber filled with machinery. In one corner a huge engine, covered with","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"456",9862,"frost, gave off a chill greeting. On the floor was a steaming puddle of","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"457",9862,"liquid, but the breath of this steam cut like a blizzard. At once I","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"458",9862,"guessed it. This was a liquid air engine. The dead engineer in the","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"459",9862,"corner helped reveal the story. With his death from the penetrating gas,","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"460",9862,"something had gone wrong with the engine. The turbine head had blown","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"461",9862,"off, and the conveying pipe of liquid air had poured forth the icy blast","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"462",9862,"that had so nearly frozen me along with the corpses of the Germans. But","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"463",9862,"now the flow of liquid had ceased, and the last remnants were","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"464",9862,"evaporating from the floor. Evidently the supply pipe had been shut off","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"465",9862,"further back on the line, and I had little time to lose for rescuers","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"989",9862,"tendency to congest in cities had long since been overcome, I was","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"990",9862,"staggered by the fact that nearly as many people were living in this one","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"1004",9862,"five men. Inspection of the birth rate showed an even higher proportion","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"1005",9862,"of males. I consulted further tables that gave births by sexes and","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"1006",9862,"groups. These varied somewhat but there was this great preponderance of","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"8491",9862,"weigher's records had seemingly cleared me, but I knew that Grauble had","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
"8492",9862,"seen the weak spot in the German logic of the stupid official, who had","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"8494",9862,"Grauble had guessed the full truth and connected this uncertainty of my","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"

"8496",9862,"Even though he might be willing to discuss rebellious plans with a","City of Endless Night","Hastings, Milo","Science Fiction","en"
