"280",990,"phenomenon which we cannot understand, we can gain no knowledge of God's","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"288",990,"so far as our understanding goes, those phenomena which we clearly and","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"298",990,"expressing ignorance. (38) Again, even supposing that some conclusion could","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"308",990,"shown, extend over infinity, and are conceived by us as, after a fashion,","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"339",990,"to surpass, human comprehension. (45) Before passing on to my third point, I","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"340",990,"will adduce Scriptural authority for my assertion that God cannot be known","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"342",990,"readily be inferred from several passages. (47) Firstly, that in which Moses","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"343",990,"commands (Deut. xiii.) that a false prophet should be put to death, even","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"344",990,"though he work miracles: ""If there arise a prophet among you, and giveth","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"346",990,"go after other gods . . . thou shalt not hearken unto the voice of that","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"347",990,"prophet; for the Lord your God proveth you, and that prophet shall be put to","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"348",990,"death."" (48) From this it clearly follows that miracles could be wrought","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"349",990,"even by false prophets; and that, unless men are honestly endowed with the","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"943",990,"in the history of Scripture, we seek first for that which is most universal,","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"945",990,"fact, that is commended by all the prophets as eternal and most profitable","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"972",990,"God and His righteousness, which is commended as the highest good (see","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1030",990,"of a particular revelation, prophecy, history, or miracle. (70) We have","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1031",990,"already pointed out that great caution is necessary not to confound the mind","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1032",990,"of a prophet or historian with the mind of the Holy Spirit and the truth","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1033",990,"of the matter; therefore I need not dwell further on the subject. (71) I","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1034",990,"would, however, here remark concerning the meaning of revelation, that the","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 2","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
