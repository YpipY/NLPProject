"83",1016,"[2]  (1) I say ""I finally resolved,"" for at first sight it seemed","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"84",1016,"unwise willingly to lose hold on what was sure for the sake of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"85",1016,"something then uncertain.  (2) I could see the benefits which are","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"87",1016,"abandon the quest of such objects, if I seriously devoted myself","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"89",1016,"that if true happiness chanced to be placed in the former I should","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"98",1016,"esteemed by men (as their actions testify) to be the highest","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"99",1016,"good, may be classed under the three heads--Riches, Fame, and","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"100",1016,"the Pleasures of Sense: with these three the mind is so absorbed","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"103",1016,"[4]  (1) By sensual pleasure the mind is enthralled to the extent","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"104",1016,"of quiescence, as if the supreme good were actually attained, so","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"107",1016,"melancholy, whereby the mind, though not enthralled, is disturbed","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"108",1016,"and dulled.  (2) The pursuit of honors and riches is likewise very","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"109",1016,"absorbing, especially if such objects be sought simply for their","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"112",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"113",1016,"[5]  (1) In the case of fame the mind is still more absorbed, for fame","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"114",1016,"is conceived as always good for its own sake, and as the ultimate end","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"115",1016,"to which all actions are directed.  (2) Further, the attainment of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"116",1016,"riches and fame is not followed as in the case of sensual pleasures by","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"120",1016,"plunged into the deepest sadness.  (3) Fame has the further drawback","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"121",1016,"that it compels its votaries to order their lives according to the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"125",1016,"[6]  (1) When I saw that all these ordinary objects of desire would","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"128",1016,"have to be abandoned, I was forced to inquire which would prove the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"129",1016,"most useful to me: for, as I say, I seemed to be willingly losing","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"130",1016,"hold on a sure good for the sake of something uncertain.  (6:2) However,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"131",1016,"after I had reflected on the matter, I came in the first place to the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"132",1016,"conclusion that by abandoning the ordinary objects of pursuit, and","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"133",1016,"betaking myself to a new quest, I should be leaving a good, uncertain","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"134",1016,"by reason of its own nature, as may be gathered from what has been","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"135",1016,"said, for the sake of a good not uncertain in its nature (for I sought","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"136",1016,"for a fixed good), but only in the possibility of its attainment.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"138",1016,"[7] (1) Further reflection convinced me that if I could really get","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"139",1016,"to the root of the matter I should be leaving certain evils for a","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"140",1016,"certain good.  (2) I thus perceived that I was in a state of great","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"141",1016,"peril, and I compelled myself to seek with all my strength for a","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"142",1016,"remedy, however uncertain it might be; as a sick man struggling with","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"162",1016,"object which we love.  (2) When a thing is not loved, no quarrels will","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"441",1016,"from its correlate, it is capable of being understood through itself;","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"459",1016,"make trial of for himself, by reflecting that he knows what","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"462",1016,"order to understand the actual Peter, it is not necessary first","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"635",1016,"we have, first, defined the end to which we desire to direct all our","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"640",1016,"pursuing its inquiries according to fixed rules.  (49:3) Now, in order","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"641",1016,"that it may thus proceed, our method must furnish us, first, with a","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"642",1016,"means of distinguishing a true idea from all other perceptions, and","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"643",1016,"enabling the mind to avoid the latter; secondly, with rules for","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"651",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"652",1016,"[50] (1) Let us then make a beginning with the first part of the method,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"653",1016,"which is, as we have said, to distinguish and separate the true idea","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"654",1016,"from other perceptions, and to keep the mind from confusing with true","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"655",1016,"ideas those which are false, fictitious, and doubtful.  (2) I intend to","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"656",1016,"dwell on this point at length, partly to keep a distinction so necessary","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"657",1016,"before the reader's mind, and also because there are some who doubt of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"658",1016,"true ideas, through not having attended to the distinction between a true","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"659",1016,"perception and all others.  (3) Such persons are like men who, while they","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"660",1016,"are awake, doubt not that they are awake, but afterwards in a dream, as","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"661",1016,"often happens, thinking that they are surely awake, and then finding that","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"662",1016,"they were in error, become doubtful even of being awake.  (4) This state","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"663",1016,"of mind arises through neglect of the distinction between sleeping and","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"664",1016,"waking.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"665",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"667",1016,"essence of every perception, and explain it through its proximate","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"668",1016,"cause.  (2) Such work lies in the province of philosophy.  (3) I shall","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"669",1016,"confine myself to what concerns method--that is, to the character of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"670",1016,"fictitious, false and doubtful perceptions, and the means of freeing","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"671",1016,"ourselves therefrom.  (4) Let us then first inquire into the nature of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"672",1016,"a fictitious idea.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"673",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"674",1016,"[52]  (1) Every perception has for its object either a thing considered","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"675",1016,"as existing, or solely the essence of a thing.  (2) Now ""fiction"" is","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"676",1016,"chiefly occupied with things considered as existing.  (3) I will,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"677",1016,"therefore, consider these first--I mean cases where only the existence","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"678",1016,"of an object is feigned, and the thing thus feigned is understood, or","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"679",1016,"assumed to be understood.  (4) For instance, I feign that Peter, whom","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"680",1016,"I know to have gone home, is gone to see me, [r] or something of that","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"681",1016,"kind.  (5) With what is such an idea concerned?  (6) It is concerned","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"682",1016,"with things possible, and not with things necessary or impossible.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"683",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"684",1016,"[53] (1) I call a thing impossible when its existence would imply a","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"685",1016,"contradiction; necessary, when its non-existence would imply a","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"686",1016,"contradiction; possible, when neither its existence nor its","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"687",1016,"non-existence imply a contradiction, but when the necessity or","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"688",1016,"impossibility of its nature depends on causes unknown to us, while","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"689",1016,"we feign that it exists.  (2) If the necessity or impossibility of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"690",1016,"its existence depending on external causes were known to us, we","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"691",1016,"could not form any fictitious hypotheses about it;","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"692",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"693",1016,"[54] (1) Whence it follows that if there be a God, or omniscient","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"694",1016,"Being, such an one cannot form fictitious hypotheses.  (2) For,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"695",1016,"as regards ourselves, when I know that I exist, [s] I cannot","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"696",1016,"hypothesize that I exist or do not exist, any more than I can","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"697",1016,"hypothesize an elephant that can go through the eye of a needle;","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"698",1016,"nor when I know the nature of God, can I hypothesize that He","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"699",1016,"or does not exist. [t]  (54:3) The same thing must be said of the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"700",1016,"Chimaera, whereof the nature implies a contradiction.  (4) From","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"701",1016,"these considerations, it is plain, as I have already stated, that","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"702",1016,"fiction cannot be concerned with eternal truths. [u]","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"703",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"704",1016,"[55]  (1) But before proceeding further, I must remark, in passing,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"705",1016,"that the difference between the essence of one thing and the essence","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"706",1016,"of another thing is the same as that which exists between the reality","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"707",1016,"or existence of one thing and the reality or existence of another;","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"708",1016,"therefore, if we wished to conceive the existence, for example,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"709",1016,"of Adam, simply by means of existence in general, it would be the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"710",1016,"same as if, in order to conceive his existence, we went back to the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"711",1016,"nature of being, so as to define Adam as a being.  (2) Thus, the more","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"712",1016,"existence is conceived generally, the more is it conceived confusedly","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"713",1016,"and the more easily can it be ascribed to a given object.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"714",1016,"(55:3) Contrariwise, the more it is conceived particularly, the more","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"715",1016,"is it understood clearly, and the less liable is it to be ascribed,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"716",1016,"through negligence of Nature's order, to anything save its proper","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"717",1016,"object.  (4) This is worthy of remark.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"718",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"719",1016,"[56]  (1) We now proceed to consider those cases which are commonly","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"720",1016,"called fictions, though we clearly understood that the thing is not","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"721",1016,"as we imagine it.  (2) For instance, I know that the earth is round,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"722",1016,"but nothing prevents my telling people that it is a hemisphere,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"723",1016,"and that it is like a half apple carved in relief on a dish; or,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"724",1016,"that the sun moves round the earth, and so on.  (56:3) However,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"725",1016,"examination will show us that there is nothing here inconsistent","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"726",1016,"with what has been said, provided we first admit that we may have","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"727",1016,"made mistakes, and be now conscious of them; and, further, that we","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"728",1016,"can hypothesize, or at least suppose, that others are under the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"729",1016,"same mistake as ourselves, or can, like us, fall under it.  (4) We can,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"730",1016,"I repeat, thus hypothesize so long as we see no impossibility.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"731",1016,"(56:5) Thus, when I tell anyone that the earth is not round, &c.,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"732",1016,"I merely recall the error which I perhaps made myself, or which I","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"733",1016,"might have fallen into, and afterwards I hypothesize that the person","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"734",1016,"to whom I tell it, is still, or may still fall under the same mistake.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"735",1016,"(6) This I say, I can feign so long as I do not perceive any","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"739",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"740",1016,"[57]  (1) It remains for us to consider hypotheses made in problems,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"741",1016,"which sometimes involve impossibilities.  (2) For instance, when we","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"743",1016,"let us assume that it burns in some imaginary space, or where there","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"744",1016,"are no physical objects.  (3) Such assumptions are freely made,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"745",1016,"though the last is clearly seen to be impossible.  (4) But, though","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"746",1016,"this be so, there is no fiction in the case.  (57:5) For, in the first","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"747",1016,"case, I have merely recalled to memory, [x] another candle not","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"748",1016,"burning, or conceived the candle before me as without a flame, and","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"835",1016,"other ideas be deduced therefrom, our hurry to form fictitious ideas","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"836",1016,"will gradually subside.  (2) Further, as a fictitious idea cannot be","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"837",1016,"clear and distinct, but is necessarily confused, and as all confusion","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"838",1016,"arises from the fact that the mind has only partial knowledge of a","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"840",1016,"known and the unknown, and, again, that it directs its attention","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"841",1016,"promiscuously to all parts of an object at once without making","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"842",1016,"distinctions, it follows, first, that if the idea be of something","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"847",1016,"[64]  (1) Secondly, it follows that if a complex object be divided by","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"848",1016,"thought into a number of simple component parts, and if each be","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"849",1016,"regarded separately, all confusion will disappear.  (2) Thirdly, it","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"850",1016,"follows that fiction cannot be simple, but is made up of the blending","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"851",1016,"of several confused ideas of diverse objects or actions existent in","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"857",1016,"would be clear and distinct, and therefore true.  (4) For instance,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"862",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"863",1016,"[65] (1) Let us shortly come to our conclusion, and again repeat","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"864",1016,"that we need have no fear of confusing with true ideas that which","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"865",1016,"is only a fiction.  (2) As for the first sort of fiction of which","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"866",1016,"we have already spoken, when a thing is clearly conceived, we saw","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"872",1016,"fiction, which we stated to be the result of simultaneously","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"873",1016,"directing the attention, without the assent of the intellect,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"874",1016,"to different confused ideas representing different things and","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"875",1016,"actions existing in nature, we have seen that an absolutely","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"876",1016,"simple thing cannot be feigned, but must be understood, and that","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1119",1016,"[81]  (1) These are the points I promised to discuss in the first part","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1121",1016,"which can conduce to the knowledge of the understanding and its","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1125",1016,"(81:3) The point most worthy of attention is, that memory is","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1129",1016,"forget it.  (5) For instance, a number of unconnected words is much","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1130",1016,"more difficult to remember than the same number in the form of a","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1134",1016,"understanding by means of the power wherewith the imagination or","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1135",1016,"the sense called common, is affected by some particular physical","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1136",1016,"object.  (2) I say particular, for the imagination is only affected","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1137",1016,"by particular objects.  (3) If we read, for instance, a single romantic","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1144",1016,"strengthened both with and without the aid of the understanding,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1145",1016,"we may conclude that it is different from the understanding,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1151",1016,"thought of a definite duration, [83d] of the sensation.  (3) This","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1152",1016,"is also shown by reminiscence.  (4) For then we think of the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1153",1016,"sensation, but without the notion of continuous duration; thus the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1154",1016,"idea of that sensation is not the actual duration of the sensation","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1157",1016,"absurd to anyone, it will be sufficient for our purpose, if he","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1158",1016,"reflect on the fact that a thing is more easily remembered in","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1159",1016,"proportion to its singularity, as appears from the example of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1160",1016,"the comedy just cited.  (83:7) Further, a thing is remembered more","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1161",1016,"easily in proportion to its intelligibility; therefore we cannot","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1185",1016,"[85] (1) As regards as a true idea, we have shown that it is simple","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1188",1016,"correspond to the actual reality of its object.  (2) This conclusion","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1193",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1194",1016,"[86]  (1) Hence, as far as is possible at the outset, we have","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1195",1016,"acquired a knowledge of our understanding, and such a standard of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1196",1016,"a true idea that we need no longer fear confounding truth with","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1200",1016,"wholly opposed to the understanding, or others, again, which","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1201",1016,"agree therewith.  (3) We now know that the operations, whereby the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1202",1016,"effects of imagination are produced, take place under other laws","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1224",1016,"imagination, not as existing in the understanding.  (2) This is","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1228",1016,"conceptions really affirmative are expressed negatively, and vice","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1230",1016,"inasmuch as their contraries are much more easily imagined, and,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1238",1016,"which prevents the understanding from reflecting on itself.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1246",1016,"part of this method, I shall first set forth the object aimed at,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1247",1016,"and next the means for its attainment.  (2) The object aimed at","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1248",1016,"is the acquisition of clear and distinct ideas, such as are","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1249",1016,"produced by the pure intellect, and not by chance physical motions.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1251",1016,"endeavor so to associate and arrange them that our mind may, as far","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1252",1016,"as possible, reflect subjectively the reality of nature, both as","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1254",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1255",1016,"[92] (1) As for the first point, it is necessary (as we have said)","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1256",1016,"for our purpose that everything should be conceived, either solely","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1257",1016,"through its essence, or through its proximate cause.  (2) If the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1258",1016,"thing be self-existent, or, as is commonly said, the cause of","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1259",1016,"itself, it must be understood through its essence only; if it be","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1260",1016,"not self-existent, but requires a cause for its existence, it must","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1261",1016,"be understood through its proximate cause.  (3) For, in reality,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1262",1016,"the knowledge, [92f] of an effect is nothing else than the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1263",1016,"acquisition of more perfect knowledge of its cause.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1265",1016,"[93] (1) Therefore, we may never, while we are concerned with","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1266",1016,"inquiries into actual things, draw any conclusion from","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1267",1016,"abstractions; we shall be extremely careful not to confound that","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1268",1016,"which is only in the understanding with that which is in the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1269",1016,"thing itself. (2) The best basis for drawing a conclusion will","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1270",1016,"be either some particular affirmative essence, or a true and","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1271",1016,"legitimate definition.  (93:3) For the understanding cannot descend","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1272",1016,"from universal axioms by themselves to particular things, since","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1273",1016,"axioms are of infinite extent, and do not determine the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1277",1016,"[94] (1) Thus the true method of discovery is to form thoughts","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1278",1016,"from some given definition.  (2) This process will be the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1279",1016,"more fruitful and easy in proportion as the thing given be","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1280",1016,"better defined.  (3) Wherefore, the cardinal point of all this","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1281",1016,"second part of method consists in the knowledge of the conditions","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1305",1016,"[96]  In order to be free from this fault, the following rules","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1306",1016,"should be observed in definition:--","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1307",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1308",1016,"I.  (1) If the thing in question be created, the definition","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1309",1016,"   must (as we have said) comprehend the proximate cause.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1310",1016,"   (2) For instance, a circle should, according to this rule,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1311",1016,"   be defined as follows: the figure described by any line","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1314",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1315",1016,"II.  (4) A conception or definition of a thing should be such","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1316",1016,"   that all the properties of that thing, in so far as it is","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1317",1016,"   considered by itself, and not in conjunction with other","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1318",1016,"   things, can be deduced from it, as may be seen in the","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1319",1016,"   definition given of a circle: for from that it clearly follows","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1322",1016,"   characteristic of a definition is so clear to anyone, who","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1325",1016,"   condition, every definition should be affirmative.  (6) I","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1327",1016,"   verbal affirmations which, owing to the poverty of language,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1333",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1334",1016,"I.  The exclusion of all idea of cause--that is, the thing","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1335",1016,"   must not need explanation by Anything outside itself.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1336",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1337",1016,"II. When the definition of the thing has been given, there must","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1338",1016,"   be no room for doubt as to whether the thing exists or not.","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1339",1016,"","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1340",1016,"III. It must contain, as far as the mind is concerned, no","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1341",1016,"   substantives which could be put into an adjectival form;","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1342",1016,"   in other words, the object defined must not be explained","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1359",1016,"in which they should be arranged and united, it is necessary that,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1360",1016,"as soon as is possible and rational, we should inquire whether","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1361",1016,"there be any being (and, if so, what being), that is the cause","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1387",1016,"[101] (1) Neither is there any need that we should understand","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1389",1016,"not to be gathered from their series or order of existence,","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1405",1016,"understood, before another, as we have stated, should not be sought","On the Improvement of the Understanding","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
