"70",1076,"by the brigand, along a very difficult and bewildering path, until they","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"71",1076,"reached a cave hidden among the crags. Here Lin Yi called out some words","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"72",1076,"in the Miaotze tongue, whereupon a follower appeared, and opened a gate","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"73",1076,"in the stockade of prickly mimosa which guarded the mouth of the den.","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"74",1076,"Within the enclosure a fire burned, and food was being prepared. At a","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"75",1076,"word from the chief, the unfortunate Kai Lung found his hands seized and","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"76",1076,"tied behind his back, while a second later a rough hemp rope was fixed","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"87",1076,"","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"88",1076,"To this Kai Lung made no reply, chiefly because at that moment the wind","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"89",1076,"swayed the tree, and compelled him to stand on his toes in order to","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"90",1076,"escape suffocation.","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"91",1076,"","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"92",1076,"""It would be useless to try to conceal from a person of your inspired","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"93",1076,"intelligence that I am indeed Lin Yi,"" continued the robber. ""It is a","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"94",1076,"dignified position to occupy, and one for which I am quite incompetent.","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"95",1076,"In the sixth month of the third year ago, it chanced that this unworthy","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"96",1076,"person, at that time engaged in commercial affairs at Knei Yang, became","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"97",1076,"inextricably immersed in the insidious delights of quail-fighting.","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"98",1076,"Having been entrusted with a large number of taels with which to","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"99",1076,"purchase elephants' teeth, it suddenly occurred to him that if he","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"100",1076,"doubled the number of taels by staking them upon an exceedingly powerful","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"101",1076,"and agile quail, he would be able to purchase twice the number of teeth,","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"102",1076,"and so benefit his patron to a large extent. This matter was clearly","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"103",1076,"forced upon his notice by a dream, in which he perceived one whom he","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"104",1076,"then understood to be the benevolent spirit of an ancestor in the act","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"105",1076,"of stroking a particular quail, upon whose chances he accordingly","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"106",1076,"placed all he possessed. Doubtless evil spirits had been employed in the","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"107",1076,"matter; for, to this person's great astonishment, the quail in question","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"108",1076,"failed in a very discreditable manner at the encounter. Unfortunately,","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"109",1076,"this person had risked not only the money which had been entrusted to","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"110",1076,"him, but all that he had himself become possessed of by some years of","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"111",1076,"honourable toil and assiduous courtesy as a professional witness in","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"122",1076,"reply which this person received showed him plainly that a wrong view","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"123",1076,"had been taken of the matter, and that the time had arrived when it","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"2247",1076,"desirous of obliging, and informing them privately and apart","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2248",1076,"from business terms that the opportunity was one of exceptional","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2249",1076,"attractiveness, he placed the facts before them. After displaying a","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2250",1076,"number of diagrams bearing upon the mater, he proposed that they should","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2251",1076,"form an enterprise to be called ""The Ling (After Death) Without Much","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2252",1076,"Risk Assembly."" The manner of conducting this undertaking he explained","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2253",1076,"to be as follows: The body of Ling, whenever the spirit left it, should","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2254",1076,"become as theirs to be used for profit. For this benefit they would pay","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"2256",1076,"at, five thousand taels each year until the matter ended, and when that","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2257",1076,"period arrived another fifty thousand taels to persons depending upon","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"2263",1076,"who had entrusted money to his ventures, he proceeded to disclose the","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2264",1076,"advantages of such a system. At the extreme, he said, the amount which","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2265",1076,"they would be required to pay would be two hundred and fifty","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2266",1076,"thousand taels; but this was in reality a very misleading view of the","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2267",1076,"circumstance, as he would endeavour to show them. For one detail, he had","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2268",1076,"allotted to Ling thirty years of existence, which was the extreme amount","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"2273",1076,"contriving so ingenious a method of enriching himself, they might with","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2274",1076,"reasonable foresight rely upon his departing when half the period had","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2275",1076,"been attained; in that way seventy-five thousand taels would be restored","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2276",1076,"to them, for every year represented a saving of five thousand. Another","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2277",1076,"agreeable contemplation was that of the last sum, for by such a time","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2278",1076,"they would have arrived at the most pleasurable part of the enterprise:","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2279",1076,"a million taels' worth of pure gold would be displayed before them, and","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2280",1076,"the question of the final fifty thousand could be disposed of by cutting","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2281",1076,"off an arm or half a leg. Whether they adopted that course, or decided","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"2286",1076,"revealed as only fifty thousand taels in reality, a sum so despicably","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2287",1076,"insignificant that he had internal pains at mentioning it to so wealthy","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"2316",1076,"existence of and possibility of discovery of the wonderful gold fluid","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2317",1076,"were closely examined, and found to be in agreement, whereupon those","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2318",1076,"present made no further delay in admitting that the facts were indeed","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"2319",1076,"as they had been described, and indulged in a dignified stroking of","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"3748",1076,"so strengthened by the meat and herbs upon which he existed, that he","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"

"7172",1076,"accompany him; but having with difficulty succeeded in hiring a small","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
"7173",1076,"boat of inconsiderable value, he embarked with food, incense, and","The Wallet of Kai Lung","Bramah, Ernest","Fantasy","en"
