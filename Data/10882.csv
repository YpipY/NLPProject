"171",10882,"permission, we will for the present defer all consideration of the","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"173",10882,"","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"174",10882,"I have always esteemed Margaret the obvious, sensible, most","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"175",10882,"appropriate name that can be bestowed upon a girl-child, for it is a","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"178",10882,"","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"179",10882,"Yes, the first point I wish to make is that a woman-child, once","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"180",10882,"baptised Margaret, is thereby insured of a suitable name. Be she grave","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"181",10882,"or gay in after-life, wanton or pious or sullen, comely or otherwise,","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"183",10882,"taste for winter-gardens or the higher mathematics, whether she take","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"184",10882,"to golf or clinging organdies, the event is provided for. One has only","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"185",10882,"to consider for a moment, and if among a choice of Madge, Marjorie,","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"192",10882,"The second proof that this name must be the best of all possible names","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"193",10882,"is that Margaret Hugonin bore it. And so the murder is out. You may","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"194",10882,"suspect what you choose. I warn you in advance that I have no part","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"195",10882,"whatever in her story; and if my admiration for her given name appear","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"196",10882,"somewhat excessive, I can only protest that in this dissentient world","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"197",10882,"every one has a right to his own taste. I knew Margaret. I admired","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"198",10882,"her. And if in some unguarded moment I may have carried my admiration","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"199",10882,"to the point of indiscretion, her husband most assuredly knows all","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"200",10882,"about it, by this, and he and I are still the best of friends. So you","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"201",10882,"perceive that if I ever did so far forget myself it could scarcely","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"202",10882,"have amounted to a hanging matter.","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"203",10882,"","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"204",10882,"I am doubly sure that Margaret Hugonin was beautiful, for the reason","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"205",10882,"that I have never found a woman under forty-five who shared my","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"206",10882,"opinion. If you clap a Testament into my hand, I cannot affirm that","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"207",10882,"women are eager to recognise beauty in one another; at the utmost they","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"208",10882,"concede that this or that particular feature is well enough. But when","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"209",10882,"a woman is clean-eyed and straight-limbed, and has a cheery heart,","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"210",10882,"she really cannot help being beautiful; and when Nature accords her","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"211",10882,"a sufficiency of dimples and an infectious laugh, I protest she is","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"212",10882,"well-nigh irresistible. And all these Margaret Hugonin had.","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"213",10882,"","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"225",10882,"Imprimis, there was not very much of her--five feet three, at the","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"226",10882,"most; and hers was the well-groomed modern type that implies a","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"1019",10882,"became quite certain that there was, at least, one thing she might be","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"1088",10882,"in fine, any of the qualities a man might naturally look for in a","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"1103",10882,"woman is a pretty woman, and while she continue so no amount of","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1104",10882,"common-sense or experience will prevent a man, on provocation, from","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"1118",10882,"recorded--not very wise nor witty talk, if you will, but very pleasant","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1119",10882,"to make. There were many pauses. There was much laughter over nothing","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1120",10882,"in particular. There were any number of sentences ambitiously begun","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1121",10882,"that ended nowhere. Altogether, it was just the sort of talk for a man","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"1155",10882,"hair for luncheon and assured her image in the glass that she was a","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"1165",10882,"to be the result of consummate hypocrisy. In his laughter her keen ear","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1166",10882,"detected a hollow ring; and his courteous manner she found, at bottom,","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1167",10882,"mere servility. And finally she demonstrated--to her own satisfaction,","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1168",10882,"at least--that his charm of manner was of exactly the, same sort that","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"

"1192",10882,"tolerably well known. In fact, Margaret--prompted by Mrs. Haggage,","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1193",10882,"it must be confessed--had invited him to Selwoode for the especial","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1194",10882,"purpose of entertaining Miss Adele Haggage; for he was a good match,","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
"1195",10882,"and Mrs. Haggage, as an experienced chaperon, knew the value of","The Eagle's Shadow","Cabell, James Branch","Fantasy","en"
