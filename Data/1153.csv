"1438",1153,"under similar circumstances she would again be equally as craven. It","The Chessmen of Mars","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"1450",1153,"party nearest her, both men and women, and all were beautiful of form","The Chessmen of Mars","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
