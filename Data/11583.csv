"109",11583,"A most remarkable invention is weaving the world together in a way we ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"110",11583,"never anticipated while you were on Earth, and it netted your writing. ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"112",11583,"connect to each other, share their enthusiasm for your novels, and were ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"113",11583,"inspired to continue the voyage. Led by Jonathan Cooper, the intrepid ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"114",11583,"mastermind of the creative crew, they made a commitment to write their ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"118",11583,"internet. There seems no need to explain what it is here, but part of ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"121",11583,"","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"123",11583,"in that they functioned independently of time and space, only much more ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"124",11583,"slowly. You presented your ideas in books as ideas are posted on the ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"128",11583,"in your stories and tried to get the publisher to renew the series. ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"129",11583,"Sadly, your old publisher ignored them and blocked the revival, as ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"134",11583,"young men of the stars prove that they too are brave, adventurous and ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"135",11583,"willing to sacrifice for freedom and justice.  With a loyalty toward ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"138",11583,"and we along with them, learn whether they measure up. Will they prove ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"214",11583,"and their companion Steve Cliff, had followed less than fifteen minutes ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"215",11583,"later. The brief lead that Lurton Zimbardo's ship had was enough to ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"216",11583,"keep the Silver Spear out of the clutches of their pursuers, but not by ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"217",11583,"much. The crew of the Spear was suffering acutely from sleeplessness ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"219",11583,"","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"220",11583,"Only days earlier, Lurton Zimbardo had been second-in-command under ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"221",11583,"Troy Putnam. Together they had organized over 500 men and attempted to ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"222",11583,"take control of the capital city of Mars in a sudden attack. Had they ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"223",11583,"succeeded, the pirates could have held the people of the Earth-Moon ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"224",11583,"system hostage to their demands. The Starmen and their allies had ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"225",11583,"thwarted the pirates' plan. Most of the pirates, including their ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"226",11583,"leader, had been captured. Zimbardo, however, had escaped with a few ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"227",11583,"others. With the Starmen in close pursuit, he was desperately trying to ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"228",11583,"outrun them and return to the pirates' base in the Asteroid Belt. ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"229",11583,"","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"230",11583,"The Belt loomed up. The first few chunks of rock were visible now to ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"231",11583,"the unaided eyes of those on the deck of the Silver Spear. In seconds, ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"236",11583,"navigator's eyes were the size of saucers. Immobile with terror, he ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"237",11583,"didn't respond to Zimbardo's command. The former second-in-command of ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"238",11583,"the pirates pushed him out of the chair, took over, and activated the ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"239",11583,"switch that cut in the automatic pilot. Lurton Zimbardo was not ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"240",11583,"physically imposing, but more than made up for his slight build with an ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"241",11583,"immensely strong will and a decisive nature that was merciless whenever ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"2750",11583,"another at a small table on the far side of the corridor. The one on ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"2752",11583,"over 200 pounds; the other was blond, of medium build. He was leaning ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
"2753",11583,"on his elbow, pondering his next move in a board game. When the door ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"2756",11583,"Both the Starmen and the pirates froze for a split second, then both ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"2762",11583,"the big pirate took two table legs on his left thigh and upper chest. ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"

"2809",11583,"Almost instantly, it seemed, the door opened. The only light came from ","The Runaway Asteroid","Cooper, Michael D.","Science Fiction","en"
