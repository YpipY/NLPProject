"29",1268,"intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"31",1268,"hundred miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"32",1268,"thirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel. Towns were","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"34",1268,"water which were precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"37",1268,"thousand people crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"42",1268,"But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"43",1268,"drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"44",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"45",1268,"In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"46",1268,"waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"47",1268,"air and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"48",1268,"round and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"49",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"50",1268,"Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"52",1268,"with spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"53",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"54",1268,"Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"55",1268,"what part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"56",1268,"during the storm. But the storm had raged five days already, and the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"57",1268,"first symptoms were manifested on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"58",1268,"the balloon came from a great distance, for it could not have traveled","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"59",1268,"less than two thousand miles in twenty-four hours.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"60",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"61",1268,"At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"62",1268,"could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"63",1268,"since their departure. It was a remarkable fact that, although in the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"64",1268,"very midst of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it. They","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"65",1268,"were thrown about and whirled round and round without feeling the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"66",1268,"rotation in the slightest degree, or being sensible that they were","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"67",1268,"removed from a horizontal position.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"68",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"69",1268,"Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"70",1268,"beneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"71",1268,"of the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"72",1268,"night. No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"73",1268,"of the ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"74",1268,"suspended in those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone had","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"75",1268,"informed them of the dangers which they ran from the waves. However,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"76",1268,"the balloon, lightened of heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"77",1268,"provisions, had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"78",1268,"height of 4,500 feet. The voyagers, after having discovered that the sea","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"79",1268,"extended beneath them, and thinking the dangers above less dreadful than","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"80",1268,"those below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"81",1268,"articles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"82",1268,"of their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"83",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"84",1268,"The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"85",1268,"less energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"86",1268,"began to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"87",1268,"it showed symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"88",1268,"risen into the more lofty regions of the air. In a few hours the wind","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"89",1268,"had changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"90",1268,"of the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half. It","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"91",1268,"was still what sailors call ""a close-reefed topsail breeze,"" but the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"92",1268,"commotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"93",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"94",1268,"Towards eleven o'clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"95",1268,"clearer. The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"96",1268,"after the passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"97",1268,"farther to the west. It appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"98",1268,"passed away in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"100",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"101",1268,"But at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"102",1268,"slowly descending with a regular movement. It appeared as if it were,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"103",1268,"little by little, collapsing, and that its case was lengthening and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"104",1268,"extending, passing from a spherical to an oval form. Towards midday the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"105",1268,"balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet. It","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"106",1268,"contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity, it","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"107",1268,"could maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"108",1268,"great altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"109",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"110",1268,"Perceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"111",1268,"which still weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"112",1268,"everything, even to their pocket-knives, and one of them, having hoisted","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"113",1268,"himself on to the circles which united the cords of the net, tried to","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"114",1268,"secure more firmly the lower point of the balloon.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"115",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"116",1268,"It was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"117",1268,"that the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"118",1268,"They must infallibly perish!","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"119",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"120",1268,"There was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"121",1268,"The watery expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"122",1268,"surface upon which their anchor could hold.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"123",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"124",1268,"It was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"125",1268,"violence! It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"126",1268,"whose gaze, from their commanding position, extended over a radius of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"127",1268,"forty miles. The vast liquid plain, lashed without mercy by the storm,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"128",1268,"appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers, whose white and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"129",1268,"disheveled crests were streaming in the wind. No land was in sight, not","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"130",1268,"a solitary ship could be seen. It was necessary at any cost to arrest","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"131",1268,"their downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"132",1268,"the waves. The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"133",1268,"But, notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"134",1268,"same time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the direction of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"135",1268,"the wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the southwest.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"136",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"137",1268,"Frightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men. They were","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"138",1268,"evidently no longer masters of the machine. All their attempts were","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"139",1268,"useless. The case of the balloon collapsed more and more. The gas","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"140",1268,"escaped without any possibility of retaining it. Their descent was","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"141",1268,"visibly accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within 600 feet","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"142",1268,"of the ocean.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"143",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"144",1268,"It was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"145",1268,"large rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the articles which","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"146",1268,"it contained, the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"147",1268,"in the air for a few hours. But the inevitable catastrophe could only","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"148",1268,"be retarded, and if land did not appear before night, voyagers, car, and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"149",1268,"balloon must to a certainty vanish beneath the waves.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"150",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"151",1268,"They now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were truly","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"152",1268,"dauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a single","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"153",1268,"murmur escaped from their lips. They were determined to struggle to the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"154",1268,"last minute, to do anything to retard their fall. The car was only a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"155",1268,"sort of willow basket, unable to float, and there was not the slightest","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"156",1268,"possibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"157",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"158",1268,"Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"160",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"161",1268,"At that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"162",1268,"inaccessible to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"163",1268,"less determined. ""Is everything thrown out?"" ""No, here are still 2,000","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"168",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"169",1268,"This was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"170",1268,"The ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"171",1268,"mounted 2,000 feet. The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"172",1268,"net, and clung to the meshes, gazing at the abyss.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"173",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"174",1268,"The delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is sufficient to","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"175",1268,"throw out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"176",1268,"position. The apparatus in the air is like a balance of mathematical","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"177",1268,"precision. It can be thus easily understood that when it is lightened of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"178",1268,"any considerable weight its movement will be impetuous and sudden. So","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"179",1268,"it happened on this occasion. But after being suspended for an instant","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"180",1268,"aloft, the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"199",1268,"be reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"435",1268,"of age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"436",1268,"bright sparkling eyes and a remarkably good physiognomy. Pencroft was an","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"437",1268,"American from the North, who had sailed all the ocean over, and who had","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"438",1268,"gone through every possible and almost impossible adventure that a being","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"440",1268,"he was a bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"442",1268,"on business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1052",1268,"the sailor and the lad placed some good-sized pieces of wood, which","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1054",1268,"which they stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1055",1268,"loaded at least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1074",1268,"which a man might possibly cling, yet existed. Nothing! The sea was but","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1075",1268,"one vast watery desert. As to the coast, it was solitary also. Neither","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1098",1268,"banks of sand, which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1099",1268,"returned towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1524",1268,"However, according to Pencroft's advice, it appeared best to wait a few","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1539",1268,"Chimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1540",1268,"the shore or into the interior of the country. This plan suited Neb","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1541",1268,"particularly. As obstinate in his ideas as in his presentiments, he","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1542",1268,"was in no haste to abandon this part of the coast, the scene of the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1548",1268,"touched with his hands the corpse of his master, he would not believe","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1549",1268,"in his death! And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1550",1268,"determined heart. An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1551",1268,"respected, and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy. As for him,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1552",1268,"he hoped no longer, but there was no use in arguing with Neb. He was","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1553",1268,"like the dog who will not leave the place where his master is buried,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1582",1268,"Notwithstanding, the thing was well worth while trying, and a part of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1583",1268,"Pencroft's large checked handkerchief was soon reduced to the state of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1588",1268,"It was nine o'clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1589",1268,"breeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1590",1268,"the Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1591",1268,"that place, curled round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1593",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1594",1268,"Arrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1595",1268,"branches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1596",1268,"rubbed smooth on a rock. Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1599",1268,"From the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1600",1268,"narrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks, over","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1601",1268,"which the trees formed a double arch. Pencroft, lest they should lose","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1602",1268,"themselves, resolved to follow the course of the stream, which would","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1603",1268,"always lead them back to the point from which they started. But the bank","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1604",1268,"was not without some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the trees","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1605",1268,"bent level with the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1606",1268,"to break down with their sticks. Herbert often glided among the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1607",1268,"broken stumps with the agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1608",1268,"underwood. But Pencroft called him back directly, begging him not to","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1609",1268,"wander away. Meanwhile, the sailor attentively observed the disposition","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1610",1268,"and nature of the surrounding country. On the left bank, the ground,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1611",1268,"which was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior. It","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1612",1268,"looked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless reached","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1613",1268,"the river by some underground drain. Sometimes a stream ran through the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1614",1268,"underwood, which they crossed without difficulty. The opposite shore","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1615",1268,"appeared to be more uneven, and the valley of which the river occupied","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1616",1268,"the bottom was more clearly visible. The hill, covered with trees","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1617",1268,"disposed in terraces, intercepted the view. On the right bank walking","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1618",1268,"would have been difficult, for the declivities fell suddenly, and the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1619",1268,"trees bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1620",1268,"their roots.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1621",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1622",1268,"It is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1623",1268,"surveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft only saw","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1624",1268,"traces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1625",1268,"recognize the species. In all probability, and such was also Herbert's","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1626",1268,"opinion, some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1627",1268,"would give them some trouble; but nowhere did they observe the mark of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1628",1268,"an axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1629",1268,"human foot. On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1630",1268,"any land in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1631",1268,"more to be feared than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1632",1268,"for the difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1633",1268,"after walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1634",1268,"As yet the hunt had not been successful. However, some birds sang","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1635",1268,"and fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1636",1268,"inspired them with an instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert described,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1637",1268,"in a marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1638",1268,"resembling the king-fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1639",1268,"metallic brilliancy.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1640",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1641",1268,"""That must be a jacamar,"" said Herbert, trying to get nearer.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1652",1268,"""No, no, my boy!"" replied the sailor. ""The blow was well aimed; many a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1713",1268,"juniper-tree among others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1714",1268,"through the forest. This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1716",1268,"whose plumage was rich chestnut-brown mottled with dark brown, and tail","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1717",1268,"of the same color. Herbert recognized the males by the two wing-like","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1720",1268,"flesh is better than that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1722",1268,"attempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1723",1268,"said to the lad,--","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1729",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1730",1268,"""Like a fish,"" replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had found","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1731",1268,"among the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1732",1268,"eggs. He took great care not to touch these nests, to which their","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1733",1268,"proprietors would not fail to return. It was around these that he","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1734",1268,"meant to stretch his lines, not snares, but real fishing-lines. He took","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1735",1268,"Herbert to some distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1736",1268,"apparatus with all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1737",1268,"have used. Herbert watched the work with great interest, though rather","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1738",1268,"doubting its success. The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1739",1268,"one to the other, of the length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1740",1268,"thorns, the points bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1744",1268,"This done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1767",1268,"jerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"2595",1268,"which he gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only washed by the sea","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5101",1268,"The coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5860",1268,"habit he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed look, he","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5866",1268,"The nitro-glycerine had indeed acted powerfully. The opening which it","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5867",1268,"had made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5868",1268,"this new outlet was at least treble that which before passed through the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5869",1268,"old one. The result was, that a short time after the operation the level","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5887",1268,"""No, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would be easy","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5897",1268,"The settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went immediately","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5898",1268,"towards that point of the lake near which was the old opening now","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5899",1268,"uncovered. This outlet had now become practicable, since the water no","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5902",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5903",1268,"In a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5904",1268,"and a glance showed them that the object had been attained.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5905",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5906",1268,"In fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5907",1268,"water, appeared the long-looked-for opening. A narrow ridge, left bare","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5908",1268,"by the retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it. This orifice","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5909",1268,"was nearly twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in height. It was like","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5910",1268,"the mouth of a drain at the edge of the pavement, and therefore did","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5911",1268,"not offer an easy passage to the settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5912",1268,"their pickaxes, soon made it of a suitable height.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5913",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5914",1268,"The engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the opening,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5915",1268,"in its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than from thirty to","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5916",1268,"thirty-five degrees. It was therefore practicable, and, provided that","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5917",1268,"the declivity did not increase, it would be easy to descend even to the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5918",1268,"level of the sea. If then, as was probable, some vast cavity existed in","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5919",1268,"the interior of the granite, it might, perhaps, be of great use.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5921",1268,"""Well, captain, what are we stopping for?"" asked the sailor, impatient","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5923",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5924",1268,"""Very well,"" replied the engineer. ""But we must see our way. Neb, go and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5927",1268,"Neb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines and other","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5928",1268,"green trees, and soon returned with some branches, which they made","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5929",1268,"into torches. The torches were lighted with flint and steel, and Cyrus","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5930",1268,"Harding leading, the settlers ventured into the dark passage, which the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5932",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5933",1268,"Contrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the passage","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5934",1268,"increased as the explorers proceeded, so that they very soon were able","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5935",1268,"to stand upright. The granite, worn by the water for an infinite time,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5936",1268,"was very slippery, and falls were to be dreaded. But the settlers were","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5937",1268,"all attached to each other by a cord, as is frequently done in ascending","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5938",1268,"mountains. Happily some projections of the granite, forming regular","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5939",1268,"steps, made the descent less perilous. Drops, still hanging from the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5940",1268,"rocks, shone here and there under the light of the torches, and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5941",1268,"the explorers guessed that the sides were clothed with innumerable","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5942",1268,"stalactites. The engineer examined this black granite. There was not a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5943",1268,"stratum, not a break in it. The mass was compact, and of an extremely","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5944",1268,"close grain. The passage dated, then, from the very origin of the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5945",1268,"island. It was not the water which little by little had hollowed it.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5946",1268,"Pluto and not Neptune had bored it with his own hand, and on the wall","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5947",1268,"traces of an eruptive work could be distinguished, which all the washing","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5949",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5950",1268,"The settlers descended very slowly. They could not but feel a certain","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5951",1268,"awe, in this venturing into these unknown depths, for the first time","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5952",1268,"visited by human beings. They did not speak, but they thought; and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5953",1268,"the thought came to more than one, that some polypus or other","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5954",1268,"gigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities, which were in","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5955",1268,"communication with the sea. However, Top kept at the head of the little","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5960",1268,"Harding who was walking on before, stopped, and his companions came up","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5961",1268,"with him. The place where they had halted was wider, so as to form a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5963",1268,"that did not prove that they oozed through the rock. They were simply","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6281",1268,"plan proposed by Cyrus Harding, the space was to be divided into five","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6282",1268,"compartments looking out on the sea; to the right, an entry with a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6283",1268,"door, which would meet the ladder; then a kitchen, thirty feet long; a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6284",1268,"dining-room, measuring forty feet; a sleeping-room, of equal size; and","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6285",1268,"lastly, a ""Visitor's room,"" petitioned for by Pencroft, and which was","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6286",1268,"next to the great hall. These rooms, or rather this suite of rooms,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6287",1268,"would not occupy all the depth of the cave. There would be also a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6288",1268,"corridor and a storehouse, in which their tools, provisions, and stores","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6289",1268,"would be kept. All the productions of the island, the flora as well as","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6290",1268,"the fauna, were to be there in the best possible state of preservation,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6291",1268,"and completely sheltered from the damp. There was no want of space, so","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6292",1268,"that each object could be methodically arranged. Besides, the colonists","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6293",1268,"had still at their disposal the little grotto above the great cavern,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6294",1268,"which was like the garret of the new dwelling.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6295",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6296",1268,"This plan settled, it had only to be put into execution. The miners","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6297",1268,"became brickmakers again, then the bricks were brought to the foot of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6298",1268,"Granite House. Till then, Harding and his companions had only entered","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6299",1268,"the cavern by the long passage. This mode of communication obliged them","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6300",1268,"first to climb Prospect Heights, making a detour by the river's bank,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6301",1268,"and then to descend two hundred feet through the passage, having to","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6302",1268,"climb as far when they wished to return to the plateau. This was a great","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6303",1268,"loss of time, and was also very fatiguing. Cyrus Harding, therefore,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6304",1268,"resolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6305",1268,"a strong rope ladder, which, once raised, would render Granite House","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6310",1268,"cable. As to the rounds, they were made of a sort of red cedar, with","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6311",1268,"light, strong branches; and this apparatus was wrought by the masterly","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6314",1268,"Other ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane with a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6320",1268,"roughly at first, and in a short time, the cave was divided into rooms","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6403",1268,"immense woods, to which the name of the Forests of the Far West had been","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16028",1268,"His plan was bold, but it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16029",1268,"night. Once arrived at the vessel's side, Ayrton, holding on to the main","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16030",1268,"chains, might reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16032",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16033",1268,"Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16035",1268,"less from the temperature of the water, which was still cold. He might,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16036",1268,"indeed, be obliged to remain in it for several hours.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16037",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16040",1268,"they returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was thrown over his","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16041",1268,"shoulders, and the settlers all came round him to press his hand.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16042",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16043",1268,"Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16045",1268,"It was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16047",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16048",1268,"The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16049",1268,"shore of the islet. This was not done without precaution, for fear lest","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16050",1268,"the pirates might be roaming about there. But after a careful survey,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16051",1268,"it was evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton then, followed by","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16052",1268,"Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16053",1268,"holes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16054",1268,"and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16055",1268,"had recently appeared, showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16056",1268,"he crouched down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16061",1268,"head just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16062",1268,"the brig, from which the lights were reflected in the water. He thought","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16063",1268,"only of the duty which he had promised to accomplish, and nothing of the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16064",1268,"danger which he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea, often","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16065",1268,"frequented by sharks. The current bore him along and he rapidly receded","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16069",1268,"heard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains. He took","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16070",1268,"breath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16071",1268,"the cutwater. There were drying several pairs of sailors' trousers. He","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16072",1268,"put on a pair. Then settling himself firmly, he listened. They were not","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16073",1268,"sleeping on board the brig. On the contrary, they were talking, singing,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16074",1268,"laughing. And these were the sentences, accompanied with oaths, which","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16075",1268,"principally struck Ayrton:--","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16139",1268,"increased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16151",1268,"unworthy of pity, and against whom any means would be right. So thought","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16164",1268,"cutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle. Then, gliding","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16165",1268,"among the convicts stretched here and there, he made the round of the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16166",1268,"ship, and found that the ""Speedy"" carried four guns, which would throw","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16167",1268,"shot of from eight to ten pounds in weight. He found also, on touching","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16168",1268,"them that these guns were breech-loaders. They were therefore, of modern","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16170",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16171",1268,"As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16173",1268,"listening to them, Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16181",1268,"and he prepared to regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16183",1268,"said, to do more than his duty, there came an heroic thought. This was","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16184",1268,"to sacrifice his own life, but save the island and the colonists. Cyrus","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16185",1268,"Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16186",1268,"either by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16187",1268,"out the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16188",1268,"thought of his preservers--those who had made him again a man, and an","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16189",1268,"honest mm, those to whom he owed all--murdered without pity, their works","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16190",1268,"destroyed, their island turned into a pirates' den! He said to himself","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16191",1268,"that he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many disasters, since his","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16192",1268,"old companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized his own plans, and a","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16193",1268,"feeling of horror took possession of him. Then he was seized with an","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16194",1268,"irresistible desire to blow up the brig and with her, all whom she had","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16197",1268,"","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16199",1268,"situated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy. There would be no want","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16200",1268,"of powder in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16203",1268,"Ayrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with numerous","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16204",1268,"sleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A lantern was lighted","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"16205",1268,"at the foot of the mainmast, round which was hung a gun-rack, furnished","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"16210",1268,"destruction. He then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"17045",1268,"It was probable that they would find a little of everything, and they","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"17053",1268,"Partitions and stanchions were smashed, as if some tremendous shell had","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"17056",1268,"were not heavy bales, which would have been difficult to remove,","The Mysterious Island","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
