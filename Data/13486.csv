"62",13486,"another. Among these many forms of art there are two of principal","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"63",13486,"importance. One of the two is the art which is concerned with the","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"64",13486,"making and adorning of the houses in which men and women live; that is","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"70",13486,"with the making and adorning of stories in prose and verse. Both of","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"71",13486,"these kinds of art were practised by Morris throughout his life. The","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"72",13486,"former was his principal occupation; he made his living by it, and","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"75",13486,"life in England and in other countries also. His profession was thus","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"76",13486,"that of a manufacturer, designer, and decorator. When he had to","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"77",13486,"describe himself by a single word, he called himself a designer. But","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"78",13486,"it is the latter branch of his art which principally concerns us now,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"79",13486,"the art of a maker and adorner of stories. He became famous in this","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"80",13486,"kind of art also, both in prose and verse, as a romance-writer and a","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"81",13486,"poet. But he spoke of it as play rather than work, and although he","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"82",13486,"spent much time and great pains on it, he regarded it as relaxation","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"124",13486,"Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs."" In that poem he retold a story","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"125",13486,"of which an Icelandic version, the ""Volsunga Saga,"" written in the","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"129",13486,"chief epic of the Roman Empire. Morris's love for these great stories","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"130",13486,"of ancient times led him to rewrite the tale of the Volsungs and","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"131",13486,"Niblungs, which he reckoned the finest of them all, more fully and on","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"134",13486,"in 1886-87, he also made a verse translation of the ""Odyssey."" In 1873","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"135",13486,"he had also written another very beautiful poem, ""Love is Enough,""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"140",13486,"To write prose was at first for Morris more difficult than to write","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"141",13486,"poetry. Verse came naturally to him, and he composed in prose only","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"142",13486,"with much effort until after long practice. Except for his early tales","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"143",13486,"in the Oxford and Cambridge Magazine and his translations of Icelandic","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"145",13486,"he began to give lectures and addresses, and wrote them in great","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"146",13486,"numbers during the latter part of his life. A number of them were","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"403",13486,"  There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen old;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"404",13486,"  Dukes were the door-wards there, and the roofs were thatched with gold:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"405",13486,"  Earls were the wrights that wrought it, and silver nailed its doors;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"406",13486,"  Earls' wives were the weaving-women, queens' daughters strewed its floors,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"407",13486,"  And the masters of its song-craft were the mightiest men that cast","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"408",13486,"  The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blast.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"409",13486,"  There dwelt men merry-hearted, and in hope exceeding great","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"410",13486,"  Met the good days and the evil as they went the way of fate:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"411",13486,"  There the Gods were unforgotten, yea whiles they walked with men,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"412",13486,"  Though e'en in that world's beginning rose a murmur now and again","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"413",13486,"  Of the midward time and the fading and the last of the latter days,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"414",13486,"  And the entering in of the terror, and the death of the People's Praise.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"415",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"416",13486,"  Thus was the dwelling of Volsung, the King of the Midworld's Mark,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"417",13486,"  As a rose in the winter season, a candle in the dark;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"418",13486,"  And as in all other matters 'twas all earthly houses' crown,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"419",13486,"  And the least of its wall-hung shields was a battle-world's renown,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"420",13486,"  So therein withal was a marvel and a glorious thing to see,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"421",13486,"  For amidst of its midmost hall-floor sprang up a mighty tree,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"422",13486,"  That reared its blessings roofward, and wreathed the roof-tree dear","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"423",13486,"  With the glory of the summer and the garland of the year.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"424",13486,"  I know not how they called it ere Volsung changed his life,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"425",13486,"  But his dawning of fair promise, and his noontide of the strife,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"426",13486,"  His eve of the battle-reaping and the garnering of his fame,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"427",13486,"  Have bred us many a story and named us many a name;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"428",13486,"  And when men tell of Volsung, they call that war-duke's tree,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"429",13486,"  That crowned stem, the Branstock; and so was it told unto me.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"430",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"431",13486,"  So there was the throne of Volsung beneath its blossoming bower,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"432",13486,"  But high o'er the roof-crest red it rose 'twixt tower and tower,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"433",13486,"  And therein were the wild hawks dwelling, abiding the dole of their lord;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"434",13486,"  And they wailed high over the wine, and laughed to the waking sword.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"435",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"436",13486,"  Still were its boughs but for them, when lo, on an even of May","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"437",13486,"  Comes a man from Siggeir the King with a word for his mouth to say:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"438",13486,"  ""All hail to thee King Volsung, from the King of the Goths I come:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"439",13486,"  He hath heard of thy sword victorious and thine abundant home;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"440",13486,"  He hath heard of thy sons in the battle, the fillers of Odin's Hall;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"441",13486,"  And a word hath the west-wind blown him, (full fruitful be its fall!)","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"442",13486,"  A word of thy daughter Signy the crown of womanhood:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"443",13486,"  Now he deems thy friendship goodly, and thine help in the battle good,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"444",13486,"  And for these will he give his friendship and his battle-aid again:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"445",13486,"  But if thou wouldst grant his asking, and make his heart full fain,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"446",13486,"  Then shalt thou give him a matter, saith he, without a price,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"447",13486,"  --Signy the fairer than fair, Signy the wiser than wise.""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"448",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"449",13486,"Now the message gladdened Volsung and his sons, but no word spake","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"450",13486,"Signy, till the king asked her what her mind might be. Then said","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"451",13486,"Signy, ""I will wed the Goth king, and yet shall I rue my lot in his","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"452",13486,"hall."" And Volsung urged her with kind words to do nought against her","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"453",13486,"will, but her mind was fixed, and she said she wrought but what the","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"454",13486,"gods had fore-ordained. So the earl of Siggeir went his way with","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"455",13486,"gifts and fair words, bidding the Goth king come ere a month was over","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"456",13486,"to wed the white-handed Signy and bear her home.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"457",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"458",13486,"  So on Mid-Summer Even ere the undark night began","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"459",13486,"  Siggeir the King of the Goth-folk went up from the bath of the swan","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"460",13486,"  Unto the Volsung dwelling with many an Earl about;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"461",13486,"  There through the glimmering thicket the linked mail rang out,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"462",13486,"  And sang as mid the woodways sings the summer-hidden ford:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"463",13486,"  There were gold-rings God-fashioned, and many a Dwarf-wrought sword,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"464",13486,"  And many a Queen-wrought kirtle and many a written spear;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"465",13486,"  So came they to the acres, and drew the threshold near,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"466",13486,"  And amidst of the garden blossoms, on the grassy, fruit-grown land,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"467",13486,"  Was Volsung the King of the Wood-world with his sons on either hand;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"468",13486,"  Therewith down lighted Siggeir the lord of a mighty folk,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"469",13486,"  Yet showed he by King Volsung as the bramble by the oak,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"470",13486,"  Nor reached his helm to the shoulder of the least of Volsung's sons.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"471",13486,"  And so into the hall they wended, the Kings and their mighty ones;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"472",13486,"  And they dight the feast full glorious, and drank through the death of the","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"473",13486,"       day,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"474",13486,"  Till the shadowless moon rose upward, till it wended white away;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"475",13486,"  Then they went to the gold-hung beds, and at last for an hour or twain","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"476",13486,"  Were all things still and silent, save a flaw of the summer rain.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"477",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"478",13486,"  But on the morrow noontide when the sun was high and bare,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"479",13486,"  More glorious was the banquet, and now was Signy there,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"480",13486,"  And she sat beside King Siggeir, a glorious bride forsooth;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"481",13486,"  Ruddy and white was she wrought as the fair-stained sea-beast's tooth,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"482",13486,"  But she neither laughed nor spake, and her eyes were hard and cold,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"483",13486,"  And with wandering side-long looks her lord would she behold.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"484",13486,"  That saw Sigmund her brother, the eldest Volsung son,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"485",13486,"  And oft he looked upon her, and their eyes met now and anon,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"486",13486,"  And ruth arose in his heart, and hate of Siggeir the Goth,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"487",13486,"  And there had he broken the wedding, but for plighted promise and troth.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"488",13486,"  But those twain were beheld of Siggeir, and he deemed of the Volsung kin,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"489",13486,"  That amid their might and their malice small honour should he win;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"490",13486,"  Yet thereof made he no semblance, but abided times to be,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"491",13486,"  And laughed out with the loudest, amid the hope and the glee.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"492",13486,"  And nought of all saw Volsung, as he dreamed of the coming glory,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"493",13486,"  And how the Kings of his kindred should fashion the round world's story.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"494",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"495",13486,"  So round about the Branstock they feast in the gleam of the gold;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"496",13486,"  And though the deeds of man-folk were not yet waxen old,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"497",13486,"  Yet had they tales for songcraft, and the blossomed garth of rhyme;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"498",13486,"  Tales of the framing of all things and the entering in of time","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"499",13486,"  From the halls of the outer heaven; so near they knew the door.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"500",13486,"  Wherefore uprose a sea-king, and his hands that loved the oar","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"501",13486,"  Now dealt with the rippling harp-gold, and he sang of the shaping of earth,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"502",13486,"  And how the stars were lighted, and where the winds had birth,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"503",13486,"  And the gleam of the first of summers on the yet untrodden grass.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"504",13486,"  But e'en as men's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder pass","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"505",13486,"  O'er the cloudless noontide heaven; and some men turned about","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"506",13486,"  And deemed that in the doorway they heard a man laugh out.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"507",13486,"  Then into the Volsung dwelling a mighty man there strode,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"508",13486,"  One-eyed and seeming ancient, yet bright his visage glowed:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"509",13486,"  Cloud-blue was the hood upon him, and his kirtle gleaming-grey","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"510",13486,"  As the latter morning sundog when the storm is on the way:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"511",13486,"  A bill he bore on his shoulder, whose mighty ashen beam","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"512",13486,"  Burnt bright with the flame of the sea and the blended silver's gleam.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"513",13486,"  And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"514",13486,"  Was borne by their fathers' fathers, and the first that warred in the wold.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"515",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"516",13486,"  So strode he to the Branstock nor greeted any lord,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"517",13486,"  But forth from his cloudy raiment he drew a gleaming sword,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"518",13486,"  And smote it deep in the tree-hole, and the wild hawks overhead","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"519",13486,"  Laughed 'neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"520",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"521",13486,"  ""Earls of the Goths, and Volsungs, abiders on the earth,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"522",13486,"  Lo there amid the Branstock a blade of plenteous worth!","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"523",13486,"  The folk of the war-wand's forgers wrought never better steel","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"524",13486,"  Since first the burg of heaven uprose for man-folk's weal.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"525",13486,"  Now let the man among you whose heart and hand may shift","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"526",13486,"  To pluck it from the oakwood e'en take it for my gift.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"527",13486,"  Then ne'er, but his own heart falter, its point and edge shall fail","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"528",13486,"  Until the night's beginning and the ending of the tale.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"529",13486,"  Be merry Earls of the Goth-folk, O Volsung Sons be wise","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"530",13486,"  And reap the battle-acre that ripening for you lies:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"531",13486,"  For they told me in the wild wood, I heard on the mountain side,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"532",13486,"  That the shining house of heaven is wrought exceeding wide,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"533",13486,"  And that there the Early-comers shall have abundant rest","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"534",13486,"  While Earth grows scant of great ones, and fadeth from its best,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"535",13486,"  And fadeth from its midward and groweth poor and vile:--","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"536",13486,"  All hail to thee King Volsung! farewell for a little while!""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"537",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"538",13486,"  So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"539",13486,"  That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"540",13486,"  We stir not lest we waken; but there his speech had end,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"541",13486,"  And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"542",13486,"  And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"543",13486,"  For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to praise.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"544",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"545",13486,"  But now spake Volsung the King: ""Why sit ye silent and still?","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"546",13486,"  Is the Battle-Father's visage a token of terror and ill?","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"547",13486,"  Arise O Volsung Children, Earls of the Goths arise,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"548",13486,"  And set your hands to the hilts as mighty men and wise!","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"549",13486,"  Yet deem it not too easy; for belike a fateful blade","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"550",13486,"  Lies there in the heart of the Branstock for a fated warrior made.""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"551",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"552",13486,"  Now therewith spake King Siggeir: ""King Volsung give me a grace","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"553",13486,"  To try it the first of all men, lest another win my place","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"554",13486,"  And mere chance-hap steal my glory and the gain that I might win.""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"555",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"556",13486,"  Then somewhat laughed King Volsung, and he said: ""O Guest, begin;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"557",13486,"  Though herein is the first as the last, for the Gods have long to live,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"559",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"560",13486,"  Then forth to the tree went Siggeir, the Goth-folk's mighty lord,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"561",13486,"  And laid his hand on the gemstones, and strained at the glorious sword","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"562",13486,"  Till his heart grew black with anger; and never a word he said","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"563",13486,"  As he wended back to the high-seat: but Signy waxed blood-red","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"564",13486,"  When he sat him adown beside her; and her heart was nigh to break","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"565",13486,"  For the shame and the fateful boding: and therewith King Volsung spake:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"566",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"567",13486,"  ""Thus comes back empty-handed the mightiest King of Earth,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"569",13486,"  And today may a great beginning from a little seed upspring","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"570",13486,"  To o'erpass many a great one that hath the name of King:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"573",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"575",13486,"  And deemed his time was coming for a glorious gain and high;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"577",13486,"  No looser in the Branstock that gift of Odin stood.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"578",13486,"  Then uprose Volsung's homemen, and the fell-abiding folk;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"579",13486,"  And the yellow-headed shepherds came gathering round the Oak,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"580",13486,"  And the searchers of the thicket and the dealers with the oar:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"581",13486,"  And the least and the worst of them all was a mighty man of war.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"582",13486,"  But for all their mighty shaping, and the struggle and the strain","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"583",13486,"  Of their hands, the deft in labour, they tugged thereat in vain;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"584",13486,"  And still as the shouting and jeers, and the names of men and the laughter","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"585",13486,"  Beat backward from gable to gable, and rattled o'er roof-tree and rafter,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"586",13486,"  Moody and still sat Siggeir; for he said: ""They have trained me here","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"588",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"589",13486,"  Now the tumult sank a little, and men cried on Volsung the King","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"590",13486,"  And his sons, the hedge of battle, to try the fateful thing.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"591",13486,"  So Volsung laughed, and answered: ""I will set me to the toil,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"592",13486,"  Lest these my guests of the Goth-folk should deem I fear the foil.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"593",13486,"  Yet nought am I ill-sworded, and the oldest friend is best;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"597",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"598",13486,"  Therewith from his belt of battle he raised the golden sheath,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"599",13486,"  And showed the peace-strings glittering about the hidden death:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"600",13486,"  Then he laid his hand on the Branstock, and cried: ""O tree beloved,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"601",13486,"  I thank thee of thy good-heart that so little thou art moved:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"604",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"605",13486,"  Then as a young man laughed he, and on the hilts of gold","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"606",13486,"  His hand, the battle-breaker, took fast and certain hold,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"607",13486,"  And long he drew and strained him, but mended not the tale,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"608",13486,"  Yet none the more thereover his mirth of heart did fail;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"609",13486,"  But he wended to the high-seat and thence began to cry:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"610",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"611",13486,"  ""Sons I have gotten and cherished, now stand ye forth to try;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"612",13486,"  Lest Odin tell in God-home how from the way he strayed,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"613",13486,"  And how to the man he would not he gave away his blade.""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"614",13486,"  So therewithal rose Rerir, and wasted might and main;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"615",13486,"  Then Gunthiof, and then Hunthiof, they wearied them in vain;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"616",13486,"  Nought was the might of Agnar; nought Helgi could avail;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"617",13486,"  Sigi the tall and Solar no further brought the tale,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"619",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"620",13486,"  At last by the side of the Branstock Sigmund the Volsung stood,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"621",13486,"  And with right hand wise in battle the precious sword-hilt caught,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"622",13486,"  Yet in a careless fashion, as he deemed it all for nought:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"623",13486,"  When lo, from floor to rafter went up a shattering shout,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"624",13486,"  For aloft in the hand of Sigmund the naked blade shone out","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"625",13486,"  As high o'er his head he shook it: for the sword had come away","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"626",13486,"  From the grip of the heart of the Branstock, as though all loose it lay.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"627",13486,"  A little while he stood there mid the glory of the hall,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"628",13486,"  Like the best of the trees of the garden, when the April sunbeams fall","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"629",13486,"  On its blossomed boughs in the morning, and tell of the days to be;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"630",13486,"  Then back unto the high-seat he wended soberly;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"631",13486,"  For this was the thought within him; Belike the day shall come","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"633",13486,"  Its glory and sole avenger, its after-summer seed.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"634",13486,"  Yea, I am the hired of Odin, his workday will to speed,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"635",13486,"  And the harvest-tide shall be heavy.--What then, were it come and past","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"636",13486,"  And I laid by the last of the sheaves with my wages earned at the last?","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"637",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"638",13486,"  He lifted his eyes as he thought it, for now was he come to his place,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"639",13486,"  And there he stood by his father and met Siggeir face to face,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"640",13486,"  And he saw him blithe and smiling, and heard him how he spake:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"641",13486,"  ""O best of the sons of Volsung, I am merry for thy sake","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"645",13486,"  Or dye the red rose redder? So I prithee let me hold","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"646",13486,"  This sword that comes to thine hand on the day I wed thy kin.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"647",13486,"  For at home have I a store-house; there is mountain-gold therein","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"648",13486,"  The weight of a war-king's harness; there is silver plenteous store;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"649",13486,"  There is iron, and huge-wrought amber, that the southern men love sore,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"654",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"655",13486,"  But Sigmund laughed and answered, and he spake a scornful word:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"656",13486,"  ""And if I take twice that treasure, will it buy me Odin's sword,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"658",13486,"  Betwixt two mightiest world-kings with a longed-for thing in mine hand","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"659",13486,"  That all their might hath missed of? when the purple-selling men","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"660",13486,"  Come buying thine iron and amber, dost thou sell thine honour then?","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"661",13486,"  Do they wrap it in bast of the linden, or run it in moulds of earth?","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"662",13486,"  And shalt thou account mine honour as a matter of lesser worth?","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"663",13486,"  Came the sword to thy wedding, Goth-king, to thine hand it never came,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"665",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"666",13486,"  Black then was the heart of Siggeir, but his face grew pale and red,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"667",13486,"  Till he drew a smile thereover, and spake the word and said:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"668",13486,"  ""Nay, pardon me, Signy's kinsman! when the heart desires o'ermuch","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"669",13486,"  It teacheth the tongue ill speaking, and my word belike was such.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"670",13486,"  But the honour of thee and thy kindred, I hold it even as mine,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"671",13486,"  And I love you as my heart-blood, and take ye this for a sign.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"672",13486,"  I bid thee now King Volsung, and these thy glorious sons,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1592",13486,"  And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1593",13486,"       through,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1620",13486,"  Nay sure, for thy face is shining like the battle-eager men","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1629",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1630",13486,"  So Sigurd said, ""I am ready; and what is the deed to win?""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1631",13486,"  He said: ""We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1633",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1634",13486,"  Then the twain sped on together, and they drave the horses on","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1635",13486,"  Till they came to a rushing river, a water wide and wan;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1636",13486,"  And the white mews hovered o'er it; but none might hear their cry","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1637",13486,"  For the rush and the rattle of waters, as the downlong flood swept by.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1638",13486,"  So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1639",13486,"  And many a brave steed was there; but the flood o'ermastered them:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1640",13486,"  And some, it swept them down-ward, and some won back to bank,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1641",13486,"  Some, caught by the net of the eddies, in the swirling hubbub sank;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1642",13486,"  But one of all swam over, and they saw his mane of grey","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1643",13486,"  Toss over the flowery meadows, a bright thing far away:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1644",13486,"  Wide then he wheeled about them, then took the stream again","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1645",13486,"  And with the waves' white horses mingled his cloudy mane.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1646",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1647",13486,"  Then spake the elder of days: ""Hearken now, Sigurd, and hear;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1648",13486,"  Time was when I gave thy father a gift thou shalt yet deem dear,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1649",13486,"  And this horse is a gift of my giving:--heed nought where thou mayst ride:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1650",13486,"  For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1651",13486,"  And on earth they thought of its threshold, and the gifts I had to give;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1652",13486,"  Nor prayed for a little longer, and a little longer to live.""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1653",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1654",13486,"  Then forth he strode to the mountains, and fain was Sigurd now.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1655",13486,"  To ask him many a matter: but dim did his bright shape grow,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1656",13486,"  As a man from the litten doorway fades into the dusk of night;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1657",13486,"  And the sun in the high-noon shone, and the world was exceeding bright.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1658",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1659",13486,"  So Sigurd turned to the river and stood by the wave-wet strand,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1660",13486,"  And the grey horse swims to his feet and lightly leaps aland,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1661",13486,"  And the youngling looks upon him, and deems none beside him good.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1662",13486,"  And indeed, as tells the story, he was come of Sleipnir's blood,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1663",13486,"  The tireless horse of Odin: cloud-grey he was of hue,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2562",13486,"  And the dry sticks crackled amidst it, and alow the eagles came,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2563",13486,"  And seven they were by tale, and they pitched all round about","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2565",13486,"  But nought he knoweth its wisdom, or the word that they would speak:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2567",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2568",13486,"  Then Sigurd looketh on Regin, and he deemeth it overlong","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2569",13486,"  That he dighteth the dear-bought morsel, and the might for the Master of","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2570",13486,"       wrong,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2571",13486,"  So he reacheth his hand to the roast to see if the cooking be o'er;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2572",13486,"  But the blood and the fat seethed from it and scalded his finger sore,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2577",13486,"  And he knitted his brows and hearkened, and wrath in his heart arose","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2582",13486,"  As he hearkened the voice of the eagles, and their song began to learn.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2583",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2584",13486,"And six of the eagles cried to Sigurd not to tarry before the feast, and","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2597",13486,"  But his lips smile false in his dreaming, and his hand is on the sword;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4165",13486,"  ""Ho, Guttorm, enter, and hearken to the counsel of the wise!""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4166",13486,"  Then in through the door strode Guttorm fair-clad in hunter's guise,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4167",13486,"  With no steel save his wood-knife girded; but his war-fain eyes stared wild,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4168",13486,"  As he spake: ""What words are ye hiding from the youngest Niblung child?","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4169",13486,"  What work is to win, my brethren, that ye sit in warrior's weed,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4170",13486,"  And tell me nought of the glory, and cover up the deed?""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4171",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4172",13486,"  Then uprose Grimhild the wise-wife, and took the cup again;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4173",13486,"  Night-long had she brewed that witch-drink and laboured not in vain.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4174",13486,"  For therein was the creeping venom, and hearts of things that prey","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4175",13486,"  On the hidden lives of ocean, and never look on day;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4176",13486,"  And the heart of the ravening wood-wolf and the hunger-blinded beast","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4177",13486,"  And the spent slaked heart of the wild-fire the guileful cup increased:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4178",13486,"  But huge words of ancient evil about its rim were scored,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4179",13486,"  The curse and the eyeless craving of the first that fashioned sword.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4180",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4181",13486,"  So the cup in her hand was gleaming, as she turned unto Guttorm and spake:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4182",13486,"  ""Be merry, King of the War-fain! we hold counsel for thy sake:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4183",13486,"  The work is a God's son's slaying, and thine is the hand that shall smite,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4185",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4186",13486,"  Forth flashed the flame from his eyen, and he cried: ""Where then is the foe,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4187",13486,"  This dread of mine house and my brethren, that my hand may lay him alow?""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4188",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4189",13486,"  ""Drink, son,"" she said, ""and be merry! and I shall tell his name,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4191",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4192",13486,"  He drinketh and craveth for battle, and his hand for a sword doth seek,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4193",13486,"  And he looketh about on his brethren, but his lips no word may speak;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4194",13486,"  They speak the name, and he hears not, and again he drinks of the cup","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4195",13486,"  And knows not friend nor kindred, and the wrath in his heart wells up,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4196",13486,"  That no God may bear unmingled, and he cries a wordless cry,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4197",13486,"  As the last of the day is departing and the dusk time drawing anigh.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4198",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4199",13486,"  Then Grimhild goes from the chamber, and bringeth his harness of war,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4200",13486,"  And therewith they array his body, and he drinketh the cup once more,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4201",13486,"  And his heart is set on the murder, and now may he understand","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4202",13486,"  What soul is dight for the slaying, and what quarry is for his hand.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4203",13486,"  For again they tell him of Sigurd, and the man he remembereth,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4204",13486,"  And praiseth his mighty name and his deeds that laughed on death.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4205",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4206",13486,"  Now dusk and dark draw over, and through the glimmering house","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4207",13486,"  They go to the place of the Niblungs, the high hall and glorious;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4208",13486,"  For hard by is the chamber of Sigurd: there dight in their harness of war","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4209",13486,"  In their thrones sit Gunnar and Hogni, but Guttorm stands on the floor","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4210",13486,"  With his blue blade naked before them: the torches flare from the wall","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4211",13486,"  And the woven God-folk waver, but the hush is deep in the hall,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4212",13486,"  And those Niblung faces change not, though the slow moon slips from her","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4213",13486,"       height","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4214",13486,"  And earth is acold ere dawning, and new winds shake the night.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4215",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4216",13486,"  Now it was in the earliest dawn-dusk that Guttorm stirred in his place,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4217",13486,"  And the mail-rings tinkled upon him, as he turned his helm-hid face,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4218",13486,"  And went forth from the hall and the high-seat; but the Kings sat still in","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4219",13486,"       their pride","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4220",13486,"  And hearkened the clash of his going and heeded how it died.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4221",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4222",13486,"  Slow, all alone goeth Guttorm to Sigurd's chamber door,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4223",13486,"  And all is open before him, and the white moon lies on the floor","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4224",13486,"  And the bed where Sigurd lieth with Gudrun on his breast,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4225",13486,"  And light comes her breath from her bosom in the joy of infinite rest.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4226",13486,"  Then Guttorm stands on the threshold, and his heart of the murder is fain,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4227",13486,"  And he thinks of the deeds of Sigurd, and praiseth his greatness and gain;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4228",13486,"  Bright blue is his blade in the moonlight--but lo, how Sigurd lies,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4229",13486,"  As the carven dead that die not, with fair wide-open eyes;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4230",13486,"  And their glory gleameth on Guttorm, and the hate in his heart is chilled,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4231",13486,"  And he shrinketh aback from the threshold and knoweth not what he willed.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4232",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4233",13486,"Thereon he turned him again to the hall, and the Kings beheld his","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4234",13486,"unstained sword in the torch-light, but they cast him never a word.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4235",13486,"Then shame and wrath urged him and he wended the second time to","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4236",13486,"Sigurd's chamber, but yet again the dread eyes of the Volsung were","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4237",13486,"open and he fled from their light to his biding brethren.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4238",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4239",13486,"  Now dieth moon and candle, and though the day be nigh","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4240",13486,"  The roof of the hall fair-builded seems far aloof as the sky,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4241",13486,"  But a glimmer grows on the pavement and the ernes on the roof-ridge stir:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4242",13486,"  Then the brethren hist and hearken, for a sound of feet they hear,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4243",13486,"  And into the hall of the Niblungs a white thing cometh apace:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4244",13486,"  But the sword of Guttorm upriseth, and he wendeth from his place,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4245",13486,"  And the clash of steel goes with him; yet loud as it may sound","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4246",13486,"  Still more they hear those footsteps light-falling on the ground,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4247",13486,"  And the hearts of the Niblungs waver, and their pride is smitten acold,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4248",13486,"  For they look on that latest comer, and Brynhild they behold:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4249",13486,"  But she sits by their side in silence, and heeds them nothing more","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4250",13486,"  Than the grey soft-footed morning heeds yester-even's war.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4251",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4252",13486,"  But Guttorm clashed in the cloisters and through the silence strode","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4253",13486,"  And scarce on the threshold of Sigurd a little while abode;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4254",13486,"  There the moon from the floor hath departed and heaven without is grey,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4255",13486,"  And afar in the eastern quarter faint glimmer streaks of day.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4256",13486,"  Close over the head of Sigurd the Wrath gleams wan and bare,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4257",13486,"  And the Niblung woman stirreth, and her brow is knit with fear;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4258",13486,"  But the King's closed eyes are hidden, loose lie his empty hands,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4259",13486,"  There is nought 'twixt the sword of the slayer and the Wonder of all Lands.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4260",13486,"  Then Guttorm laughed in his war-rage, and his sword leapt up on high,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4261",13486,"  As he sprang to the bed from the threshold and cried a wordless cry,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4262",13486,"  And with all the might of the Niblungs through Sigurd's body thrust,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4263",13486,"  And turned and fled from the chamber, and fell amid the dust,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4264",13486,"  Within the door and without it, the slayer slain by the slain;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4265",13486,"  For the cast of the sword of Sigurd had smitten his body atwain","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4266",13486,"  While yet his cry of onset through the echoing chambers went.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4267",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4268",13486,"  Woe's me! how the house of the Niblungs by another cry was rent,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4269",13486,"  The wakening wail of Gudrun, as she shrank in the river of blood","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4270",13486,"  From the breast of the mighty Sigurd: he heard it and understood,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4271",13486,"  And rose up on the sword of Guttorm, and turned from the country of death,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4272",13486,"  And spake words of loving-kindness as he strove for life and breath:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4273",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4274",13486,"  ""Wail not, O child of the Niblungs! I am smitten, but thou shall live,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4276",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4277",13486,"  She stayed her cry to hearken, and her heart well nigh stood still:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4278",13486,"  But he spake: ""Mourn not, O Gudrun, this stroke is the last of ill;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4279",13486,"  Fear leaveth the House of the Niblungs on this breaking of the morn;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4281",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4282",13486,"  Then he sank aback on the sword, and down to his lips she bent","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4283",13486,"  If some sound therefrom she might hearken; for his breath was well-nigh","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4284",13486,"       spent:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4285",13486,"  ""It is Brynhild's deed,"" he murmured, ""and the woman that loves me well;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4286",13486,"  Nought now is left to repent of, and the tale abides to tell.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4287",13486,"  I have done many deeds in my life-days, and all these, and my love, they lie","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4288",13486,"  In the hollow hand of Odin till the day of the world go by.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4289",13486,"  I have done and I may not undo, I have given and I take not again:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4290",13486,"  Art thou other than I, Allfather, wilt thou gather my glory in vain?""","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4291",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4292",13486,"  There was silence then in the chamber, as the dawn spread wide and grey,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4293",13486,"  And hushed was the hall of the Niblungs at the entering-in of day.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4294",13486,"  Long Gudrun hung o'er the Volsung and waited the coming word;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4295",13486,"  Then she stretched out her hand to Sigurd and touched her love and her lord,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4296",13486,"  And the broad day fell on his visage, and she knew she was there alone,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4297",13486,"  And her heart was wrung with anguish and she uttered a weary moan:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4298",13486,"  Then Brynhild laughed in the hall, and the first of men's voices was that","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4299",13486,"  Since when on yester-even the kings in the high-seat had sat.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4303",13486,"  In the house rose rumour and stir, and men stood up in the morn,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4304",13486,"  And their hearts with doubt were shaken, as if with the Uttermost Horn:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4305",13486,"  The cry and the calling spread, and shields clashed down from the wall,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4306",13486,"  And swords in the chamber glittered, and men ran apace to the hall.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4307",13486,"  Nor knew what man to question, nor who had tidings to give,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4308",13486,"  Nor what were the days thenceforward wherein the folk should live.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4309",13486,"  But ever the word is amongst them that Sigurd the Volsung is slain,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4310",13486,"  And the spears in the hall were tossing as the rye in the windy plain.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4311",13486,"  But they look aloft to the high-seat and they see the gleam of the gold:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4312",13486,"  And Gunnar the King of battle, and Hogni wise and cold,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4313",13486,"  And Brynhild the wonder of women; and her face is deadly pale,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4314",13486,"  And the Kings are clad in their war-gear, and bared are the edges of bale.","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4315",13486,"  Then cold fear falleth upon them, but the noise and the clamour abate,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4316",13486,"  And they look on the war-wise Gunnar and awhile for his word they wait;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4317",13486,"  But e'en as he riseth above them, doth a shriek through the tumult ring;","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4320",13486,"","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4321",13486,"  Then nothing faltered Gunnar, but he stood o'er the Niblung folk,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4322",13486,"  And over the hall woe-stricken the words of pride he spoke:","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4324",13486,"  ""Mourn now, O Niblung people, for gone is Sigurd our guest,","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
