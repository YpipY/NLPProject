"214",13821,"grey, and masses of villas every year came skirmishing down our","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"215",13821,"valleys. Our coverts were mostly on the hills, and as the town came","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"216",13821,"down upon the valleys the foxes used to leave them and go right away","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"217",13821,"out of the county and they never returned. I think they went by night","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"218",13821,"and moved great distances. Well it was early April and we had drawn","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"219",13821,"blank all day, and at the last draw of all, the very last of the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"220",13821,"season, we found a fox. He left the covert with his back to London and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"221",13821,"its railways and villas and wire and slipped away towards the chalk","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"229",13821,"clay lands where the bracken grows and came to a valley at the edge of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"230",13821,"the chalk. As we went down into it we saw the fox go up the other side","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"231",13821,"like a shadow that crosses the evening, and glide into a wood that","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"232",13821,"stood on the top. We saw a flash of primroses in the wood and we were","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"233",13821,"out the other side, hounds hunting perfectly and the fox still going","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"234",13821,"absolutely straight. It began to dawn on me then that we were in for a","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"236",13821,"the air of that perfect Spring afternoon as it came to one galloping,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"237",13821,"and the thought of a great run, were together like some old rare wine.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"238",13821,"Our faces now were to another valley, large fields led down to it,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"239",13821,"with easy hedges, at the bottom of it a bright blue stream went","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"240",13821,"singing and a rambling village smoked, the sunlight on the opposite","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"241",13821,"slopes danced like a fairy; and all along the top old woods were","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"249",13821,"remember hearing men sing or shout as they walked home from work, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"250",13821,"sometimes children whistled; the sounds came up from the village to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"251",13821,"the woods at the top of the valley. After that we saw no more","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"252",13821,"villages, but valley after valley arose and fell before us as though","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"253",13821,"we were voyaging some strange and stormy sea, and all the way before","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"260",13821,"within me that this fox was going on straight up-wind till he died or","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"261",13821,"until night came and we could hunt no longer, so I reversed ordinary","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"262",13821,"methods and only cast straight ahead and always we picked up the scent","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"263",13821,"again at once. I believe that this fox was the last one left in the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"268",13821,"Evening began to descend upon the valleys, still the hounds drifted","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"269",13821,"on, like the lazy but unresting shadows of clouds upon a summer's day,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"270",13821,"we heard a shepherd calling to his dog, we saw two maidens move","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"271",13821,"towards a hidden farm, one of them singing softly; no other sounds,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"279",13821,"last landmark I had ever seen before must have been over five miles","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"280",13821,"back and from there to the start was at least ten miles more. If only","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"281",13821,"we could kill! Then the sun set. I wondered what chance we had of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"282",13821,"killing our fox. I looked at James' face as he rode beside me. He did","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"283",13821,"not seem to have lost any confidence yet his horse was as tired as","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"284",13821,"mine. It was a good clear twilight and the scent was as strong as","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"285",13821,"ever, and the fences were easy enough, but those valleys were terribly","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"286",13821,"trying and they still rolled on and on. It looked as if the light","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"287",13821,"would outlast all possible endurance both of the fox and the horses,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"288",13821,"if the scent held good and he did not go to ground, otherwise night","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"289",13821,"would end it. For long we had seen no houses and no roads, only chalk","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"290",13821,"slopes with the twilight on them, and here and there some sheep, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"291",13821,"scattered copses darkening in the evening. At some moment I seemed to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"293",13821,"hovering, I looked at James, he was solemnly shaking his head.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"294",13821,"Suddenly in a little wooded valley we saw climb over the oaks the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"295",13821,"red-brown gables of a queer old house, at that instant I saw the fox","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"296",13821,"scarcely heading by fifty yards. We blundered through a wood into full","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"297",13821,"sight of the house, but no avenue led up to it or even a path nor were","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"298",13821,"there any signs of wheel-marks anywhere. Already lights shone here and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"299",13821,"there in windows. We were in a park, and a fine park, but unkempt","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"300",13821,"beyond credibility; brambles grew everywhere. It was too dark to see","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"305",13821,"the hounds close up on their fox, slipping into the darkness as I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"306",13821,"hesitated. I decided to try it. My horse rose about eight inches and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"307",13821,"took it fair with his breast, and the oak log flew into handfuls of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"308",13821,"wet decay--it rotten with years. And then we were on a lawn and at the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"309",13821,"far end of it the hounds were tumbling over their fox. Fox, hounds and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"310",13821,"light were all done together at the of a twenty-mile point. We made","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"311",13821,"some noise then, but nobody came out of the queer old house.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"334",13821,"look of the hermit; he regretted that he had not room to put me up. I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"335",13821,"was sure that this was untrue, also I had to be put up there, there","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"336",13821,"was nowhere else within miles, so I almost insisted. Then to my","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"337",13821,"astonishment he turned to the butler and they talked it over in an","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"338",13821,"undertone. At last they seemed to think that they could manage it,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"339",13821,"though clearly with reluctance. It was by now seven o' clock and Sir","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"410",13821,"frequently paused in my monologue, like Mark Anthony, for a reply, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"411",13821,"sometimes I turned and spoke to Miss Rosalind Smith. Sir Richard at","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"412",13821,"the other end talked sorrowfully on, he spoke as a condemned man might","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"413",13821,"speak to his judge, and yet somewhat as a judge might speak to one","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"414",13821,"that he once condemned wrongly. My own mind began to turn to mournful","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"415",13821,"things. I drank another glass of champagne, but I was still thirsty. I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"416",13821,"felt as if all the moisture in my body had been blown away over the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"417",13821,"downs of Kent by the wind up which we had galloped. Still I was not","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"418",13821,"talking enough; my host was looking at me. I made another effort,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"419",13821,"after all I had something to talk about, a twenty-mile point is not","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"420",13821,"often seen in a lifetime, especially south of the Thames. I began to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"421",13821,"describe the run to Rosalind Smith. I could see then that my host was","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"422",13821,"pleased, the sad look in his face gave a kind of a flicker, like mist","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"423",13821,"upon the mountains on a miserable day when a faint puff comes from the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"424",13821,"sea and the mist would lift if it could. And the butler refilled my","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"425",13821,"glass very attentively. I asked her first if she hunted, and paused","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"426",13821,"and began my story. I told her where we had found the fox and how fast","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"427",13821,"and straight he had gone, and how I had got through the village by","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"428",13821,"keeping to the road, while the little gardens and wire, and then the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"429",13821,"river, had stopped the rest of the field. I told her the kind of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"430",13821,"country that we crossed and how splendid it looked in the Spring, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"431",13821,"how mysterious the valleys were as soon as the twilight came, and what","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"432",13821,"a glorious horse I had and how wonderfully he went. I was so fearfully","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"433",13821,"thirsty after the great hunt that I had to stop for a moment now and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"434",13821,"then, but I went on with my description of that famous run, for I had","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"435",13821,"warmed to the subject, and after all there was nobody to tell of it","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"436",13821,"but me except my old whipper-in, and ""the old fellow's probably drunk","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"437",13821,"by now,"" I thought. I described to her minutely the exact spot in the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"438",13821,"run at which it had come to me clearly that this was going to be the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"439",13821,"greatest hunt in the whole history of Kent. Sometimes I forgot","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"440",13821,"incidents that had happened as one well may in a run of twenty miles,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"441",13821,"and then I had to fill in the gaps by inventing. I was pleased to be","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"442",13821,"able to make the party go off well by means of my conversation, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"443",13821,"besides that the lady to whom I was speaking was extremely pretty: I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"444",13821,"do not mean in a flesh and blood kind of way but there were little","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"445",13821,"shadowy lines about the chair beside me that hinted at an unusually","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"446",13821,"graceful figure when Miss Rosalind Smith was alive; and I began to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"447",13821,"perceive that what I first mistook for the smoke of guttering candles","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"448",13821,"and a table-cloth waving in the draught was in reality an extremely","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"449",13821,"animated company who listened, and not without interest, to my story","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"450",13821,"of by far the greatest hunt that the world had ever known: indeed I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"451",13821,"told them that I would confidently go further and predict that never","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"452",13821,"in the history of the world would there be such a run again. Only my","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"453",13821,"throat was terribly dry. And then as it seemed they wanted to hear","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"454",13821,"more about my horse. I had forgotten that I had come there on a horse,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"455",13821,"but when they reminded me it all came back; they looked so charming","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"456",13821,"leaning over the table intent upon what I said, that I told them","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"457",13821,"everything they wanted to know. Everything was going so pleasantly if","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"458",13821,"only Sir Richard would cheer up. I heard his mournful voice every now","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"459",13821,"and then--these were very pleasant people if only he would take them","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"460",13821,"the right way. I could understand that he regretted his past, but the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"461",13821,"early seventies seemed centuries away and I felt sure that he","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"462",13821,"misunderstood these ladies, they were not revengeful as he seemed to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"463",13821,"suppose. I wanted to show him how cheerful they really were, and so I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"464",13821,"made a joke and they an laughed at it, and then I chaffed them a bit,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"465",13821,"especially Rosalind, and nobody resented it in the very least. And","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"466",13821,"still Sir Richard sat there with that unhappy look, like one that has","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"467",13821,"ended weeping because it is vain and has not the consolation even of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"468",13821,"tears.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"469",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"470",13821,"We had been a long time there and many of the candles had burned out,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"471",13821,"but there was light enough. I was glad to have an audience for my","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"472",13821,"exploit, and being happy myself I was determined Sir Richard should","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"473",13821,"be. I made more jokes and they still laughed good-naturedly; some of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"474",13821,"the jokes were a little broad perhaps but no harm was meant. And","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"475",13821,"then--I do not wish to excuse myself--but I had had a harder day than","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"476",13821,"I ever had had before and without knowing it I must have been","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"477",13821,"completely exhausted; in this state the champagne had found me, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"478",13821,"what would have been harmless at any other time must somehow have got","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"479",13821,"the better of me when quite tired out--anyhow I went too far, I made","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"480",13821,"some joke--I cannot in the least remember what--that suddenly seemed","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"481",13821,"to offend them. I felt all at once a commotion in the air, I looked up","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"482",13821,"and saw that they had all arisen from the table and were sweeping","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"483",13821,"towards the door: I had not time to open it but it blew open on a","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"484",13821,"wind, I could scarcely see what Sir Richard was doing because only two","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"485",13821,"candles were left, I think the rest blew out when the ladies suddenly","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"486",13821,"rose. I sprang up to apologise, to assure them--and then fatigue","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"487",13821,"overcame me as it had overcome my horse at the last fence, I clutched","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"488",13821,"at the table but the cloth came away and then I fell. The fall, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"489",13821,"the darkness on the floor and the pent up fatigue of the day overcame","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"490",13821,"me all three together.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"492",13821,"The sun shone over glittering fields and in at a bedroom window and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"493",13821,"thousands of birds were chanting to the Spring, and there I was in an","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"494",13821,"old four-poster bed in a quaint old panelled bedroom, fully dressed","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"495",13821,"and wearing long muddy boots; someone had taken my spurs and that was","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"496",13821,"all. For a moment I failed to realise and then it all came back, my","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"497",13821,"enormity and the pressing need of an abject apology to Sir Richard. I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"498",13821,"pulled an embroidered bell rope until the butler came. He came in","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"499",13821,"perfectly cheerful and indescribably shabby. I asked him if Sir","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"500",13821,"Richard was up, and he said he had just gone down, and told me to my","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"501",13821,"amazement that it was twelve o'clock. I asked to be shown in to Sir","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"502",13821,"Richard at once. He was in his smoking-room. ""Good morning,"" he said","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"503",13821,"cheerfully the moment I went in. I went directly to the matter in","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"504",13821,"hand. ""I fear that I insulted some ladies in your house--"" I began.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"505",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"506",13821,"""You did indeed,"" he said, ""You did indeed."" And then he burst into","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"507",13821,"tears and took me by the hand. ""How can I ever thank you?"" he said to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"508",13821,"me then. ""We have been thirteen at table for thirty years and I never","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"509",13821,"dared to insult them because I had wronged them all, and now you have","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"510",13821,"done it and I know they will never dine here again."" And for a long","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"511",13821,"time he still held my hand, and then he gave it a grip and a kind of a","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"512",13821,"shake which I took to mean ""Goodbye"" and I drew my hand away then and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"513",13821,"left the house. And I found James in the stables with the hounds and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"514",13821,"asked him how he had fared, and James, who is a man of very few words,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"515",13821,"said he could not rightly remember, and I got my spurs from the butler","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"516",13821,"and climbed on to my horse and slowly we rode away from that queer old","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"517",13821,"house, and slowly we wended home, for the hounds were footsore but","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"518",13821,"happy and the horses were tired still. And when we recalled that the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"519",13821,"hunting season was ended we turned our faces to Spring and thought of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"542",13821,"grew worse till the thing was becoming intolerable. So I took a stick","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"543",13821,"and a knapsack and began walking northwards, starting at Tetherington","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"548",13821,"wold, who could not be thoroughly vulgar, because they had not the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"549",13821,"money to be so even if they had wished it. At first the novelty was","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"550",13821,"delightful, and then one day in a queer old inn up Uthering way,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"551",13821,"beyond Lingwold, I heard for the first time the rumour of the city","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"553",13821,"their glasses of beer, two farmers at the inn. ""They say the queer","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"555",13821,"they seem to be,"" said the other. And more came in then and the rumour","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"556",13821,"spread. And then, such are the contradictions of our little likes and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"557",13821,"dislikes and all the whims that drive us, that I, who had come so far","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"604",13821,"standing motionless, gazing stupidly at his sheep; his hands trembled","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"605",13821,"continually and his eyes had a blear look, but he was quite sober,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"606",13821,"wherein all Lingwold had wronged him.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"607",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"608",13821,"And then and there I asked him of the city and he said he had never","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"609",13821,"heard tell of any such place. And I said, ""Come, come, you must pull","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"610",13821,"yourself together."" And he looked angrily at me; but when he saw me","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"611",13821,"draw from amongst my purchases a full bottle of whiskey and a big","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"612",13821,"glass he became more friendly. As I poured out the whiskey I asked him","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"613",13821,"again about the marble city on Mallington Moor but he seemed quite","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"614",13821,"honestly to know nothing about it. The amount of whiskey he drank was","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"615",13821,"quite incredible, but I seldom express surprise and once more I asked","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"616",13821,"him the way to the wonderful city. His hand was steadier now and his","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"617",13821,"eyes more intelligent and he said that he had heard something of some","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"618",13821,"such city, but his memory was evidently blurred and he was still","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"619",13821,"unable to give me useful directions. I consequently gave him another","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"620",13821,"tumbler, which he drank off like the first without any water, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"621",13821,"almost at once he was a different man. The trembling in his hands","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"622",13821,"stopped altogether, his eye became as quick as a younger man's, he","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"623",13821,"answered my questions readily and frankly, and, what was more","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"624",13821,"important to me still, his old memory became alert and clear for even","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"625",13821,"minutest details. His gratitude to myself I need not mention, for I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"626",13821,"make no pretence that I bought the bottle of whiskey that the old","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"627",13821,"shepherd enjoyed so much without at least some thought of my own","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"628",13821,"advantage. Yet it was pleasant to reflect that it was due to me that","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"629",13821,"he had pulled himself together and steadied his shaking hand and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"630",13821,"cleared his mind, recovered his memory and his self-respect. He spoke","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"631",13821,"to me quite clearly, no longer slurring his words; he had seen the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"632",13821,"city first one moonlight night when he was lost in the mist on the big","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"633",13821,"moor, he had wandered far in the mist, and when it lifted he saw the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"634",13821,"city by moonlight. He had no food, but luckily had his flask. There","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"635",13821,"never was such a city, not even in books. Travellers talked sometimes","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"636",13821,"of Venice seen from the sea, there might be such a place or there","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"637",13821,"might not, but, whether or no, it was nothing to the city on","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"638",13821,"Mallington Moor. Men who read books had talked to him in his time,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"639",13821,"hundreds of books, but they never could tell of any city like this.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"640",13821,"Why, the place was all of marble, roads, walls and palaces, all pure","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"641",13821,"white marble, and the tops of the tall thin spires were entirely of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"642",13821,"gold. And they were queer folk in the city even for foreigners. And","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"643",13821,"there were camels, but I cut him short for I thought I could judge for","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"644",13821,"myself, if there was such a place, and, if not, I was wasting my time","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"645",13821,"as well as a pint of good whiskey. So I got him to speak of the way,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"646",13821,"and after more circumlocution than I needed and more talk of the city","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"647",13821,"he pointed to a tiny track on the black earth just beside us, a little","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"648",13821,"twisty way you could hardly see.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"649",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"650",13821,"I said the moor was trackless; untrodden of man or dog it certainly","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"651",13821,"was and seemed to have less to do with the ways of man than any waste","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"652",13821,"I have seen, but the track the old shepherd showed me, if track it","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"653",13821,"was, was no more than the track of a hare--an elf-path the old man","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"654",13821,"called it, Heaven knows what he meant. And then before I left him he","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"655",13821,"insisted on giving me his flask with the queer strong rum it","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"656",13821,"contained. Whiskey brings out in some men melancholy, in some","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"657",13821,"rejoicing, with him it was clearly generosity and he insisted until I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"658",13821,"took his rum, though I did not mean to drink it. It was lonely up","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"659",13821,"there, he said, and bitter cold and the city hard to find, being set","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"660",13821,"in a hollow, and I should need the rum, and he had never seen the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"661",13821,"marble city except on days when he had had his flask: he seemed to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"662",13821,"regard that rusted iron flask as a sort of mascot, and in the end I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"663",13821,"took it.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"664",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"665",13821,"I followed that odd, faint track on the black earth under the heather","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"666",13821,"till I came to the big grey stone beyond the horizon, where the track","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"667",13821,"divides into two, and I took the one to the left as the old man told","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"668",13821,"me. I knew by another stone that I saw far off that I had not lost my","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"669",13821,"way, nor the old man lied.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"670",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"671",13821,"And just as I hoped to see the city's ramparts before the gloaming","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"672",13821,"fell on that desolate place, I suddenly saw a long high wall of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"673",13821,"whiteness with pinnacles here and there thrown up above it, floating","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"674",13821,"towards me silent and grim as a secret, and knew it for that evil","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"675",13821,"thing the mist. The sun, though low, was shining on every sprig of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"676",13821,"heather, the green and scarlet mosses were shining with it too, it","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"677",13821,"seemed incredible that in three minutes' time all those colours would","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"678",13821,"be gone and nothing left all round but a grey darkness. I gave up hope","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"679",13821,"of finding the city that day, a broader path than mine could have been","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"680",13821,"quite easily lost. I hastily chose for my bed a thick patch of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"681",13821,"heather, wrapped myself in a waterproof cloak, and lay down and made","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"682",13821,"myself comfortable. And then the mist came. It came like the careful","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"683",13821,"pulling of lace curtains, then like the drawing of grey blinds; it","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"684",13821,"shut out the horizon to the north, then to the east and west; it","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"685",13821,"turned the whole sky white and hid the moor; it came down on it like a","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"686",13821,"metropolis, only utterly silent, silent and white as tombstones.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"687",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"688",13821,"And then I was glad of that strange strong rum, or whatever it was in","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"689",13821,"the flask that the shepherd gave me, for I did not think that the mist","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"690",13821,"would clear till night, and I feared the night would be cold. So I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"691",13821,"nearly emptied the flask; and, sooner than I expected, I fell asleep,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"692",13821,"for the first night out as a rule one does not sleep at once but is","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"693",13821,"kept awake some while by the little winds and the unfamiliar sound of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"694",13821,"the things that wander at night, and that cry to one another far-off","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"695",13821,"with their queer, faint voices; one misses them afterwards when one","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"696",13821,"gets to houses again. But I heard none of these sounds in the mist","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"697",13821,"that evening.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"698",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"699",13821,"And then I woke and found that the mist was gone and the sun was just","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"700",13821,"disappearing under the moor, and I knew that I had not slept for as","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"701",13821,"long as I thought. And I decided to go on while I could, for I thought","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"702",13821,"that I was not very far from the city.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"703",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"704",13821,"I went on and on along the twisty track, bits of the mist came down","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"705",13821,"and filled the hollows but lifted again at once so that I saw my way.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"706",13821,"The twilight faded as I went, a star appeared, and I was able to see","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"707",13821,"the track no longer. I could go no further that night, yet before I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"708",13821,"lay down to sleep I decided to go and look over the edge of a wide","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"709",13821,"depression in the moor that I saw a little way off. So I left the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"710",13821,"track and walked a few hundred yards, and when I got to the edge the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"711",13821,"hollow was full of mist all white underneath me. Another star appeared","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"712",13821,"and a cold wind arose, and with the wind the mist flapped away like a","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"713",13821,"curtain. And there was the city.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"714",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"715",13821,"Nothing the shepherd had said was the least untrue or even","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"716",13821,"exaggerated. The poor old man had told the simple truth, there is not","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"717",13821,"a city like it in the world. What he had called thin spires were","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"718",13821,"minarets, but the little domes on the top were clearly pure gold as he","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"719",13821,"said. There were the marble terraces he described and the pure white","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"720",13821,"palaces covered with carving and hundreds of minarets. The city was","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"721",13821,"obviously of the East and yet where there should have been crescents","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"722",13821,"on the domes of the minarets there were golden suns with rays, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"723",13821,"wherever one looked one saw things that obscured its origin. I walked","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"724",13821,"down to it, and, passing through a wicket gate of gold in a low wall","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"725",13821,"of white marble, I entered the city. The heather went right up to the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"726",13821,"city's edge and beat against the marble wall whenever the wind blew","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"727",13821,"it. Lights began to twinkle from high windows of blue glass as I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"728",13821,"walked up the white street, beautiful copper lanterns were lit up and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"729",13821,"let down from balconies by silver chains, from doors ajar came the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"730",13821,"sound of voices singing, and then I saw the men. Their faces were","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"731",13821,"rather grey than black, and they wore beautiful robes of coloured silk","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"732",13821,"with hems embroidered with gold and some with copper, and sometimes","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"733",13821,"pacing down the marble ways with golden baskets hung on each side of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"736",13821,"The people had kindly faces, but, though they were evidently friendly","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"737",13821,"to strangers, I could not speak with them being ignorant of their","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"738",13821,"language, nor were the sounds of the syllables they used like any","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"739",13821,"language I had ever heard: they sounded more like grouse.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"741",13821,"When I tried to ask them by signs whence they had come with their city","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"742",13821,"they would only point to the moon, which was bright and full and was","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"743",13821,"shining fiercely on those marble ways till the city danced in light.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"744",13821,"And now there began appearing one by one, slipping softly out through","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"745",13821,"windows, men with stringed instruments in the balconies. They were","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"746",13821,"strange instruments with huge bulbs of wood, and they played softly on","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"747",13821,"them and very beautifully, and their queer voices softly sang to the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"748",13821,"music weird dirges of the griefs of their native land wherever that","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"749",13821,"may be. And far off in the heart of the city others were singing too,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"750",13821,"the sound of it came to me wherever I roamed, not loud enough to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"751",13821,"disturb my thoughts, but gently turning the mind to pleasant things.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"752",13821,"Slender carved arches of marble, as delicate almost as lace, crossed","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"753",13821,"and re-crossed the ways wherever I went. There was none of that hurry","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"754",13821,"of which foolish cities boast, nothing ugly or sordid so far as I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"755",13821,"could see. I saw that it was a city of beauty and song. I wondered how","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"756",13821,"they had travelled with all that marble, how they had laid it down on","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"757",13821,"Mallington Moor, whence they had come and what their resources were,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"758",13821,"and determined to investigate closely next morning, for the old","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"759",13821,"shepherd had not troubled his head to think how the city came, he had","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"760",13821,"only noted that the city was there (and of course no one believed him,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"761",13821,"though that is partly his fault for his dissolute ways). But at night","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"762",13821,"one can see little and I had walked all day, so I determined to find a","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"763",13821,"place to rest in. And just as I was wondering whether to ask for","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"764",13821,"shelter of those silk-robed men by signs or whether to sleep outside","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"765",13821,"the walls and enter again in the morning, I came to a great archway in","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"766",13821,"one of the marble houses with two black curtains, embroidered below","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3295",13821,"he played the fifth variation with its tricky seventh move, at least","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3305",13821,"mind; and for a long while I could not. And then I heard Adam Bailey","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3306",13821,"mutter six words, the only words I heard throughout the game, of all","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3307",13821,"their consultations, ""No, him with the horse's head."" And I decided","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3309",13821,"might have been explaining things to Bill Sloggs, but it did not sound","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3310",13821,"like that; so that left Bill Sloggs. I watched Bill Sloggs after that","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3311",13821,"with a certain wonder; he was no more intellectual than the others to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3312",13821,"look at, though rather more forceful perhaps. Poor old Stavlokratz was","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3317",13821,"three or none: and then I went back with Stavlokratz to his lodgings.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3318",13821,"He very kindly gave me a game: of course it did not last long but I am","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3319",13821,"prouder of having been beaten by Stavlokratz than of any game that I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3320",13821,"have ever won. And then we talked for an hour about the sailors, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3321",13821,"neither of us could make head or tail of them. I told him what I had","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3322",13821,"noticed about Jim Bunion and Adam Bailey, and he agreed with me that","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3323",13821,"Bill Sloggs was the man, though as to how he had come by that gambit","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3328",13821,"to the tavern, and found there still the three sailors. And I offered","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3329",13821,"Bill Sloggs two pounds for a game with him alone and he refused, but","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3330",13821,"in the end he played me for a drink. And then I found that he had not","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3331",13821,"heard of the ""en passant"" rule, and believed that the fact of checking","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3332",13821,"the king prevented him from castling, and did not know that a player","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3333",13821,"can have two or more queens on the board at the same time if he queens","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3334",13821,"his pawns, or that a pawn could ever become a knight; and he made as","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3335",13821,"many of the stock mistakes as he had time for in a short game, which I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3336",13821,"won. I thought that I should have got at the secret then, but his","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3337",13821,"mates who had sat scowling all the while in the corner came up and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3338",13821,"interfered. It was a breach of their compact apparently for one to","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3339",13821,"play by himself, at any rate they seemed angry. So I left the tavern","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3369",13821,"that they didn't know what thunder was. But then I interrupted him,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3378",13821,"out in the crystal, and then your move appeared after it, and all you","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3379",13821,"had to do was to make it on the board. If you didn't make the move","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3380",13821,"that you saw in the crystal things got very bad in it, everything","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3381",13821,"horribly mixed and moving about rapidly, and scowling and making the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3382",13821,"same move over and over again, and the crystal getting cloudier and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3383",13821,"cloudier; it was best to take one's eyes away from it then, or one","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3393",13821,"out that I did not believe in the crystal. Well, Jim Bunion leaned","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3394",13821,"forward then, even further across the table, and swore he had seen the","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3395",13821,"man from whom Bill had bought the crystal and that he was one to whom","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3396",13821,"anything was possible. To begin with his hair was villainously dark,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3397",13821,"and his features were unmistakable even down there in the South, and","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3398",13821,"he could play chess with his eyes shut, and even then he could beat","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3399",13821,"anyone in Cuba. But there was more than this, there was the bargain he","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3400",13821,"made with Bill that told one who he was. He sold that crystal for Bill","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3415",13821,"and thrust his face close to mine and asked me several times if I","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3416",13821,"called Bill Snyth silly. It seemed that these three sailors thought a","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3417",13821,"great deal of Bill Snyth and it made Jim Bunion angry to hear anything","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3418",13821,"said against him. I hastened to say that the bargain seemed silly","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3419",13821,"though not of course the man who made it; for the sailor was almost","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3425",13821,"got the best of Bill Snyth and that that was the worst bargain for","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3426",13821,"himself that the Devil ever made, and that from all he had read or","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3427",13821,"heard of the Devil he had never been so badly had before as the night","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3432",13821,"","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"3439",13821,"But I had more questions to ask and interrupted this reminiscence. Why","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3440",13821,"did they all three always play together? And a look of something like","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3441",13821,"fear came over Jim Bunion's face; and at first he would not speak. And","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3442",13821,"then he said to me that it was like this; they had not paid for that","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3443",13821,"crystal, but got it as their share of Bill Snyth's kit. If they had","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3444",13821,"paid for it or given something in exchange to Bill Snyth that would","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3445",13821,"have been all right, but they couldn't do that now because Bill was","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3446",13821,"dead, and they were not sure if the old bargain might not hold good.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3447",13821,"And Hell must be a large and lonely place, and to go there alone must","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3448",13821,"be bad, and so the three agreed that they would all stick together,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3449",13821,"and use the crystal all three or not at all, unless one died, and then","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3450",13821,"the two would use it and the one that was gone would wait for them.","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3451",13821,"And the last of the three to go would take the crystal with him, or","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3452",13821,"maybe the crystal would bring him. They didn't think, they said, they","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3453",13821,"were the kind of men for Heaven, and he hoped they knew their place","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3454",13821,"better than that, but they didn't fancy the notion of Hell alone, if","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3455",13821,"Hell it had to be. It was all right for Bill Snyth, he was afraid of","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3456",13821,"nothing. He had known perhaps five men that were not afraid of death,","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"3457",13821,"but Bill Snyth was not afraid of Hell. He died with a smile on his","Tales of Wonder","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
