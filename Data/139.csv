"5291",139,"conscious of a low, rumbling sound, a continuous murmur, somewhere in","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5292",139,"front of me.  This grew louder as I proceeded, until at last it was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5293",139,"clearly quite close to me.  When I stood still the sound was constant,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5294",139,"so that it seemed to come from some stationary cause.  It was like a","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5295",139,"boiling kettle or the bubbling of some great pot.  Soon I came upon the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5296",139,"source of it, for in the center of a small clearing I found a lake--or","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5297",139,"a pool, rather, for it was not larger than the basin of the Trafalgar","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5298",139,"Square fountain--of some black, pitch-like stuff, the surface of which","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5299",139,"rose and fell in great blisters of bursting gas.  The air above it was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5300",139,"shimmering with heat, and the ground round was so hot that I could","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5301",139,"hardly bear to lay my hand on it.  It was clear that the great volcanic","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5302",139,"outburst which had raised this strange plateau so many years ago had","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5303",139,"not yet entirely spent its forces.  Blackened rocks and mounds of lava","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5304",139,"I had already seen everywhere peeping out from amid the luxuriant","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5305",139,"vegetation which draped them, but this asphalt pool in the jungle was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5306",139,"the first sign that we had of actual existing activity on the slopes of","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5307",139,"the ancient crater.  I had no time to examine it further for I had need","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5310",139,"It was a fearsome walk, and one which will be with me so long as memory","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5311",139,"holds.  In the great moonlight clearings I slunk along among the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5312",139,"shadows on the margin.  In the jungle I crept forward, stopping with a","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5313",139,"beating heart whenever I heard, as I often did, the crash of breaking","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5314",139,"branches as some wild beast went past.  Now and then great shadows","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5315",139,"loomed up for an instant and were gone--great, silent shadows which","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5316",139,"seemed to prowl upon padded feet.  How often I stopped with the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5317",139,"intention of returning, and yet every time my pride conquered my fear,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5321",139,"gleam of water amid the openings of the jungle, and ten minutes later I","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5322",139,"was among the reeds upon the borders of the central lake.  I was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5323",139,"exceedingly dry, so I lay down and took a long draught of its waters,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5324",139,"which were fresh and cold.  There was a broad pathway with many tracks","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5325",139,"upon it at the spot which I had found, so that it was clearly one of","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5326",139,"the drinking-places of the animals.  Close to the water's edge there","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5327",139,"was a huge isolated block of lava.  Up this I climbed, and, lying on","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5331",139,"the view from the summit of the great tree, I said that on the farther","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5332",139,"cliff I could see a number of dark spots, which appeared to be the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5333",139,"mouths of caves.  Now, as I looked up at the same cliffs, I saw discs","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5334",139,"of light in every direction, ruddy, clearly-defined patches, like the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5335",139,"port-holes of a liner in the darkness.  For a moment I thought it was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5336",139,"the lava-glow from some volcanic action; but this could not be so.  Any","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5337",139,"volcanic action would surely be down in the hollow and not high among","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5338",139,"the rocks.  What, then, was the alternative?  It was wonderful, and yet","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5339",139,"it must surely be.  These ruddy spots must be the reflection of fires","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5340",139,"within the caves--fires which could only be lit by the hand of man.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5341",139,"There were human beings, then, upon the plateau.  How gloriously my","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5347",139,"distance one could observe how, from time to time, they twinkled or","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5349",139,"given to be able to crawl up to them, to peep in, and to take back some","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5350",139,"word to my comrades as to the appearance and character of the race who","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5356",139,"with a reflected moon shining brightly in the center of it.  It was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5357",139,"shallow, for in many places I saw low sandbanks protruding above the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5358",139,"water.  Everywhere upon the still surface I could see signs of life,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5359",139,"sometimes mere rings and ripples in the water, sometimes the gleam of a","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5360",139,"great silver-sided fish in the air, sometimes the arched, slate-colored","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5361",139,"back of some passing monster.  Once upon a yellow sandbank I saw a","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5362",139,"creature like a huge swan, with a clumsy body and a high, flexible","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5363",139,"neck, shuffling about upon the margin.  Presently it plunged in, and","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5364",139,"for some time I could see the arched neck and darting head undulating","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5365",139,"over the water.  Then it dived, and I saw it no more.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5366",139,"","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5367",139,"My attention was soon drawn away from these distant sights and brought","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5368",139,"back to what was going on at my very feet.  Two creatures like large","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5369",139,"armadillos had come down to the drinking-place, and were squatting at","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5370",139,"the edge of the water, their long, flexible tongues like red ribbons","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5371",139,"shooting in and out as they lapped.  A huge deer, with branching horns,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5372",139,"a magnificent creature which carried itself like a king, came down with","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5373",139,"its doe and two fawns and drank beside the armadillos.  No such deer","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5375",139,"would hardly have reached its shoulders.  Presently it gave a warning","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5376",139,"snort, and was off with its family among the reeds, while the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5377",139,"armadillos also scuttled for shelter.  A new-comer, a most monstrous","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5378",139,"animal, was coming down the path.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5382",139,"bird-like head held close to the ground.  Then it came back, to me.  It","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5383",139,"was the stegosaurus--the very creature which Maple White had preserved","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5384",139,"in his sketch-book, and which had been the first object which arrested","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5385",139,"the attention of Challenger!  There he was--perhaps the very specimen","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5386",139,"which the American artist had encountered.  The ground shook beneath","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5387",139,"his tremendous weight, and his gulpings of water resounded through the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5389",139,"stretching out my hand I could have touched the hideous waving hackles","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5392",139,"Looking at my watch, I saw that it was half-past two o'clock, and high","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5393",139,"time, therefore, that I started upon my homeward journey.  There was no","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5394",139,"difficulty about the direction in which I should return for all along I","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5397",139,"I set off, therefore, in high spirits, for I felt that I had done good","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5398",139,"work and was bringing back a fine budget of news for my companions.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5399",139,"Foremost of all, of course, were the sight of the fiery caves and the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5400",139,"certainty that some troglodytic race inhabited them.  But besides that","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5401",139,"I could speak from experience of the central lake.  I could testify","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5402",139,"that it was full of strange creatures, and I had seen several land","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5403",139,"forms of primeval life which we had not before encountered.  I","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5409",139,"mind was brought back to my own position by a strange noise behind me.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5410",139,"It was something between a snore and a growl, low, deep, and","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5411",139,"exceedingly menacing.  Some strange creature was evidently near me, but","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5412",139,"nothing could be seen, so I hastened more rapidly upon my way.  I had","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5413",139,"traversed half a mile or so when suddenly the sound was repeated, still","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5414",139,"behind me, but louder and more menacing than before.  My heart stood","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5415",139,"still within me as it flashed across me that the beast, whatever it","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5416",139,"was, must surely be after ME.   My skin grew cold and my hair rose at","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5417",139,"the thought.  That these monsters should tear each other to pieces was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5418",139,"a part of the strange struggle for existence, but that they should turn","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5419",139,"upon modern man, that they should deliberately track and hunt down the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5420",139,"predominant human, was a staggering and fearsome thought.  I remembered","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5421",139,"again the blood-beslobbered face which we had seen in the glare of Lord","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5422",139,"John's torch, like some horrible vision from the deepest circle of","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5423",139,"Dante's hell.  With my knees shaking beneath me, I stood and glared","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5424",139,"with starting eyes down the moonlit path which lay behind me.  All was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5425",139,"quiet as in a dream landscape.  Silver clearings and the black patches","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5426",139,"of the bushes--nothing else could I see.  Then from out of the silence,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5427",139,"imminent and threatening, there came once more that low, throaty","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5428",139,"croaking, far louder and closer than before.  There could no longer be","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5429",139,"a doubt.  Something was on my trail, and was closing in upon me every","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5430",139,"minute.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5431",139,"","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5432",139,"I stood like a man paralyzed, still staring at the ground which I had","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5433",139,"traversed.  Then suddenly I saw it.  There was movement among the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5434",139,"bushes at the far end of the clearing which I had just traversed.  A","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5435",139,"great dark shadow disengaged itself and hopped out into the clear","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5436",139,"moonlight.  I say ""hopped"" advisedly, for the beast moved like a","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5437",139,"kangaroo, springing along in an erect position upon its powerful hind","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5438",139,"legs, while its front ones were held bent in front of it.  It was of","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5439",139,"enormous size and power, like an erect elephant, but its movements, in","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5440",139,"spite of its bulk, were exceedingly alert.  For a moment, as I saw its","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5441",139,"shape, I hoped that it was an iguanodon, which I knew to be harmless,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5442",139,"but, ignorant as I was, I soon saw that this was a very different","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5443",139,"creature.  Instead of the gentle, deer-shaped head of the great","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5444",139,"three-toed leaf-eater, this beast had a broad, squat, toad-like face","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5445",139,"like that which had alarmed us in our camp.  His ferocious cry and the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5446",139,"horrible energy of his pursuit both assured me that this was surely one","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5447",139,"of the great flesh-eating dinosaurs, the most terrible beasts which","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5448",139,"have ever walked this earth.  As the huge brute loped along it dropped","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5449",139,"forward upon its fore-paws and brought its nose to the ground every","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5450",139,"twenty yards or so.  It was smelling out my trail.  Sometimes, for an","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5451",139,"instant, it was at fault.  Then it would catch it up again and come","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5453",139,"","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5456",139,"help could I get from that?  I looked desperately round for some rock","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5457",139,"or tree, but I was in a bushy jungle with nothing higher than a sapling","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5458",139,"within sight, while I knew that the creature behind me could tear down","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5459",139,"an ordinary tree as though it were a reed.  My only possible chance lay","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5460",139,"in flight.  I could not move swiftly over the rough, broken ground, but","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5461",139,"as I looked round me in despair I saw a well-marked, hard-beaten path","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5462",139,"which ran across in front of me.  We had seen several of the sort, the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5463",139,"runs of various wild beasts, during our expeditions.  Along this I","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5464",139,"could perhaps hold my own, for I was a fast runner, and in excellent","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5465",139,"condition.  Flinging away my useless gun, I set myself to do such a","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5466",139,"half-mile as I have never done before or since.  My limbs ached, my","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5468",139,"yet with that horror behind me I ran and I ran and ran.  At last I","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5469",139,"paused, hardly able to move.  For a moment I thought that I had thrown","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5470",139,"him off.  The path lay still behind me.  And then suddenly, with a","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5471",139,"crashing and a rending, a thudding of giant feet and a panting of","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5483",139,"the thick, gasping breathing of the creature sounded louder and louder.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5486",139,"through space, and everything beyond was darkness and rest.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5490",139,"penetrating smell.  Putting out my hand in the darkness I came upon","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5491",139,"something which felt like a huge lump of meat, while my other hand","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5492",139,"closed upon a large bone.  Up above me there was a circle of starlit","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5493",139,"sky, which showed me that I was lying at the bottom of a deep pit.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5494",139,"Slowly I staggered to my feet and felt myself all over.  I was stiff","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5495",139,"and sore from head to foot, but there was no limb which would not move,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5496",139,"no joint which would not bend.  As the circumstances of my fall came","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5497",139,"back into my confused brain, I looked up in terror, expecting to see","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5498",139,"that dreadful head silhouetted against the paling sky.  There was no","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5499",139,"sign of the monster, however, nor could I hear any sound from above.  I","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5504",139,"It was, as I have said, a pit, with sharply-sloping walls and a level","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5505",139,"bottom about twenty feet across.  This bottom was littered with great","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5506",139,"gobbets of flesh, most of which was in the last state of putridity.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5509",139,"hard, and I found that an upright post was firmly fixed in the center","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5510",139,"of the hollow.  It was so high that I could not reach the top of it","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5515",139,"place into which I had fallen.  There could be no question as to its","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5516",139,"nature.  It was a trap--made by the hand of man.  The post in the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5517",139,"center, some nine feet long, was sharpened at the upper end, and was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5518",139,"black with the stale blood of the creatures who had been impaled upon","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5520",139,"had been cut away in order to clear the stake for the next who might","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5521",139,"blunder in.  I remembered that Challenger had declared that man could","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5522",139,"not exist upon the plateau, since with his feeble weapons he could not","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5523",139,"hold his own against the monsters who roamed over it.  But now it was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5524",139,"clear enough how it could be done.  In their narrow-mouthed caves the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5525",139,"natives, whoever they might be, had refuges into which the huge","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5533",139,"dreadful creature which had so nearly destroyed me.  How did I know","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5534",139,"that he was not lurking in the nearest clump of bushes, waiting for my","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5537",139,"Both were agreed that the monsters were practically brainless, that","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5544",139,"what had happened to me, and this in turn would argue some power","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5548",139,"astonishment, would wander away in search of some other prey?  I","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5549",139,"clambered to the edge of the pit and looked over.  The stars were","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5550",139,"fading, the sky was whitening, and the cold wind of morning blew","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5551",139,"pleasantly upon my face.  I could see or hear nothing of my enemy.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5552",139,"Slowly I climbed out and sat for a while upon the ground, ready to","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5553",139,"spring back into my refuge if any danger should appear.  Then,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5554",139,"reassured by the absolute stillness and by the growing light, I took my","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5555",139,"courage in both hands and stole back along the path which I had come.","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5556",139,"Some distance down it I picked up my gun, and shortly afterwards struck","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5562",139,"note of a single rifle-shot.  I paused and listened, but there was","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5563",139,"nothing more.  For a moment I was shocked at the thought that some","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5564",139,"sudden danger might have befallen them.  But then a simpler and more","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5565",139,"natural explanation came to my mind.  It was now broad daylight.  No","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5566",139,"doubt my absence had been noticed.  They had imagined, that I was lost","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5567",139,"in the woods, and had fired this shot to guide me home.  It is true","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5587",139,"bad dream, of rushing about through the woods all round the empty camp,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5588",139,"calling wildly for my companions.  No answer came back from the silent","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5602",139,"The whole disordered appearance of the camp showed that there had been","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5603",139,"some sort of attack, and the rifle-shot no doubt marked the time when","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5604",139,"it had occurred.  That there should have been only one shot showed that","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5606",139,"ground, and one of them--Lord John's--had the empty cartridge in the","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5607",139,"breech.  The blankets of Challenger and of Summerlee beside the fire","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5608",139,"suggested that they had been asleep at the time.  The cases of","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5610",139,"with our unfortunate cameras and plate-carriers, but none of them were","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"5611",139,"missing.  On the other hand, all the exposed provisions--and I","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"5634",139,"to my amazement, a second man was seated in front of him.  For an","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"

"6271",139,"hairless, well formed, and good-humored.  The lobes of their ears,","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
"6272",139,"hanging ragged and bloody, showed that they had been pierced for some","The Lost World","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Science Fiction","en"
