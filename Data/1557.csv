"85",1557,"about a matter he did not understand, excepting that the armed men who","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"99",1557,"the bench beside him, and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow. A","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"100",1557,"clerk sat at the other end of the same table, with inkhorn in one hand","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"300",1557,"second look had showed his practised eye that Myles was not only holding","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"301",1557,"his own, but was in the way of winning the victory. So he had stood with","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"305",1557,"redoubtable affair, but old Diccon was not so silent with the common","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"306",1557,"folk of Crosbey-Dale, and so no doubt the father had some inkling of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"307",1557,"what had happened. It was shortly after this notable event that Myles","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"649",1557,"THE EARL of Mackworth, as was customary among the great lords in those","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"650",1557,"days, maintained a small army of knights, gentlemen, men-at-arms, and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"651",1557,"retainers, who were expected to serve him upon all occasions of need,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"652",1557,"and from whom were supplied his quota of recruits to fill such levies as","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"654",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"655",1557,"The knights and gentlemen of this little army of horse and foot soldiers","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"656",1557,"were largely recruited from the company of squires and bachelors, as the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"657",1557,"young novitiate soldiers of the castle were called.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"658",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"659",1557,"This company of esquires consisted of from eighty to ninety lads,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"660",1557,"ranging in age from eight to twenty years. Those under fourteen years","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"661",1557,"were termed pages, and served chiefly the Countess and her waiting","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"662",1557,"gentlewomen, in whose company they acquired the graces and polish of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"663",1557,"times, such as they were. After reaching the age of fourteen the lads","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"664",1557,"were entitled to the name of esquire or squire.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"665",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"666",1557,"In most of the great houses of the time the esquires were the especial","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"667",1557,"attendants upon the Lord and Lady of the house, holding such positions","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"668",1557,"as body-squires, cup-bearers, carvers, and sometimes the office of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"669",1557,"chamberlain. But Devlen, like some other of the princely castles of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"670",1557,"greatest nobles, was more like a military post or a fortress than an","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"671",1557,"ordinary household. Only comparatively few of the esquires could be","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"672",1557,"used in personal attendance upon the Earl; the others were trained","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"673",1557,"more strictly in arms, and served rather in the capacity of a sort of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"674",1557,"body-guard than as ordinary squires. For, as the Earl rose in power and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"675",1557,"influence, and as it so became well worth while for the lower nobility","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"676",1557,"and gentry to enter their sons in his family, the body of squires became","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"677",1557,"almost cumbersomely large. Accordingly, that part which comprised the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"678",1557,"squires proper, as separate from the younger pages, was divided into","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"679",1557,"three classes--first, squires of the body, who were those just past","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"680",1557,"pagehood, and who waited upon the Earl in personal service; second,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"681",1557,"squires of the household, who, having regular hours assigned for","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"682",1557,"exercise in the manual of arms, were relieved from personal service","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"683",1557,"excepting upon especial occasions; and thirdly and lastly, at the head","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"684",1557,"of the whole body of lads, a class called bachelors--young men ranging","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"685",1557,"from eighteen to twenty years of age. This class was supposed to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"686",1557,"exercise a sort of government over the other and younger squires--to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"687",1557,"keep them in order as much as possible, to marshal them upon occasions","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"688",1557,"of importance, to see that their arms and equipments were kept in good","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"689",1557,"order, to call the roll for chapel in the morning, and to see that those","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"690",1557,"not upon duty in the house were present at the daily exercise at arms.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"691",1557,"Orders to the squires were generally transmitted through the bachelors,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"700",1557,"body--a law supported by all the prestige of long-continued usage. At","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"719",1557,"about the grim old man that quelled them, as the trainer with a lash of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2382",1557,"to the far end of the dormitory, where the bachelors were presently","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2383",1557,"clustered together. A few words passed between them, and then the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2384",1557,"thirteen began at once arming themselves, some with wooden clogs,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2434",1557,"matched; Blunt was fully half a head taller than Myles, and was","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2435",1557,"thick-set and close-knit in young manhood. Nothing but Myles's undaunted","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3600",1557,"against the door-post, and laughingly telling how he and some of his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3601",1557,"brother squires had made a figure of straw dressed in men's clothes, and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3639",1557,"that poor Lady Alice uttered a faint shriek, and Lady Anne stopped","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3640",1557,"abruptly, trembling. Then she turned and passed out the farther door of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3641",1557,"the summerhouse, poor little Lady Alice following, holding her tight","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3648",1557,"gone. Myles heard their footsteps growing fainter and fainter, but he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3649",1557,"never raised his eyes. Upon the ground at his feet were four pebbles,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3650",1557,"and he noticed how they almost made a square, and would do so if he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3651",1557,"pushed one of them with his toe, and then it seemed strange to him that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3806",1557,"Yea, I did shamefully, so to resign my lady without speaking one word;","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3808",1557,"matter of late, Francis, and now I come to thee to help me from my evil","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3821",1557,"written and one day the good-natured Gascoyne carried it with him to the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3822",1557,"house, and the opportunity offering, gave it to one of the young ladies","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3834",1557,"thus raised above the others, he came walking down the length of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3835",1557,"room towards him, the wonted hubbub gradually silencing as he advanced","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3836",1557,"and the youngsters turning, staring, and wondering.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3837",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3838",1557,"""My Lord would speak with thee, Myles Falworth,"" said the groom, when he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3849",1557,"Myles's head was in a whirl as he hastily changed his clothes for a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3850",1557,"better suit, Gascoyne helping him. What could the Earl want with him at","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3851",1557,"this hour? He knew in his heart what it was; the interview could concern","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3852",1557,"nothing but the letter that he had sent to Lady Alice that day. As he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3853",1557,"followed the groom through the now dark and silent courts, and across","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3854",1557,"the corner of the great quadrangle, and so to the Earl's house, he tried","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3855",1557,"to brace his failing courage to meet the coming interview. Nevertheless,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3856",1557,"his heart beat tumultuously as he followed the other down the long","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3857",1557,"corridor, lit only by a flaring link set in a wrought-iron bracket. Then","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3858",1557,"his conductor lifted the arras at the door of the bedchamber, whence","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3859",1557,"came the murmuring sound of many voices, and holding it aside, beckoned","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3860",1557,"him to enter, and Myles passed within. At the first, he was conscious","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3861",1557,"of nothing but a crowd of people, and of the brightness of many lighted","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3862",1557,"candles; then he saw that he stood in a great airy room spread with a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3863",1557,"woven mat of rushes. On three sides the walls were hung with tapestry","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3864",1557,"representing hunting and battle scenes, at the farther end, where the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3865",1557,"bed stood, the stone wall of the fourth side was covered with cloth of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3866",1557,"blue, embroidered with silver goshawks. Even now, in the ripe springtime","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3867",1557,"of May, the room was still chilly, and a great fire roared and crackled","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3868",1557,"in the huge gaping mouth of the stone fireplace. Not far from the blaze","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3869",1557,"were clustered the greater part of those present, buzzing in talk, now","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3870",1557,"and then swelled by murmuring laughter. Some of those who knew Myles","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3871",1557,"nodded to him, and two or three spoke to him as he stood waiting, whilst","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3872",1557,"the groom went forward to speak to the Earl; though what they said and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3873",1557,"what he answered, Myles, in his bewilderment and trepidation, hardly","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3874",1557,"knew.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3875",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3876",1557,"As was said before, the livery was the last meal of the day, and was","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3877",1557,"taken in bed. It was a simple repast--a manchette, or small loaf of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3878",1557,"bread of pure white flour, a loaf of household bread, sometimes a lump","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3879",1557,"of cheese, and either a great flagon of ale or of sweet wine, warm","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3880",1557,"and spiced. The Earl was sitting upright in bed, dressed in a furred","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3881",1557,"dressing-gown, and propped up by two cylindrical bolsters of crimson","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3882",1557,"satin. Upon the coverlet, and spread over his knees, was a large wide","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3883",1557,"napkin of linen fringed with silver thread, and on it rested a silver","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3884",1557,"tray containing the bread and some cheese. Two pages and three gentlemen","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3885",1557,"were waiting upon him, and Mad Noll, the jester, stood at the head of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3886",1557,"the bed, now and then jingling his bawble and passing some quaint jest","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3887",1557,"upon the chance of making his master smile. Upon a table near by were","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3888",1557,"some dozen or so waxen tapers struck upon as many spiked candlesticks","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3889",1557,"of silver-gilt, and illuminating that end of the room with their bright","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3890",1557,"twinkling flames. One of the gentlemen was in the act of serving the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3891",1557,"Earl with a goblet of wine, poured from a silver ewer by one of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3892",1557,"squires, as the groom of the chamber came forward and spoke. The Earl,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3893",1557,"taking the goblet, turned his head, and as Myles looked, their eyes met.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3894",1557,"Then the Earl turned away again and raised the cup to his lips, while","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3895",1557,"Myles felt his heart beat more rapidly than ever.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3896",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3897",1557,"But at last the meal was ended, and the Earl washed his hands and his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3898",1557,"mouth and his beard from a silver basin of scented water held by another","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3899",1557,"one of the squires. Then, leaning back against the pillows, he beckoned","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3900",1557,"to Myles.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3901",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3902",1557,"In answer Myles walked forward the length of the room, conscious that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3903",1557,"all eyes were fixed upon him. The Earl said something, and those who","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3904",1557,"stood near drew back as he came forward. Then Myles found himself","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3905",1557,"standing beside the bed, looking down upon the quilted counterpane,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3906",1557,"feeling that the other was gazing fixedly at him.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3907",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3908",1557,"""I sent for thee,"" said the Earl at last, still looking steadily at","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3909",1557,"him, ""because this afternoon came a letter to my hand which thou hadst","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3910",1557,"written to my niece, the Lady Alice. I have it here,"" said he, thrusting","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3911",1557,"his hand under the bolster, ""and have just now finished reading it.""","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3912",1557,"Then, after a moment's pause, whilst he opened the parchment and scanned","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3913",1557,"it again, ""I find no matter of harm in it, but hereafter write no more","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3914",1557,"such."" He spoke entirely without anger, and Myles looked up in wonder.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3915",1557,"""Here, take it,"" said the Earl, folding the letter and tossing it to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3916",1557,"Myles, who instinctively caught it, ""and henceforth trouble thou my","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3918",1557,"wouldst be at some such saucy trick, and I made Alice promise to let me","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3919",1557,"know when it happed. Now, I say, let this be an end of the matter. Dost","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4016",1557,"somewhat like a camp-chair, but made of heavy oaken braces and with a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4133",1557,"was so full of joy and wonder and amazement that it thrilled almost to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4134",1557,"agony. Of course his first thought was of Gascoyne. How he ever found","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4437",1557,"yellow sun of autumn blazing and flaming upon polished helmets and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4440",1557,"young breast with great draughts of the sweet fresh air that came","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4441",1557,"singing across the sunny hill-tops. Sir James Lee, who acted as the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4466",1557,"down upon them from the windows above, or crowded the fronts of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4477",1557,"a plain blue-gray riding-habit, and sitting upon a beautiful white","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4478",1557,"gelding, stood a little in advance of the rest of the party, and he knew","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4479",1557,"that that must be the King. Then Sir James nodded to Myles, and leaping","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4480",1557,"from his horse, flung the reins to one of the attendants. Myles did","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4481",1557,"the like; and then, still following Sir James's lead as he served","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4482",1557,"Lord Mackworth, went forward and held Lord George's stirrup while he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4483",1557,"dismounted. The two noblemen quickly removed each his bascinet, and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4484",1557,"Myles, holding the bridle-rein of Lord George's horse with his left","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4485",1557,"hand, took the helmet in his right, resting it upon his hip.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4486",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4487",1557,"Then the two brothers walked forward bare-headed, the Earl, a little in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4489",1557,"in the armored plates--until it touched the ground. Thereupon the King","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4490",1557,"reached him his hand, and he, rising again, took it, and set it to his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4492",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4496",1557,"Myles could hear nothing, but he could see that a few words of greeting","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4498",1557,"knight who stood just behind him and a little in advance of the others","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4499",1557,"of the troop. In answer, the knight rode forward; the King spoke a few","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4500",1557,"words of introduction, and the stranger, ceremoniously drawing off his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4501",1557,"right gauntlet, clasped the hand, first of the Earl, and then of Lord","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4502",1557,"George. Myles knew that he must be the great Comte de Vermoise, of whom","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4505",1557,"A few moments of conversation followed, and then the King bowed","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4506",1557,"slightly. The French nobleman instantly reined back his horse, an order","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4507",1557,"was given, and then the whole company moved forward, the two brothers","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4508",1557,"walking upon either side of the King, the Earl lightly touching the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4513",1557,"the other party. As the King reached the head of the troop, another halt","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4514",1557,"followed while he spoke a few courteous words of greeting to some of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4523",1557,"except for a mustache and tuft covering lips and chin. Somehow he felt","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4524",1557,"a deep disappointment. He had expected to see something lion-like,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4525",1557,"something regal, and, after all, the great King Henry was commonplace,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4526",1557,"fat, unwholesome-looking. It came to him with a sort of a shock that,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4539",1557,"walking slowly across the Armory Court wrapped in deep conversation, and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4549",1557,"flight of stone steps, and whistling, beckoned one of the smaller pages","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4550",1557,"to him. He gave a short order that sent the little fellow flying on some","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4551",1557,"mission. In the course of a few minutes he returned, hurrying across","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4552",1557,"the stony court with Myles Falworth, who presently entered Sir James's","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4554",1557,"excitement reached its height of fever-heat. What did it all mean? The","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4555",1557,"air was filled with a thousand vague, wild rumors--but the very wildest","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4561",1557,"the seat that Sir James Lee usually occupied; Lord George half sat, half","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4562",1557,"leaned in the window-place. Sir James stood with his back to the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4679",1557,"he found himself in a grassy angle below the end of the south stable; a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4681",1557,"no one was near, and he flung himself at length, burying his face in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4682",1557,"his arms. How long he lay there he did not know, but suddenly some","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4683",1557,"one touched him upon the shoulder, and he sprang up quickly. It was","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4728",1557,"At two o'clock Myles went to Lord George's apartments, and there his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4729",1557,"friend and patron dressed him out in a costume better fitted for the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4730",1557,"ceremony of presentation--a fur-trimmed jacket of green brocaded velvet","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4731",1557,"embroidered with golden thread, a black velvet hood-cap rolled like a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4732",1557,"turban and with a jewel in the front, a pair of crimson hose, and a pair","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4733",1557,"of black velvet shoes trimmed and stitched with gold-thread. Myles had","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4734",1557,"never worn such splendid clothes in his life before, and he could not","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4735",1557,"but feel that they became him well.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4736",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4737",1557,"""Sir,"" said he, as he looked down at himself, ""sure it is not lawful for","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4739",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4740",1557,"In those days there was a law, known as a sumptuary law, which regulated","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4741",1557,"by statute the clothes that each class of people were privileged to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4742",1557,"wear. It was, as Myles said, against the law for him to wear such","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4743",1557,"garments as those in which he was clad--either velvet, crimson stuff,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4744",1557,"fur or silver or gold embroidery--nevertheless such a solemn ceremony as","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4745",1557,"presentation to the King excused the temporary overstepping of the law,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4746",1557,"and so Lord George told him. As he laid his hand upon the lad's shoulder","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4747",1557,"and held him off at arm's-length, he added, ""And I pledge thee my word,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4753",1557,"Lord George laughed; and then giving him a shake, let go his shoulder.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4765",1557,"protege. As he laid his hand upon the latch of the wicket he paused for","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4766",1557,"a moment and turned.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4767",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4768",1557,"""Myles,"" said he, in a low voice, ""thou art a thoughtful and cautious","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4770",1557,"speak his name or betray that thou art his son."" Then he opened the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4775",1557,"weight of such a presentation. He hardly knew what he was doing as","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4776",1557,"Lord George led him to where the King stood, a little apart from","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4777",1557,"the attendants, with the Earl and the Comte de Vermoise. Even in his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4778",1557,"confusion he knew enough to kneel, and somehow his honest, modest","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4779",1557,"diffidence became the young fellow very well. He was not awkward, for","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4780",1557,"one so healthful in mind and body as he could not bear himself very ill,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4781",1557,"and he felt the assurance that in Lord George he had a kind friend at","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4782",1557,"his side, and one well used to court ceremonies to lend him countenance.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4783",1557,"Then there is something always pleasing in frank, modest manliness such","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4784",1557,"as was stamped on Myles's handsome, sturdy face. No doubt the King's","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4785",1557,"heart warmed towards the fledgling warrior kneeling in the pathway","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4786",1557,"before him. He smiled very kindly as he gave the lad his hand to kiss,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4787",1557,"and that ceremony done, held fast to the hard, brown, sinewy fist of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4813",1557,"a little distance. He came instantly forward in answer to the summons,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4814",1557,"and the King introduced the two to one another. As each took the other","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4815",1557,"formally by the hand, he measured his opponent hastily, body and limb,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4816",1557,"and perhaps each thought that he had never seen a stronger, stouter,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5033",1557,"dazzling brightness, the breastplate covered with a juppon of white","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5037",1557,"high-vaulted room, the whole multitude broke forth into a humming buzz","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5038",1557,"of applause. Then a sudden clapping of hands began near the door-way,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5039",1557,"ran down through the length of the room, and was taken up by all with","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5048",1557,"him, upon the dais whereon sat the King, with the Earl of Mackworth","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5049",1557,"standing at his right hand, the Comte de Vermoise upon the left, and the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5050",1557,"others ranged around and behind the throne. It was with the same tense","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5051",1557,"feeling of dreamy unreality that Myles walked slowly up the length of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5052",1557,"the hall, measuring his steps by those of Gascoyne. Suddenly he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5053",1557,"felt Lord George Beaumont touch him lightly upon the arm, and almost","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5054",1557,"instinctively he stopped short--he was standing just before the covered","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5055",1557,"steps of the throne.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5056",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5057",1557,"He saw Gascoyne mount to the third step, stop short, kneel, and offer","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5058",1557,"the sword and the spurs he carried to the King, who took the weapon","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5059",1557,"and laid it across his knees. Then the squire bowed low, and walking","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5060",1557,"backward withdrew to one side, leaving Myles standing alone facing the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5061",1557,"throne. The King unlocked the spur chains from the sword-hilt, and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5062",1557,"then, holding the gilt spurs in his hand for a moment, he looked Myles","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5063",1557,"straight in the eyes and smiled. Then he turned, and gave one of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5064",1557,"spurs to the Earl of Mackworth.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5065",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5066",1557,"The Earl took it with a low bow, turned, and came slowly down the steps","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5067",1557,"to where Myles stood. Kneeling upon one knee, and placing Myles's foot","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5068",1557,"upon the other, Lord Mackworth set the spur in its place and latched the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5069",1557,"chain over the instep. He drew the sign of the cross upon Myles's bended","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5070",1557,"knee, set the foot back upon the ground, rose with slow dignity, and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5071",1557,"bowing to the King, drew a little to one side.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5072",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5073",1557,"As soon as the Earl had fulfilled his office the King gave the second","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5074",1557,"spur to the Comte de Vermoise, who set it to Myles's other foot with the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5075",1557,"same ceremony that the Earl had observed, withdrawing as he had done to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5076",1557,"one side.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5078",1557,"An instant pause of motionless silence followed, and then the King","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5079",1557,"slowly arose, and began deliberately to unwind the belt from around the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5080",1557,"scabbard of the sword he held. As soon as he stood, the Earl and the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5081",1557,"Count advanced, and taking Myles by either hand, led him forward and up","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5082",1557,"the steps of the dais to the platform above. As they drew a little to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5083",1557,"one side, the King stooped and buckled the sword-belt around Myles's","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5084",1557,"waist, then, rising again, lifted his hand and struck him upon the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5085",1557,"shoulder, crying, in a loud voice.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5086",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5098",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5099",1557,"It was the custom to conclude the ceremonies of the bestowal of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5100",1557,"knighthood by a grand feast given in honor of the newly-created knight.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5101",1557,"But in Myles's instance the feast was dispensed with. The Earl of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5102",1557,"Mackworth had planned that Myles might be created a Knight of the Bath","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5103",1557,"with all possible pomp and ceremony; that his personality might be","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5104",1557,"most favorably impressed upon the King; that he might be so honorably","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5105",1557,"knighted as to make him the peer of any who wore spurs in all England;","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5106",1557,"and, finally, that he might celebrate his new honors by jousting with","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5107",1557,"some knight of high fame and approved valor. All these desiderata chance","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5108",1557,"had fulfilled in the visit of the King to Devlen.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5109",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5110",1557,"As the Earl had said to Myles, he would rather have waited a little","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5111",1557,"while longer until the lad was riper in years and experience, but the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5112",1557,"opportunity was not to be lost. Young as he was, Myles must take","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5113",1557,"his chances against the years and grim experience of the Sieur de la","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5114",1557,"Montaigne. But it was also a part of the Earl's purpose that the King","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5115",1557,"and Myles should not be brought too intimately together just at that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5116",1557,"time. Though every particular of circumstance should be fulfilled in the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5117",1557,"ceremony, it would have been ruination to the Earl's plans to have the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5118",1557,"knowledge come prematurely to the King that Myles was the son of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5119",1557,"the attainted Lord Falworth. The Earl knew that Myles was a shrewd,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5120",1557,"coolheaded lad; but the King had already hinted that the name was","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5121",1557,"familiar to his ears, and a single hasty answer or unguarded speech upon","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5122",1557,"the young knight's part might awaken him to a full knowledge. Such a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5123",1557,"mishap was, of all things, to be avoided just then, for, thanks to the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5124",1557,"machinations of that enemy of his father of whom Myles had heard so","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5125",1557,"much, and was soon to hear more, the King had always retained and still","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5126",1557,"held a bitter and rancorous enmity against the unfortunate nobleman.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5127",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5128",1557,"It was no very difficult matter for the Earl to divert the King's","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5129",1557,"attention from the matter of the feast. His Majesty was very intent","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5130",1557,"just then upon supplying a quota of troops to the Dauphin, and the chief","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5131",1557,"object of his visit to Devlen was to open negotiations with the Earl","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5132",1557,"looking to that end. He was interested--much interested in Myles and in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5133",1557,"the coming jousting in which the young warrior was to prove himself, but","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5134",1557,"he was interested in it by way of a relaxation from the other and more","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5135",1557,"engrossing matter. So, though he made some passing and half preoccupied","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5136",1557,"inquiry about the feast he was easily satisfied with the Earl's reasons","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5137",1557,"for not holding it: which were that he had arranged a consultation for","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5138",1557,"that morning in regard to the troops for the Dauphin, to which meeting","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5139",1557,"he had summoned a number of his own more important dependent nobles,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5140",1557,"that the King himself needed repose and the hour or so of rest that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5141",1557,"his barber-surgeon had ordered him to take after his mid-day meal; that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5142",1557,"Father Thomas had laid upon Myles a petty penance--that for the first","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5143",1557,"three days of his knighthood he should eat his meals without meat and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5144",1557,"in his own apartment--and various other reasons equally good and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5145",1557,"sufficient. So the King was satisfied, and the feast was dispensed with.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5146",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5147",1557,"The next morning had been set for the jousting, and all that day the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5148",1557,"workmen were busy erecting the lists in the great quadrangle upon which,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5149",1557,"as was said before, looked the main buildings of the castle. The windows","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5150",1557,"of Myles's apartment opened directly upon the bustling scene--the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5151",1557,"carpenters hammering and sawing, the upholsterers snipping, cutting,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5152",1557,"and tacking. Myles and Gascoyne stood gazing out from the open casement,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5153",1557,"with their arms lying across one another's shoulders in the old boyhood","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5154",1557,"fashion, and Myles felt his heart shrink with a sudden tight pang as","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5155",1557,"the realization came sharply and vividly upon him that all these","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5156",1557,"preparations were being made for him, and that the next day he should,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5157",1557,"with almost the certainty of death, meet either glory or failure under","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5158",1557,"the eyes not only of all the greater and lesser castle folk, but of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5159",1557,"King himself and noble strangers critically used to deeds of chivalry","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5160",1557,"and prowess. Perhaps he had never fully realized the magnitude of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5161",1557,"reality before. In that tight pang at his heart he drew a deep breath,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5162",1557,"almost a sigh. Gascoyne turned his head abruptly, and looked at his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5163",1557,"friend, but he did not ask the cause of the sigh. No doubt the same","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5164",1557,"thoughts that were in Myles's mind were in his also.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5165",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5166",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5167",1557,"It was towards the latter part of the afternoon that a message came from","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5168",1557,"the Earl, bidding Myles attend him in his private closet. After Myles","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5169",1557,"had bowed and kissed his lordship's hand, the Earl motioned him to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5170",1557,"take a seat, telling him that he had some final words to say that might","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5171",1557,"occupy a considerable time. He talked to the young man for about half","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5172",1557,"an hour in his quiet, measured voice, only now and then showing a little","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5173",1557,"agitation by rising and walking up and down the room for a turn or two.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5174",1557,"Very many things were disclosed in that talk that had caused Myles","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5175",1557,"long hours of brooding thought, for the Earl spoke freely, and without","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5176",1557,"concealment to him concerning his father and the fortunes of the house","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5177",1557,"of Falworth.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5178",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5179",1557,"Myles had surmised many things, but it was not until then that he knew","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5180",1557,"for a certainty who was his father's malignant and powerful enemy--that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5181",1557,"it was the great Earl of Alban, the rival and bitter enemy of the Earl","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5182",1557,"of Mackworth. It was not until then that he knew that the present Earl","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5183",1557,"of Alban was the Lord Brookhurst, who had killed Sir John Dale in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5184",1557,"the anteroom at Falworth Castle that morning so long ago in his early","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5185",1557,"childhood. It was not until then that he knew all the circumstances of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5186",1557,"his father's blindness; that he had been overthrown in the melee at the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5187",1557,"great tournament at York, and that that same Lord Brookhurst had ridden","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5188",1557,"his iron-shod war-horse twice over his enemy's prostrate body before his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5189",1557,"squire could draw him from the press, and had then and there given him","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5190",1557,"the wound from which he afterwards went blind. The Earl swore to Myles","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5191",1557,"that Lord Brookhurst had done what he did wilfully, and had afterwards","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5192",1557,"boasted of it. Then, with some hesitation, he told Myles the reason","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5193",1557,"of Lord Brookhurst's enmity, and that it had arisen on account of Lady","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5194",1557,"Falworth, whom he had one time sought in marriage, and that he had sworn","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5195",1557,"vengeance against the man who had won her.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5196",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5197",1557,"Piece by piece the Earl of Mackworth recounted every circumstance and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5198",1557,"detail of the revenge that the blind man's enemy had afterwards","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5199",1557,"wreaked upon him. He told Myles how, when his father was attainted","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5200",1557,"of high-treason, and his estates forfeited to the crown, the King had","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5201",1557,"granted the barony of Easterbridge to the then newly-created Earl of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5202",1557,"Alban in spite of all the efforts of Lord Falworth's friends to the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5203",1557,"contrary; that when he himself had come out from an audience with the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5204",1557,"King, with others of his father's friends, the Earl of Alban had boasted","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5205",1557,"in the anteroom, in a loud voice, evidently intended for them all to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5206",1557,"hear, that now that he had Falworth's fat lands, he would never rest","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5207",1557,"till he had hunted the blind man out from his hiding, and brought his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5208",1557,"head to the block.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5209",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5210",1557,"""Ever since then,"" said the Earl of Mackworth ""he hath been striving by","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5211",1557,"every means to discover thy father's place of concealment. Some time,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5212",1557,"haply, he may find it, and then--""","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5213",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5214",1557,"Myles had felt for a long time that he was being moulded and shaped, and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5215",1557,"that the Earl of Mackworth's was the hand that was making him what he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5216",1557,"was growing to be; but he had never realized how great were the things","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5217",1557,"expected of him should he pass the first great test, and show himself","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5218",1557,"what his friends hoped to see him. Now he knew that all were looking","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5219",1557,"upon him to act, sometime, as his father's champion, and when that time","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5220",1557,"should come, to challenge the Earl of Alban to the ordeal of single","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5221",1557,"combat, to purge his father's name of treason, to restore him to his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5222",1557,"rank, and to set the house of Falworth where it stood before misfortune","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5223",1557,"fell upon it.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5224",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5225",1557,"But it was not alone concerning his and his father's affairs that the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5226",1557,"Earl of Mackworth talked to Myles. He told him that the Earl of Alban","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5227",1557,"was the Earl of Mackworth's enemy also; that in his younger days he had","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5228",1557,"helped Lord Falworth, who was his kinsman, to win his wife, and that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5229",1557,"then, Lord Brookhurst had sworn to compass his ruin as he had sworn","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5230",1557,"to compass the ruin of his friend. He told Myles how, now that Lord","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5231",1557,"Brookhurst was grown to be Earl of Alban, and great and powerful, he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5232",1557,"was forever plotting against him, and showed Myles how, if Lord Falworth","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5234",1557,"suffer for aiding and abetting him. Then it dawned upon Myles that the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5235",1557,"Earl looked to him to champion the house of Beaumont as well as that of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5236",1557,"Falworth.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5242",1557,"hard for such a small matter as that. I have had the King, unknown to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5243",1557,"himself, so knight thee that thou mayst be the peer of Alban himself,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5244",1557,"and now I would have thee to hold thine own with the Sieur de la","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5245",1557,"Montaigne, to try whether thou be'st Alban's match, and to approve","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5249",1557,"vile Alban are not yet ripe. But such a chance of the King coming hither","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5250",1557,"haps not often. And then I am glad of this much--that a good occasion","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5251",1557,"offers to get thee presently away from England. I would have thee out","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5252",1557,"of the King's sight so soon as may be after this jousting. He taketh","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5253",1557,"a liking to thee, and I fear me lest he should inquire more nearly","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5254",1557,"concerning thee and so all be discovered and spoiled. My brother George","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5304",1557,"Earl's and the Countess's apartments, and was used but little. During","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5305",1557,"that time he stood looking absently out of the open casement into the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5406",1557,"of the castle, than which, level and smooth as a floor, no more fitting","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5407",1557,"place could be chosen. The course was of the usual size--sixty paces","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5408",1557,"long--and separated along its whole length by a barrier about five feet","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5409",1557,"high. Upon the west side of the course and about twenty paces distant","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5410",1557,"from it, a scaffolding had been built facing towards the east so as to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5411",1557,"avoid the glare of the afternoon sun. In the centre was a raised dais,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5412",1557,"hung round with cloth of blue embroidered with lions rampant. Upon the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5584",1557,"ceaseless restlessness, and in the centre of all, his opponent, sitting","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5589",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5590",1557,"Upon that motionless figure his sight gradually centred with every","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5592",1557,"given that was to bring him either glory or shame from that iron statue.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5595",1557,"his huge helm. Then with a shake he settled himself more firmly in his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5596",1557,"saddle, slowly raised his spear point until the shaft reached the exact","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5597",1557,"angle, and there suffered it to rest motionless. There was a moment of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5598",1557,"dead, tense, breathless pause, then he rather felt than saw the Marshal","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5599",1557,"raise his baton. He gathered himself together, and the next moment a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5600",1557,"bugle sounded loud and clear. In one blinding rush he drove his spurs","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5607",1557,"together. He gripped his saddle with his knees, clutched the stirrup","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5708",1557,"delivered upon the helm was of all others the most difficult for the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5709",1557,"recipient to recover from, but then a blow upon the helm was not one","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5710",1557,"time in fifty perfectly given. The huge cylindrical tilting helm was so","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5711",1557,"constructed in front as to slope at an angle in all directions to one","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5712",1557,"point. That point was the centre of a cross formed by two iron bands","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5715",1557,"this cross was a little flattened surface where the bands were riveted","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5716",1557,"together, and it was upon that minute point that the blow must be given","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5727",1557,"breathless pause. Myles was surprised at his own coolness; every nervous","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5728",1557,"tremor was gone. Before, he had been conscious of the critical multitude","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5729",1557,"looking down upon him; now it was a conflict of man to man, and such a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5734",1557,"breathless silence fell for the moment or two that the knights stood in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5741",1557,"horse's flanks. Again he saw the iron figure of his opponent rushing","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5742",1557,"nearer, nearer, nearer. He centred, with a straining intensity, every","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5745",1557,"tremendous shock which he knew must meet him, and then in a flash","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5746",1557,"dropped lance point straight and true. The next instant there was a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5747",1557,"deafening stunning crash--a crash like the stroke of a thunder-bolt.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5748",1557,"There was a dazzling blaze of blinding light, and a myriad sparks danced","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5750",1557,"under him with the recoil, and hardly knowing what he did, he drove","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5751",1557,"his spurs deep into its sides with a shout. At the same moment there","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5752",1557,"resounded in his ears a crashing rattle and clatter, he knew not of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5753",1557,"what, and then, as his horse recovered and sprang forward, and as the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5754",1557,"stunning bewilderment passed, he found that his helmet had been","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5755",1557,"struck off. He heard a great shout arise from all, and thought, with a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5756",1557,"sickening, bitter disappointment, that it was because he had lost. At","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5757",1557,"the farther end of the course he turned his horse, and then his heart","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5855",1557,"he had seen them since, four years ago, he had quitted the low, narrow,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5856",1557,"white-walled farmhouse for the castle of the great Earl of Mackworth. He","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5857",1557,"had never appreciated before how low and narrow and poor the farm-house","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5858",1557,"was. Now, with his eyes trained to the bigness of Devlen Castle,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5859",1557,"he looked around him with wonder and pity at his father's humble","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5860",1557,"surroundings. He realized as he never else could have realized how great","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5861",1557,"was the fall in fortune that had cast the house of Falworth down from","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5862",1557,"its rightful station to such a level as that upon which it now rested.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5863",1557,"And at the same time that he thus recognized how poor was their lot, how","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5864",1557,"dependent upon the charity of others, he also recognized how generous","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5865",1557,"was the friendship of Prior Edward, who perilled his own safety so","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5866",1557,"greatly in affording the family of the attainted Lord an asylum in its","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5869",1557,"Myles paid many visits to the gentle old priest during those two weeks'","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5870",1557,"visit, and had many long and serious talks with him. One warm bright","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5871",1557,"afternoon, as he and the old man walked together in the priory garden,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5872",1557,"after a game or two of draughts, the young knight talked more freely and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5873",1557,"openly of his plans, his hopes, his ambitions, than perhaps he had","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5874",1557,"ever done. He told the old man all that the Earl had disclosed to him","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5875",1557,"concerning the fallen fortunes of his father's house, and of how all","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5876",1557,"who knew those circumstances looked to him to set the family in its old","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5878",1557,"already knew--things of which the Earl either did not know, or did not","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5879",1557,"choose to speak. He told the young man, among other matters, the reason","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5880",1557,"of the bitter and lasting enmity that the King felt for the blind","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5881",1557,"nobleman: that Lord Falworth had been one of King Richard's council in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5882",1557,"times past; that it was not a little owing to him that King Henry, when","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5883",1557,"Earl of Derby, had been banished from England, and that though he","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5884",1557,"was then living in the retirement of private life, he bitterly and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5885",1557,"steadfastly opposed King Richard's abdication. He told Myles that at the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5886",1557,"time when Sir John Dale found shelter at Falworth Castle, vengeance was","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5893",1557,"against such an ardent opponent as the blind Lord had shown himself to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6532",1557,"It was not until the end of July that the High Court of Chivalry","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6533",1557,"rendered its judgment. There were many unusual points in the case, some","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6534",1557,"of which bore heavily against Lord Falworth, some of which were in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6535",1557,"his favor. He was very ably defended by the lawyers whom the Earl","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6536",1557,"of Mackworth had engaged upon his side; nevertheless, under ordinary","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6537",1557,"circumstances, the judgment, no doubt, would have been quickly rendered","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6538",1557,"against him. As it was, however, the circumstances were not ordinary,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6539",1557,"and it was rendered in his favor. The Court besought the King to grant","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6540",1557,"the ordeal by battle, to accept Lord Falworth's champion, and to appoint","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6542",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6543",1557,"The decision must have been a most bitter, galling one for the sick","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6545",1557,"Falworth in his time of power had been an unrelenting and fearless","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6546",1557,"opponent, and his Majesty who, like most generous men, could on","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6547",1557,"occasions be very cruel and intolerant, had never forgiven him. He had","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6548",1557,"steadily thrown the might of his influence with the Court against the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6549",1557,"Falworths' case, but that influence was no longer all-powerful for good","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6550",1557,"or ill. He was failing in health, and it could only be a matter of a few","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6551",1557,"years, probably of only a few months, before his successor sat upon the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6558",1557,"counter-plotting, scheming and counter-scheming, the case was decided in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6559",1557,"Lord Falworth's favor. The knowledge of the ultimate result was known","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6560",1557,"to the Prince of Wales's circle almost a week before it was finally","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6561",1557,"decided. Indeed, the Earl of Mackworth had made pretty sure of that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6562",1557,"result before he had summoned Myles from France, but upon the King it","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6563",1557,"fell like the shock of a sudden blow. All that day he kept himself in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6564",1557,"moody seclusion, nursing his silent, bitter anger, and making only","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6565",1557,"one outbreak, in which he swore by the Holy Rood that should Myles be","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6566",1557,"worsted in the encounter, he would not take the battle into his own","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6570",1557,"secretly inclined to the Prince of Wales's faction, had repeated this","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6571",1557,"speech at Scotland Yard, and the Prince had said, ""That meaneth, Myles,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6576",1557,"It was not until nearly a fortnight after the decision of the Court of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6586",1557,"The lists were laid out in the usual form. The true or principal list in","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6587",1557,"which the combatants were to engage was sixty yards long and forty yards","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6588",1557,"wide; this rectangular space being surrounded by a fence about six feet","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6589",1557,"high, painted vermilion. Between the fence and the stand where the King","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6598",1557,"Alban and his followers, who were just quitting the lists, which they","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6599",1557,"also were in the habit of visiting nearly every day. As the two parties","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6895",1557,"clashing and clamor of blows, now and then beating intermittently, now","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6949",1557,"war-horse, facing his powerful young enemy at about twelve paces","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6950",1557,"distant. He sat as still as a rock, holding his gisarm poised in front","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6952",1557,"and each time with the point of the sword, so much more dangerous than a","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6953",1557,"direct cut with the weapon. One wound was beneath his armor, and no one","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6955",1557,"of the epauhere, and from it a finger's-breadth of blood ran straight","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6956",1557,"down his side and over the housings of his horse. From without, the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6958",1557,"who knows what consuming blasts of hate, rage, and despair swept his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6968",1557,"Then in an instant, as quick as a flash, his enemy spurred straight upon","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6970",1557,"which he threw in one final effort all the strength of hate, of fury,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6971",1557,"and of despair. Myles whirled his horse backward, warding the blow with","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6972",1557,"his shield as he did so. The blade glanced from the smooth face of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6973",1557,"shield, and, whether by mistake or not, fell straight and true, and with","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6974",1557,"almost undiminished force, upon the neck of Myles's war-horse, and just","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6975",1557,"behind the ears. The animal staggered forward, and then fell upon its","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6976",1557,"knees, and at the same instant the other, as though by the impetus of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6977",1557,"the rush, dashed full upon it with all the momentum lent by the weight","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6978",1557,"of iron it carried. The shock was irresistible, and the stunned and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6979",1557,"wounded horse was flung upon the ground, rolling over and over. As his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6980",1557,"horse fell, Myles wrenched one of his feet out of the stirrup; the other","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6981",1557,"caught for an instant, and he was flung headlong with stunning violence,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6982",1557,"his armor crashing as he fell. In the cloud of dust that arose no","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6983",1557,"one could see just what happened, but that what was done was done","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6984",1557,"deliberately no one doubted. The earl, at once checking and spurring","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6985",1557,"his foaming charger, drove the iron-shod war-horse directly over Myles's","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6986",1557,"prostrate body. Then, checking him fiercely with the curb, reined him","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6987",1557,"back, the hoofs clashing and crashing, over the figure beneath. So","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6988",1557,"he had ridden over the father at York, and so he rode over the son at","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"6990",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6991",1557,"Myles, as he lay prostrate and half stunned by his fall, had seen his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6992",1557,"enemy thus driving his rearing horse down upon him, but was not able to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6993",1557,"defend himself. A fallen knight in full armor was utterly powerless to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6994",1557,"rise without assistance; Myles lay helpless in the clutch of the very","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6995",1557,"iron that was his defence. He closed his eyes involuntarily, and then","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6996",1557,"horse and rider were upon him. There was a deafening, sparkling crash,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"6997",1557,"a glimmering faintness, then another crash as the horse was reined","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7000",1557,"In a moment, upon the scaffolding all was a tumult of uproar and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7001",1557,"confusion, shouting and gesticulation; only the King sat calm, sullen,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7002",1557,"impassive. The Earl wheeled his horse and sat for a moment or two as","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7003",1557,"though to make quite sure that he knew the King's mind. The blow that","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7004",1557,"had been given was foul, unknightly, but the King gave no sign either of","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7005",1557,"acquiescence or rebuke; he had willed that Myles was to die.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7006",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7007",1557,"Then the Earl turned again, and rode deliberately up to his prostrate","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7012",1557,"for one last mortal blow--pitiless, merciless.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7013",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7014",1557,"The sight of that looming peril brought back Myles's wandering senses","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7015",1557,"like a flash of lightning. He flung up his shield, and met the blow even","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7016",1557,"as it descended, turning it aside. It only protracted the end.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7017",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7018",1557,"Once more the Earl of Alban raised the gisarm, swinging it twice around","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7020",1557,"blow fell upon the shoulder-piece, biting through the steel plate and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7021",1557,"leathern jack beneath even to the bone. Then Myles covered his head with","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7022",1557,"his shield as a last protecting chance for life.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7023",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7024",1557,"For the third time the Earl swung the blade flashing, and then it fell,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7025",1557,"straight and true, upon the defenceless body, just below the left arm,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7026",1557,"biting deep through the armor plates. For an instant the blade stuck","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7027",1557,"fast, and that instant was Myles's salvation. Under the agony of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7028",1557,"blow he gave a muffled cry, and almost instinctively grasped the shaft","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7029",1557,"of the weapon with both hands. Had the Earl let go his end of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7030",1557,"weapon, he would have won the battle at his leisure and most easily; as","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7031",1557,"it was, he struggled violently to wrench the gisarm away from Myles. In","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7032",1557,"that short, fierce struggle Myles was dragged to his knees, and then,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7033",1557,"still holding the weapon with one hand, he clutched the trappings of the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7034",1557,"Earl's horse with the other. The next moment he was upon his feet. The","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7035",1557,"other struggled to thrust him away, but Myles, letting go the gisarm,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7036",1557,"which he held with his left hand, clutched him tightly by the sword-belt","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7037",1557,"in the intense, vise-like grip of despair. In vain the Earl strove to","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7038",1557,"beat him loose with the shaft of the gisarm, in vain he spurred and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7039",1557,"reared his horse to shake him off; Myles held him tight, in spite of all","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7041",1557,"","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7042",1557,"He felt neither the streaming blood nor the throbbing agony of his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7043",1557,"wounds; every faculty of soul, mind, body, every power of life, was","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7044",1557,"centered in one intense, burning effort. He neither felt, thought, nor","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7045",1557,"reasoned, but clutching, with the blindness of instinct, the heavy,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7046",1557,"spiked, iron-headed mace that hung at the Earl's saddle-bow, he gave it","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7047",1557,"one tremendous wrench that snapped the plaited leathern thongs that held","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7048",1557,"it as though they were skeins of thread. Then, grinding his teeth as","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7049",1557,"with a spasm, he struck as he had never struck before--once, twice,","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7050",1557,"thrice full upon the front of the helmet. Crash! crash! And then, even","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7051",1557,"as the Earl toppled sidelong, crash! And the iron plates split and","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7052",1557,"crackled under the third blow. Myles had one flashing glimpse of an","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7053",1557,"awful face, and then the saddle was empty.","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7057",1557,"staining the ground upon which he stood. Still he held tightly to the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7058",1557,"saddle-bow of the fallen man's horse until, through his glimmering","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7059",1557,"sight, he saw the Marshal, the Lieutenant, and the attendants gather","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7060",1557,"around him. He heard the Marshal ask him, in a voice that sounded faint","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7061",1557,"and distant, if he was dangerously wounded. He did not answer, and one","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7062",1557,"of the attendants, leaping from his horse, opened the umbril of his","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7067",1557,"his hold upon the horse, he started blindly across the lists towards the","Men of Iron","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
