"16",1635,"only, and perhaps a sufficient, proof of its genuineness. The plan is","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"18",1635,"between the irony of Socrates and the transparent vanity and childlike","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"19",1635,"enthusiasm of the rhapsode Ion. The theme of the Dialogue may possibly","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"20",1635,"have been suggested by the passage of Xenophon's Memorabilia in which","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"21",1635,"the rhapsodists are described by Euthydemus as 'very precise about the","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"25",1635,"Ion the rhapsode has just come to Athens; he has been exhibiting in","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"26",1635,"Epidaurus at the festival of Asclepius, and is intending to exhibit","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"27",1635,"at the festival of the Panathenaea. Socrates admires and envies the","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"28",1635,"rhapsode's art; for he is always well dressed and in good company--in","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"29",1635,"the company of good poets and of Homer, who is the prince of them. In","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"30",1635,"the course of conversation the admission is elicited from Ion that his","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"31",1635,"skill is restricted to Homer, and that he knows nothing of inferior","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"32",1635,"poets, such as Hesiod and Archilochus;--he brightens up and is wide","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"33",1635,"awake when Homer is being recited, but is apt to go to sleep at the","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"34",1635,"recitations of any other poet. 'And yet, surely, he who knows the","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"35",1635,"superior ought to know the inferior also;--he who can judge of the good","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"36",1635,"speaker is able to judge of the bad. And poetry is a whole; and he","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"37",1635,"who judges of poetry by rules of art ought to be able to judge of","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"38",1635,"all poetry.' This is confirmed by the analogy of sculpture, painting,","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"39",1635,"flute-playing, and the other arts. The argument is at last brought home","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"40",1635,"to the mind of Ion, who asks how this contradiction is to be solved. The","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"41",1635,"solution given by Socrates is as follows:--","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"42",1635,"","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"43",1635,"The rhapsode is not guided by rules of art, but is an inspired person","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"44",1635,"who derives a mysterious power from the poet; and the poet, in like","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"45",1635,"manner, is inspired by the God. The poets and their interpreters may be","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"46",1635,"compared to a chain of magnetic rings suspended from one another, and","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"47",1635,"from a magnet. The magnet is the Muse, and the ring which immediately","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"48",1635,"follows is the poet himself; from him are suspended other poets; there","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"49",1635,"is also a chain of rhapsodes and actors, who also hang from the Muses,","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"50",1635,"but are let down at the side; and the last ring of all is the spectator.","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"51",1635,"The poet is the inspired interpreter of the God, and this is the reason","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"52",1635,"why some poets, like Homer, are restricted to a single theme, or,","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"53",1635,"like Tynnichus, are famous for a single poem; and the rhapsode is","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"54",1635,"the inspired interpreter of the poet, and for a similar reason some","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"56",1635,"","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"57",1635,"Ion is delighted at the notion of being inspired, and acknowledges that","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"58",1635,"he is beside himself when he is performing;--his eyes rain tears and his","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"59",1635,"hair stands on end. Socrates is of opinion that a man must be mad who","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"60",1635,"behaves in this way at a festival when he is surrounded by his friends","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"61",1635,"and there is nothing to trouble him. Ion is confident that Socrates","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"62",1635,"would never think him mad if he could only hear his embellishments","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"63",1635,"of Homer. Socrates asks whether he can speak well about everything","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"64",1635,"in Homer. 'Yes, indeed he can.' 'What about things of which he has no","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"65",1635,"knowledge?' Ion answers that he can interpret anything in Homer. But,","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"66",1635,"rejoins Socrates, when Homer speaks of the arts, as for example, of","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"67",1635,"chariot-driving, or of medicine, or of prophecy, or of navigation--will","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"68",1635,"he, or will the charioteer or physician or prophet or pilot be the","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"69",1635,"better judge? Ion is compelled to admit that every man will judge of","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"70",1635,"his own particular art better than the rhapsode. He still maintains,","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"71",1635,"however, that he understands the art of the general as well as any one.","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"72",1635,"'Then why in this city of Athens, in which men of merit are always being","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"73",1635,"sought after, is he not at once appointed a general?' Ion replies that","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"74",1635,"he is a foreigner, and the Athenians and Spartans will not appoint a","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"75",1635,"foreigner to be their general. 'No, that is not the real reason; there","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"76",1635,"are many examples to the contrary. But Ion has long been playing tricks","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"77",1635,"with the argument; like Proteus, he transforms himself into a variety of","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"78",1635,"shapes, and is at last about to run away in the disguise of a general.","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"79",1635,"Would he rather be regarded as inspired or dishonest?' Ion, who has no","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"105",1635,"Like the Statesmen in the Meno, they have a divine instinct, but they","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"106",1635,"are narrow and confused; they do not attain to the clearness of ideas,","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"

"123",1635,"Yet here, as in the Republic, Socrates shows a sympathy with the poetic","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
"124",1635,"nature. Also, the manner in which Ion is affected by his own recitations","Ion","Plato","Philosophy","en"
