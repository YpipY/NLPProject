"220",164,"from one extreme to the other.  That there really was something could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"243",164,"in these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"981",164,"not abate--but suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1245",164,"This unexpected fall so stunned me that I have no clear recollection of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1246",164,"my sensations at the time.  I was at first drawn down to a depth of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1249",164,"plunge I did not lose my presence of mind.  Two vigorous strokes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1250",164,"brought me to the surface of the water.  My first care was to look for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1251",164,"the frigate.  Had the crew seen me disappear?  Had the Abraham Lincoln","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1254",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1255",164,"The darkness was intense.  I caught a glimpse of a black mass","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1310",164,"Conseil's imperturbable coolness set me up again.  I swam more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1311",164,"vigorously; but, cramped by my clothes, which stuck to me like a leaden","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1312",164,"weight, I felt great difficulty in bearing up.  Conseil saw this.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1314",164,"""Will master let me make a slit?"" said he; and, slipping an open knife","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1315",164,"under my clothes, he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1316",164,"Then he cleverly slipped them off me, while I swam for both of us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1317",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1318",164,"Then I did the same for Conseil, and we continued to swim near to each","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1320",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1321",164,"Nevertheless, our situation was no less terrible.  Perhaps our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1322",164,"disappearance had not been noticed; and, if it had been, the frigate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1323",164,"could not tack, being without its helm.  Conseil argued on this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1324",164,"supposition, and laid his plans accordingly.  This quiet boy was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1325",164,"perfectly self-possessed. We then decided that, as our only chance of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1326",164,"safety was being picked up by the Abraham Lincoln's boats, we ought to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1327",164,"manage so as to wait for them as long as possible.  I resolved then to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1328",164,"husband our strength, so that both should not be exhausted at the same","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1329",164,"time; and this is how we managed:  while one of us lay on our back,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1330",164,"quite still, with arms crossed, and legs stretched out, the other would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1331",164,"swim and push the other on in front.  This towing business did not last","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1332",164,"more than ten minutes each; and relieving each other thus, we could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1333",164,"swim on for some hours, perhaps till day-break. Poor chance! but hope","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1334",164,"is so firmly rooted in the heart of man!  Moreover, there were two of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1335",164,"us.  Indeed I declare (though it may seem improbable) if I sought to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1338",164,"The collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1340",164,"eight hours to swim before sunrise, an operation quite practicable if","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1341",164,"we relieved each other.  The sea, very calm, was in our favour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1342",164,"Sometimes I tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1350",164,"obliged to keep me up, and our preservation devolved on him alone.  I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1351",164,"heard the poor boy pant; his breathing became short and hurried.  I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1360",164,"with its rays.  This kindly light reanimated us.  My head got better","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1361",164,"again.  I looked at all points of the horizon.  I saw the frigate!  She","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1362",164,"was five miles from us, and looked like a dark mass, hardly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1366",164,"distance!  My swollen lips could utter no sounds.  Conseil could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"1367",164,"articulate some words, and I heard him repeat at intervals, ""Help!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"1387",164,"out in a desperate effort, he raised himself half out of the water,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"3607",164,"How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I cannot judge, but, when","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3608",164,"I woke, the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon.  Captain Nemo had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3609",164,"already risen, and I was beginning to stretch my limbs, when an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3610",164,"unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3611",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3612",164,"A few steps off, a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3613",164,"high, was watching me with squinting eyes, ready to spring upon me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3614",164,"Though my diver's dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3615",164,"this animal, I could not help shuddering with horror.  Conseil and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3616",164,"sailor of the Nautilus awoke at this moment.  Captain Nemo pointed out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3617",164,"the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3618",164,"knocked over, and I saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3619",164,"terrible convulsions.  This incident reminded me that other animals","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3620",164,"more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths, against whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3621",164,"attacks my diving-dress would not protect me.  I had never thought of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3622",164,"it before, but I now resolved to be upon my guard.  Indeed, I thought","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3623",164,"that this halt would mark the termination of our walk; but I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3624",164,"mistaken, for, instead of returning to the Nautilus, Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3625",164,"continued his bold excursion.  The ground was still on the incline, its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3626",164,"declivity seemed to be getting greater, and to be leading us to greater","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3627",164,"depths.  It must have been about three o'clock when we reached a narrow","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3628",164,"valley, between high perpendicular walls, situated about seventy-five","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3629",164,"fathoms deep.  Thanks to the perfection of our apparatus, we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3630",164,"forty-five fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3631",164,"on man as to his submarine excursions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3632",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3633",164,"I say seventy-five fathoms, though I had no instrument by which to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3634",164,"judge the distance.  But I knew that even in the clearest waters the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3635",164,"solar rays could not penetrate further.  And accordingly the darkness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3636",164,"deepened.  At ten paces not an object was visible.  I was groping my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3637",164,"way, when I suddenly saw a brilliant white light.  Captain Nemo had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3638",164,"just put his electric apparatus into use; his companion did the same,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3639",164,"and Conseil and I followed their example.  By turning a screw I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3640",164,"established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3641",164,"the sea, lit by our four lanterns, was illuminated for a circle of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3642",164,"thirty-six yards.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3643",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3644",164,"As we walked I thought the light of our Ruhmkorff apparatus could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3645",164,"fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch.  But if they did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3646",164,"approach us, they at least kept at a respectful distance from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3647",164,"hunters.  Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop, put his gun to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3648",164,"shoulder, and after some moments drop it and walk on.  At last, after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3649",164,"about four hours, this marvellous excursion came to an end.  A wall of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3650",164,"superb rocks, in an imposing mass, rose before us, a heap of gigantic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3651",164,"blocks, an enormous, steep granite shore, forming dark grottos, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3652",164,"which presented no practicable slope; it was the prop of the Island of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3653",164,"Crespo.  It was the earth!  Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  A gesture","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3654",164,"of his brought us all to a halt; and, however desirous I might be to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3655",164,"scale the wall, I was obliged to stop.  Here ended Captain Nemo's","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3656",164,"domains.  And he would not go beyond them.  Further on was a portion of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3657",164,"the globe he might not trample upon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3658",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3659",164,"The return began.  Captain Nemo had returned to the head of his little","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3660",164,"band, directing their course without hesitation.  I thought we were not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3661",164,"following the same road to return to the Nautilus.  The new road was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3662",164,"very steep, and consequently very painful.  We approached the surface","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3663",164,"of the sea rapidly.  But this return to the upper strata was not so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3664",164,"sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly, which might","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3665",164,"have produced serious disorder in our organisation, and brought on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3666",164,"internal lesions, so fatal to divers.  Very soon light reappeared and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3667",164,"grew, and, the sun being low on the horizon, the refraction edged the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3668",164,"different objects with a spectral ring.  At ten yards and a half deep,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3669",164,"we walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds, more numerous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3670",164,"than the birds of the air, and also more agile; but no aquatic game","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3671",164,"worthy of a shot had as yet met our gaze, when at that moment I saw the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3672",164,"Captain shoulder his gun quickly, and follow a moving object into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3673",164,"shrubs.  He fired; I heard a slight hissing, and a creature fell","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3674",164,"stunned at some distance from us.  It was a magnificent sea-otter, an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3675",164,"enhydrus, the only exclusively marine quadruped.  This otter was five","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3676",164,"feet long, and must have been very valuable.  Its skin, chestnut-brown","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3677",164,"above and silvery underneath, would have made one of those beautiful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3678",164,"furs so sought after in the Russian and Chinese markets: the fineness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3679",164,"and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch L80.  I admired this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3680",164,"curious mammal, with its rounded head ornamented with short ears, its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3681",164,"round eyes, and white whiskers like those of a cat, with webbed feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3682",164,"and nails, and tufted tail.  This precious animal, hunted and tracked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3683",164,"by fishermen, has now become very rare, and taken refuge chiefly in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3684",164,"northern parts of the Pacific, or probably its race would soon become","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3685",164,"extinct.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3686",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3687",164,"Captain Nemo's companion took the beast, threw it over his shoulder,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3688",164,"and we continued our journey.  For one hour a plain of sand lay","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3689",164,"stretched before us.  Sometimes it rose to within two yards and some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3690",164,"inches of the surface of the water.  I then saw our image clearly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3691",164,"reflected, drawn inversely, and above us appeared an identical group","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3692",164,"reflecting our movements and our actions; in a word, like us in every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3693",164,"point, except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3694",164,"in the air.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3695",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3696",164,"Another effect I noticed, which was the passage of thick clouds which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3697",164,"formed and vanished rapidly; but on reflection I understood that these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3698",164,"seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3699",164,"bottom, and I could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3700",164,"multiplied on the water, and the shadows of large birds passing above","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3701",164,"our heads, whose rapid flight I could discern on the surface of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"3703",164,"On this occasion I was witness to one of the finest gun shots which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3704",164,"ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill.  A large bird of great breadth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3705",164,"of wing, clearly visible, approached, hovering over us.  Captain Nemo's","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3706",164,"companion shouldered his gun and fired, when it was only a few yards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3707",164,"above the waves.  The creature fell stunned, and the force of its fall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3708",164,"brought it within the reach of dexterous hunter's grasp.  It was an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3709",164,"albatross of the finest kind.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3710",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3711",164,"Our march had not been interrupted by this incident.  For two hours we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3712",164,"followed these sandy plains, then fields of algae very disagreeable to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3713",164,"cross.  Candidly, I could do no more when I saw a glimmer of light,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3714",164,"which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters.  It was the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3715",164,"lantern of the Nautilus.  Before twenty minutes were over we should be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3716",164,"on board, and I should be able to breathe with ease, for it seemed that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3717",164,"my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen.  But I did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"3720",164,"I had remained some steps behind, when I presently saw Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3721",164,"coming hurriedly towards me.  With his strong hand he bent me to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3722",164,"ground, his companion doing the same to Conseil.  At first I knew not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3723",164,"what to think of this sudden attack, but I was soon reassured by seeing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"3730",164,"My blood froze in my veins as I recognised two formidable sharks which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3731",164,"threatened us.  It was a couple of tintoreas, terrible creatures, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3732",164,"enormous tails and a dull glassy stare, the phosphorescent matter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"3744",164,"reached the Nautilus.  The outside door had been left open, and Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"3765",164,"I was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3766",164,"appeared.  He did not seem to be aware of my presence, and began a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3767",164,"series of astronomical observations.  Then, when he had finished, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3768",164,"went and leant on the cage of the watch-light, and gazed abstractedly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3769",164,"on the ocean.  In the meantime, a number of the sailors of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3770",164,"Nautilus, all strong and healthy men, had come up onto the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3771",164,"They came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night.  These","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3772",164,"sailors were evidently of different nations, although the European type","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3773",164,"was visible in all of them.  I recognised some unmistakable Irishmen,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3774",164,"Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote.  They were civil,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"3775",164,"and only used that odd language among themselves, the origin of which I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4796",164,"with a single dozen of these interesting marsupians.  These animals","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4797",164,"were small.  They were a species of those ""kangaroo rabbits"" that live","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4798",164,"habitually in the hollows of trees, and whose speed is extreme; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4800",164,"were very satisfied with the results of the hunt.  Happy Ned proposed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4801",164,"to return to this enchanting island the next day, for he wished to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4802",164,"depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds.  But he had reckoned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4814",164,"mangoes, half a dozen pineapples, and the liquor fermented from some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4851",164,"Our boat was moored about sixty feet from us.  The savages approached","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4860",164,"when a hundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4861",164,"to their waists.  I watched to see if their apparition would attract","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4862",164,"some men from the Nautilus on to the platform.  But no.  The enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4905",164,"gave his melodies an essentially Scotch character.  Soon he had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4906",164,"forgotten my presence, and had plunged into a reverie that I did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4907",164,"disturb.  I went up again on to the platform: night had already fallen;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4908",164,"for, in this low latitude, the sun sets rapidly and without twilight.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4909",164,"I could only see the island indistinctly; but the numerous fires,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4910",164,"lighted on the beach, showed that the natives did not think of leaving","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4912",164,"natives--but without any dread of them, for the imperturbable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4913",164,"confidence of the Captain was catching--sometimes forgetting them to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4914",164,"admire the splendours of the night in the tropics.  My remembrances","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4915",164,"went to France in the train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4930",164,"on to the coral, at less than two cable-lengths from the Nautilus.  I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4932",164,"figures, men of good race, large high foreheads, large, but not broad","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4933",164,"and flat, and white teeth.  Their woolly hair, with a reddish tinge,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4935",164,"From the lobes of their ears, cut and distended, hung chaplets of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4937",164,"some women, dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4938",164,"herbs, that sustained a vegetable waistband.  Some chiefs had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"4939",164,"ornamented their necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads, red","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4941",164,"carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"4966",164,"neighbouring islands, or very likely from Papua.  However, I had not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5382",164,"to which the lieutenant replied by formal assurances.  At least I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5383",164,"concluded so by the difference of their tones and gestures.  For","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5384",164,"myself, I had looked carefully in the direction indicated without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5385",164,"seeing anything.  The sky and water were lost in the clear line of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5386",164,"horizon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5387",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5388",164,"However, Captain Nemo walked from one end of the platform to the other,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5389",164,"without looking at me, perhaps without seeing me.  His step was firm,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5390",164,"but less regular than usual.  He stopped sometimes, crossed his arms,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5391",164,"and observed the sea.  What could he be looking for on that immense","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5393",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5398",164,"nervous agitation than his superior officer.  Besides, this mystery","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5399",164,"must necessarily be solved, and before long; for, upon an order from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5400",164,"Captain Nemo, the engine, increasing its propelling power, made the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5401",164,"screw turn more rapidly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5402",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5403",164,"Just then the lieutenant drew the Captain's attention again.  The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5404",164,"latter stopped walking and directed his glass towards the place","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5405",164,"indicated.  He looked long.  I felt very much puzzled, and descended to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5406",164,"the drawing-room, and took out an excellent telescope that I generally","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5407",164,"used.  Then, leaning on the cage of the watch-light that jutted out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5408",164,"from the front of the platform, set myself to look over all the line of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5409",164,"the sky and sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5410",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5411",164,"But my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5412",164,"snatched out of my hands.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5413",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5414",164,"I turned round.  Captain Nemo was before me, but I did not know him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5415",164,"His face was transfigured.  His eyes flashed sullenly; his teeth were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5416",164,"set; his stiff body, clenched fists, and head shrunk between his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5417",164,"shoulders, betrayed the violent agitation that pervaded his whole","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5418",164,"frame.  He did not move.  My glass, fallen from his hands, had rolled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5419",164,"at his feet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5420",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5421",164,"Had I unwittingly provoked this fit of anger?  Did this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5423",164,"secret?  No; I was not the object of this hatred, for he was not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5424",164,"looking at me; his eye was steadily fixed upon the impenetrable point","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5425",164,"of the horizon.  At last Captain Nemo recovered himself.  His agitation","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5426",164,"subsided.  He addressed some words in a foreign language to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5427",164,"lieutenant, then turned to me.  ""M. Aronnax,"" he said, in rather an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5443",164,"and told them the Captain's determination.  You may judge how this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5445",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5446",164,"But there was not time for altercation.  Four of the crew waited at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5488",164,"was that Conseil went off into a heavy slumber.  I was thinking what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5489",164,"could have caused his irresistible drowsiness, when I felt my brain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5490",164,"becoming stupefied.  In spite of my efforts to keep my eyes open, they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5491",164,"would close.  A painful suspicion seized me.  Evidently soporific","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5493",164,"Imprisonment was not enough to conceal Captain Nemo's projects from us,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5494",164,"sleep was more necessary.  I then heard the panels shut.  The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5495",164,"undulations of the sea, which caused a slight rolling motion, ceased.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5496",164,"Had the Nautilus quitted the surface of the ocean?  Had it gone back to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5498",164,"impossible.  My breathing grew weak.  I felt a mortal cold freeze my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"5499",164,"stiffened and half-paralysed limbs.  My eye lids, like leaden caps,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"5591",164,"shattered by some deadly weapon, left the brain exposed, which was much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6418",164,"must follow the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6419",164,"only to himself.  The ground was sensibly rising, and sometimes, on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6420",164,"holding up my arm, it was above the surface of the sea.  Then the level","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6429",164,"seemed to be extinguished by successive gradations, until its vague","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6430",164,"transparency became nothing more than drowned light.  Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6431",164,"entered; we followed.  My eyes soon accustomed themselves to this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6432",164,"relative state of darkness.  I could distinguish the arches springing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6433",164,"capriciously from natural pillars, standing broad upon their granite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6434",164,"base, like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture.  Why had our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6435",164,"incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?  I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6436",164,"was soon to know.  After descending a rather sharp declivity, our feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6437",164,"trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit.  There Captain Nemo stopped,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6438",164,"and with his hand indicated an object I had not yet perceived.  It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6439",164,"an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a goblet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6440",164,"which could have contained a whole lake of holy-water, a basin the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6441",164,"breadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6442",164,"larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the Nautilus.  I approached","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6443",164,"this extraordinary mollusc.  It adhered by its filaments to a table of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6444",164,"granite, and there, isolated, it developed itself in the calm waters of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6445",164,"the grotto.  I estimated the weight of this tridacne at 600 lb.  Such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6446",164,"an oyster would contain 30 lb. of meat; and one must have the stomach","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6451",164,"state of this tridacne.  The shells were a little open; the Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6452",164,"came near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing; then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6453",164,"with his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6454",164,"formed a cloak for the creature.  There, between the folded plaits, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6455",164,"saw a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut. Its globular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6456",164,"shape, perfect clearness, and admirable lustre made it altogether a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6457",164,"jewel of inestimable value.  Carried away by my curiosity, I stretched","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6458",164,"out my hand to seize it, weigh it, and touch it; but the Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6459",164,"stopped me, made a sign of refusal, and quickly withdrew his dagger,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6460",164,"and the two shells closed suddenly.  I then understood Captain Nemo's","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6461",164,"intention.  In leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6462",164,"he was allowing it to grow slowly.  Each year the secretions of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6463",164,"mollusc would add new concentric circles.  I estimated its value at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6466",164,"After ten minutes Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  I thought he had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6468",164,"beside him in a deep fracture of the rock, his hand pointed to one part","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6478",164,"of his canoe anchored some feet above his head.  He dived and went up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6479",164,"successively.  A stone held between his feet, cut in the shape of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6480",164,"sugar loaf, whilst a rope fastened him to his boat, helped him to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6481",164,"descend more rapidly.  This was all his apparatus.  Reaching the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6482",164,"bottom, about five yards deep, he went on his knees and filled his bag","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6483",164,"with oysters picked up at random.  Then he went up, emptied it, pulled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6484",164,"up his stone, and began the operation once more, which lasted thirty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"6489",164,"himself, should be there under the water watching his movements and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6490",164,"losing no detail of the fishing?  Several times he went up in this way,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6491",164,"and dived again.  He did not carry away more than ten at each plunge,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"6492",164,"for he was obliged to pull them from the bank to which they adhered by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"7899",164,"after all, what could I have said to him?  Ned Land was perfectly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"7900",164,"right.  There was almost the opportunity to profit by.  Could I retract","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"7928",164,"case of its discovery or failure.  Certainly I had no cause to complain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"7930",164,"leaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude.  No oath bound us to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"7937",164,"walking the room contiguous to mine.  No sound reached my ear.  I felt","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"7938",164,"an unbearable uneasiness.  This day of waiting seemed eternal.  Hours","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"7941",164,"My dinner was served in my room as usual.  I ate but little; I was too","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"8789",164,"entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass, kept some yards beneath the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8790",164,"surface of the waves.  The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"8825",164,"carrying us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"8845",164,"During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8846",164,"happened to signalise our voyage.  I saw little of the Captain; he was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8847",164,"at work.  In the library I often found his books left open, especially","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8848",164,"those on natural history.  My work on submarine depths, conned over by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8849",164,"him, was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting my theories","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8850",164,"and systems; but the Captain contented himself with thus purging my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8851",164,"work; it was very rare for him to discuss it with me.  Sometimes I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8852",164,"heard the melancholy tones of his organ; but only at night, in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"8854",164,"deserted ocean.  During this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"8859",164,"did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble, so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8860",164,"ended the chase by plunging under the water.  Our navigation continued","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8861",164,"until the 13th of March; that day the Nautilus was employed in taking","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8862",164,"soundings, which greatly interested me.  We had then made about 13,000","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8863",164,"leagues since our departure from the high seas of the Pacific.  The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8864",164,"bearings gave us 45 deg. 37' S. lat., and 37 deg. 53' W. long.  It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8865",164,"the same water in which Captain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8866",164,"fathoms without finding the bottom.  There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8867",164,"the American frigate Congress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8868",164,"fathoms.  Captain Nemo intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8869",164,"diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8870",164,"an angle of 45 deg. with the water-line of the Nautilus.  Then the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8871",164,"screw set to work at its maximum speed, its four blades beating the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"8872",164,"waves with in describable force.  Under this powerful pressure, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9189",164,"was only just time to go to the help of the whales.  The Nautilus went","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9198",164,"formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand of its Captain.  It hurled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9200",164,"other, leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal.  It could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9201",164,"not feel the formidable blows from their tails upon its sides, nor the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9221",164,"quiet, and I felt that we were rising to the surface.  The panel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9222",164,"opened, and we hurried on to the platform.  The sea was covered with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9223",164,"mutilated bodies.  A formidable explosion could not have divided and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9251",164,"unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side, riddled with holes from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9288",164,"presence of an ice pack or bank.  Accordingly, larger blocks soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9289",164,"appeared, whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog.  Some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9290",164,"of these masses showed green veins, as if long undulating lines had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9298",164,"At 60 deg. lat. every pass had disappeared.  But, seeking carefully,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9299",164,"Captain Nemo soon found a narrow opening, through which he boldly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9300",164,"slipped, knowing, however, that it would close behind him.  Thus,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9306",164,"temperature was very low; the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9310",164,"Besides, it would only have been necessary to go some yards beneath the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9311",164,"waves to find a more bearable temperature.  Two months earlier we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9312",164,"should have had perpetual daylight in these latitudes; but already we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9315",164,"we were in the latitude of New Shetland and South Orkney.  The Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9349",164,"accompanied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the platform","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9531",164,"was kept up, in forty hours we should reach the pole.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9533",164,"For a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9534",164,"window.  The sea was lit with the electric lantern; but it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9535",164,"deserted; fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; they only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9536",164,"found there a passage to take them from the Antarctic Ocean to the open","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9537",164,"polar sea.  Our pace was rapid; we could feel it by the quivering of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9538",164,"the long steel body.  About two in the morning I took some hours'","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9539",164,"repose, and Conseil did the same.  In crossing the waist I did not meet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9540",164,"Captain Nemo: I supposed him to be in the pilot's cage.  The next","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9541",164,"morning, the 19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9542",164,"The electric log told me that the speed of the Nautilus had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9543",164,"slackened.  It was then going towards the surface; but prudently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9544",164,"emptying its reservoirs very slowly.  My heart beat fast.  Were we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9545",164,"going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere?  No!  A shock","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9546",164,"told me that the Nautilus had struck the bottom of the iceberg, still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9547",164,"very thick, judging from the deadened sound.  We had in deed ""struck,""","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9548",164,"to use a sea expression, but in an inverse sense, and at a thousand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9549",164,"feet deep.  This would give three thousand feet of ice above us; one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9550",164,"thousand being above the water-mark. The iceberg was then higher than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9551",164,"at its borders--not a very reassuring fact.  Several times that day the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9552",164,"Nautilus tried again, and every time it struck the wall which lay like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9553",164,"a ceiling above it.  Sometimes it met with but 900 yards, only 200 of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9554",164,"which rose above the surface.  It was twice the height it was when the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9555",164,"Nautilus had gone under the waves.  I carefully noted the different","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9556",164,"depths, and thus obtained a submarine profile of the chain as it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9557",164,"developed under the water.  That night no change had taken place in our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9558",164,"situation.  Still ice between four and five hundred yards in depth!  It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9559",164,"was evidently diminishing, but, still, what a thickness between us and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9560",164,"the surface of the ocean!  It was then eight.  According to the daily","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9561",164,"custom on board the Nautilus, its air should have been renewed four","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9562",164,"hours ago; but I did not suffer much, although Captain Nemo had not yet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9563",164,"made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen.  My sleep was painful that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9564",164,"night; hope and fear besieged me by turns: I rose several times.  The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9565",164,"groping of the Nautilus continued.  About three in the morning, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9566",164,"noticed that the lower surface of the iceberg was only about fifty feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9567",164,"deep.  One hundred and fifty feet now separated us from the surface of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9568",164,"the waters.  The iceberg was by degrees becoming an ice-field, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9569",164,"mountain a plain.  My eyes never left the manometer.  We were still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9570",164,"rising diagonally to the surface, which sparkled under the electric","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9571",164,"rays.  The iceberg was stretching both above and beneath into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9594",164,"""I do not know,"" he replied.  ""At noon I will take our bearings.""","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9595",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9596",164,"""But will the sun show himself through this fog?"" said I, looking at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9598",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9600",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9601",164,"About ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9602",164,"and four yards.  We made for it, but carefully, for the sea might be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9603",164,"strewn with banks.  One hour afterwards we had reached it, two hours","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9604",164,"later we had made the round of it.  It measured four or five miles in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9605",164,"circumference.  A narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9606",164,"of land, perhaps a continent, for we could not see its limits.  The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9607",164,"existence of this land seemed to give some colour to Maury's theory.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9608",164,"The ingenious American has remarked that, between the South Pole and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9609",164,"the sixtieth parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9610",164,"size, which is never met with in the North Atlantic.  From this fact he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9611",164,"has drawn the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle encloses","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9612",164,"considerable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9613",164,"on the coasts.  According to these calculations, the mass of ice","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9614",164,"surrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap, the circumference of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9615",164,"which must be, at least, 2,500 miles.  But the Nautilus, for fear of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9616",164,"running aground, had stopped about three cable-lengths from a strand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9617",164,"over which reared a superb heap of rocks.  The boat was launched; the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9618",164,"Captain, two of his men, bearing instruments, Conseil, and myself were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9620",164,"the Canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the South Pole.  A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9621",164,"few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand, where we ran ashore.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9622",164,"Conseil was going to jump on to the land, when I held him back.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9631",164,"Saying this, he jumped lightly on to the sand.  His heart beat with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9632",164,"emotion.  He climbed a rock, sloping to a little promontory, and there,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9633",164,"with his arms crossed, mute and motionless, and with an eager look, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9634",164,"seemed to take possession of these southern regions.  After five","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9635",164,"minutes passed in this ecstasy, he turned to us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9639",164,"I landed, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men in the boat.  For a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9640",164,"long way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9641",164,"crushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumice-stones. One could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9642",164,"not mistake its volcanic origin.  In some parts, slight curls of smoke","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9643",164,"emitted a sulphurous smell, proving that the internal fires had lost","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9644",164,"nothing of their expansive powers, though, having climbed a high","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9645",164,"acclivity, I could see no volcano for a radius of several miles.  We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9646",164,"know that in those Antarctic countries, James Ross found two craters,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9648",164,"latitude 77 deg. 32'. The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9649",164,"to me much restricted.  Some lichens lay upon the black rocks; some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9650",164,"microscopic plants, rudimentary diatomas, a kind of cells placed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9651",164,"between two quartz shells; long purple and scarlet weed, supported on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9652",164,"little swimming bladders, which the breaking of the waves brought to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9654",164,"shore was strewn with molluscs, little mussels, and limpets.  I also","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9655",164,"saw myriads of northern clios, one-and-a-quarter inches long, of which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9656",164,"a whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful; and some perfect","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9657",164,"sea-butterflies, animating the waters on the skirts of the shore.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9658",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9659",164,"There appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs, of the kind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9661",164,"of more than 1,000 yards.  Then there were little kingfishers and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9662",164,"starfish studding the soil.  But where life abounded most was in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9663",164,"air.  There thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9664",164,"deafening us with their cries; others crowded the rock, looking at us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9665",164,"as we passed by without fear, and pressing familiarly close by our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9666",164,"feet.  There were penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9667",164,"they are on the ground; they were uttering harsh cries, a large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9668",164,"assembly, sober in gesture, but extravagant in clamour.  Albatrosses","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9669",164,"passed in the air, the expanse of their wings being at least four yards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9808",164,"near him, his eyes fixed on the northern horizon, near which the sun","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9809",164,"was then describing a lengthened curve.  I took my place beside him,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9938",164,"The next day, the 22nd of March, at six in the morning, preparations","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9939",164,"for departure were begun.  The last gleams of twilight were melting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9940",164,"into night.  The cold was great, the constellations shone with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9941",164,"wonderful intensity.  In the zenith glittered that wondrous Southern","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9942",164,"Cross--the polar bear of Antarctic regions.  The thermometer showed 120","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9943",164,"below zero, and when the wind freshened it was most biting.  Flakes of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9944",164,"ice increased on the open water.  The sea seemed everywhere alike.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9945",164,"Numerous blackish patches spread on the surface, showing the formation","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9946",164,"of fresh ice.  Evidently the southern basin, frozen during the six","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9947",164,"winter months, was absolutely inaccessible.  What became of the whales","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9948",164,"in that time?  Doubtless they went beneath the icebergs, seeking more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9949",164,"practicable seas.  As to the seals and morses, accustomed to live in a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9950",164,"hard climate, they remained on these icy shores.  These creatures have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9951",164,"the instinct to break holes in the ice-field and to keep them open.  To","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9952",164,"these holes they come for breath; when the birds, driven away by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9953",164,"cold, have emigrated to the north, these sea mammals remain sole","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9954",164,"masters of the polar continent.  But the reservoirs were filling with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9955",164,"water, and the Nautilus was slowly descending.  At 1,000 feet deep it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9956",164,"stopped; its screw beat the waves, and it advanced straight towards the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9957",164,"north at a speed of fifteen miles an hour.  Towards night it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9958",164,"already floating under the immense body of the iceberg.  At three in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9959",164,"the morning I was awakened by a violent shock.  I sat up in my bed and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9960",164,"listened in the darkness, when I was thrown into the middle of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9961",164,"room.  The Nautilus, after having struck, had rebounded violently.  I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9962",164,"groped along the partition, and by the staircase to the saloon, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9963",164,"was lit by the luminous ceiling.  The furniture was upset.  Fortunately","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9964",164,"the windows were firmly set, and had held fast.  The pictures on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9966",164,"paper, whilst those of the port side were hanging at least a foot from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9967",164,"the wall.  The Nautilus was lying on its starboard side perfectly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9968",164,"motionless.  I heard footsteps, and a confusion of voices; but Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"9969",164,"Nemo did not appear.  As I was leaving the saloon, Ned Land and Conseil","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"9985",164,"great surprise, it showed a depth of more than 180 fathoms.  ""What does","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10075",164,"side of the Nautilus, rose a dazzling wall of ice.  Above and beneath","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10076",164,"the same wall.  Above, because the lower surface of the iceberg","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10259",164,"and among them Ned Land, easily known by his stature.  Captain Nemo was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10260",164,"with them.  Before proceeding to dig the walls, he took the soundings,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10261",164,"to be sure of working in the right direction.  Long sounding lines were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10262",164,"sunk in the side walls, but after fifteen yards they were again stopped","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10263",164,"by the thick wall.  It was useless to attack it on the ceiling-like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10264",164,"surface, since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10265",164,"height.  Captain Nemo then sounded the lower surface.  There ten yards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10266",164,"of wall separated us from the water, so great was the thickness of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10267",164,"ice-field. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from it a piece equal in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10268",164,"extent to the waterline of the Nautilus.  There were about 6,000 cubic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10269",164,"yards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10270",164,"ice-field. The work had begun immediately and carried on with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10271",164,"indefatigable energy.  Instead of digging round the Nautilus which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10272",164,"would have involved greater difficulty, Captain Nemo had an immense","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10273",164,"trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter. Then the men set to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10274",164,"work simultaneously with their screws on several points of its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10275",164,"circumference.  Presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10276",164,"vigorously, and large blocks were detached from the mass.  By a curious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10277",164,"effect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than water, fled, so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10280",164,"little, so long as the lower part grew thinner.  After two hours' hard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10281",164,"work, Ned Land came in exhausted.  He and his comrades were replaced by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10282",164,"new workers, whom Conseil and I joined.  The second lieutenant of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10284",164,"soon got warm handling the pickaxe.  My movements were free enough,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10285",164,"although they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.  When I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10487",164,"opened, and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in, increasing the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10488",164,"weight of the Nautilus to 1,800 tons.  We waited, we listened,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10489",164,"forgetting our sufferings in hope.  Our safety depended on this last","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10490",164,"chance.  Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon heard the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10491",164,"humming sound under the hull of the Nautilus.  The ice cracked with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10492",164,"singular noise, like tearing paper, and the Nautilus sank.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10496",164,"I could not answer him.  I seized his hand, and pressed it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10497",164,"convulsively.  All at once, carried away by its frightful overcharge,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10498",164,"the Nautilus sank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10501",164,"After some minutes, our fall was stopped.  Soon, too, the manometer","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10506",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10507",164,"Half stretched upon a divan in the library, I was suffocating.  My face","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10508",164,"was purple, my lips blue, my faculties suspended.  I neither saw nor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10509",164,"heard.  All notion of time had gone from my mind.  My muscles could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10510",164,"contract.  I do not know how many hours passed thus, but I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10511",164,"conscious of the agony that was coming over me.  I felt as if I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10512",164,"going to die.  Suddenly I came to.  Some breaths of air penetrated my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10513",164,"lungs.  Had we risen to the surface of the waves?  Were we free of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10514",164,"iceberg?  No!  Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends, were sacrificing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10515",164,"themselves to save me.  Some particles of air still remained at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10516",164,"bottom of one apparatus.  Instead of using it, they had kept it for me,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10517",164,"and, while they were being suffocated, they gave me life, drop by drop.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10518",164,"I wanted to push back the thing; they held my hands, and for some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10519",164,"moments I breathed freely.  I looked at the clock; it was eleven in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10520",164,"morning.  It ought to be the 28th of March.  The Nautilus went at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10521",164,"frightful pace, forty miles an hour.  It literally tore through the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10522",164,"water.  Where was Captain Nemo?  Had he succumbed?  Were his companions","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10523",164,"dead with him?  At the moment the manometer indicated that we were not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10524",164,"more than twenty feet from the surface.  A mere plate of ice separated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10525",164,"us from the atmosphere.  Could we not break it?  Perhaps.  In any case","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10526",164,"the Nautilus was going to attempt it.  I felt that it was in an oblique","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10527",164,"position, lowering the stern, and raising the bows.  The introduction","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10528",164,"of water had been the means of disturbing its equilibrium.  Then,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10529",164,"impelled by its powerful screw, it attacked the ice-field from beneath","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10530",164,"like a formidable battering-ram.  It broke it by backing and then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10531",164,"rushing forward against the field, which gradually gave way; and at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10532",164,"last, dashing suddenly against it, shot forwards on the ice-field, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10533",164,"crushed beneath its weight.  The panel was opened--one might say torn","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10599",164,"the Nautilus ascended to the surface some minutes before noon, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"10600",164,"sighted land to the west.  It was Terra del Fuego, which the first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"10603",164,"rose high mountains.  I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11288",164,"I watched these raging waves attentively.  They measured fifteen feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11290",164,"was thirty feet per second.  Their bulk and power increased with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11298",164,"to lie to under half steam, to keep up above the waves.  It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11299",164,"probably one of the steamers of the line from New York to Liverpool, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11301",164,"evening the sky was on fire.  The atmosphere was streaked with vivid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11302",164,"lightning.  I could not bear the brightness of it; while the captain,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11303",164,"looking at it, seemed to envy the spirit of the tempest.  A terrible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11304",164,"noise filled the air, a complex noise, made up of the howls of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11305",164,"crushed waves, the roaring of the wind, and the claps of thunder.  The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11306",164,"wind veered suddenly to all points of the horizon; and the cyclone,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11307",164,"rising in the east, returned after passing by the north, west, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11308",164,"south, in the inverse course pursued by the circular storm of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11309",164,"southern hemisphere.  Ah, that Gulf Stream!  It deserves its name of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11310",164,"the King of Tempests.  It is that which causes those formidable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11311",164,"cyclones, by the difference of temperature between its air and its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11312",164,"currents.  A shower of fire had succeeded the rain.  The drops of water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11313",164,"were changed to sharp spikes.  One would have thought that Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11317",164,"Crushed and without strength I crawled to the panel, opened it, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11318",164,"descended to the saloon.  The storm was then at its height.  It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11319",164,"impossible to stand upright in the interior of the Nautilus.  Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11320",164,"Nemo came down about twelve.  I heard the reservoirs filling by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11322",164,"open windows in the saloon I saw large fish terrified, passing like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11323",164,"phantoms in the water.  Some were struck before my eyes.  The Nautilus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11324",164,"was still descending.  I thought that at about eight fathoms deep we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11325",164,"should find a calm.  But no! the upper beds were too violently agitated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11352",164,"On the 15th of May we were at the extreme south of the Bank of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11353",164,"Newfoundland.  This bank consists of alluvia, or large heaps of organic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11358",164,"of molluscs, which perish here by millions.  The depth of the sea is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11359",164,"not great at Newfoundland--not more than some hundreds of fathoms; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11365",164,"depth of more than 1,400 fathoms, that I saw the electric cable lying","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11370",164,"1858; but, after transmitting about 400 telegrams, would not act any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11371",164,"longer.  In 1863 the engineers constructed an other one, measuring","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11372",164,"2,000 miles in length, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11381",164,"at night they had recovered the damaged part.  They made another point","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11382",164,"and spliced it, and it was once more submerged.  But some days after it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11383",164,"broke again, and in the depths of the ocean could not be recaptured.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11384",164,"The Americans, however, were not discouraged.  Cyrus Field, the bold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11386",164,"new subscription on foot, which was at once answered, and another cable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11390",164,"the 13th of July, 1866.  The operation worked well.  But one incident","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11391",164,"occurred.  Several times in unrolling the cable they observed that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11609",164,"been so; and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11610",164,"destruction.  Terrible indeed! if, as we supposed, Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11611",164,"employed the Nautilus in works of vengeance.  On the night when we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11615",164,"it must be so.  One part of the mysterious existence of Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11616",164,"had been unveiled; and, if his identity had not been recognised, at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11617",164,"least, the nations united against him were no longer hunting a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11620",164,"friends on board the approaching ship, we could only expect pitiless","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11622",164,"and ricochetted, losing themselves in the distance.  But none touched","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11623",164,"the Nautilus.  The vessel was not more than three miles from us.  In","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11624",164,"spite of the serious cannonade, Captain Nemo did not appear on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11686",164,"ventured on to the platform.  The Captain was still walking up and down","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11715",164,"the Nautilus had not altered its course.  It was on the surface,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11759",164,"steps were taken which might be called the signal for action.  They","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11760",164,"were very simple.  The iron balustrade around the platform was lowered,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11761",164,"and the lantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11794",164,"listened, every sense was merged in that of hearing!  The speed of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11795",164,"Nautilus was accelerated.  It was preparing to rush.  The whole ship","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11796",164,"trembled.  Suddenly I screamed.  I felt the shock, but comparatively","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11797",164,"light.  I felt the penetrating power of the steel spur.  I heard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11798",164,"rattlings and scrapings.  But the Nautilus, carried along by its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11799",164,"propelling power, passed through the mass of the vessel like a needle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11800",164,"through sailcloth!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11801",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11802",164,"I could stand it no longer.  Mad, out of my mind, I rushed from my room","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11803",164,"into the saloon.  Captain Nemo was there, mute, gloomy, implacable; he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11804",164,"was looking through the port panel.  A large mass cast a shadow on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11805",164,"water; and, that it might lose nothing of her agony, the Nautilus was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11806",164,"going down into the abyss with her.  Ten yards from me I saw the open","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11807",164,"shell, through which the water was rushing with the noise of thunder,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11808",164,"then the double line of guns and the netting.  The bridge was covered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11809",164,"with black, agitated shadows.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11810",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11811",164,"The water was rising.  The poor creatures were crowding the ratlines,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11812",164,"clinging to the masts, struggling under the water.  It was a human","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11813",164,"ant-heap overtaken by the sea.  Paralysed, stiffened with anguish, my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11814",164,"hair standing on end, with eyes wide open, panting, without breath, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11815",164,"without voice, I too was watching!  An irresistible attraction glued me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11816",164,"to the glass!  Suddenly an explosion took place.  The compressed air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11817",164,"blew up her decks, as if the magazines had caught fire.  Then the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11818",164,"unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly.  Her topmast, laden with victims,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11819",164,"now appeared; then her spars, bending under the weight of men; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11820",164,"last of all, the top of her mainmast.  Then the dark mass disappeared,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11821",164,"and with it the dead crew, drawn down by the strong eddy.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11822",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11823",164,"I turned to Captain Nemo.  That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11824",164,"of hatred, was still looking.  When all was over, he turned to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11825",164,"room, opened the door, and entered.  I followed him with my eyes.  On","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11826",164,"the end wall beneath his heroes, I saw the portrait of a woman, still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11827",164,"young, and two little children.  Captain Nemo looked at them for some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11828",164,"moments, stretched his arms towards them, and, kneeling down, burst","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11839",164,"Nautilus.  At wonderful speed, a hundred feet beneath the water, it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11840",164,"leaving this desolate spot.  Whither was it going?  To the north or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11841",164,"south?  Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation?  I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11842",164,"had returned to my room, where Ned and Conseil had remained silent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11843",164,"enough.  I felt an insurmountable horror for Captain Nemo.  Whatever he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11844",164,"had suffered at the hands of these men, he had no right to punish thus.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11845",164,"He had made me, if not an accomplice, at least a witness of his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11846",164,"vengeance.  At eleven the electric light reappeared.  I passed into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11847",164,"saloon.  It was deserted.  I consulted the different instruments.  The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11848",164,"Nautilus was flying northward at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11849",164,"now on the surface, and now thirty feet below it.  On taking the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11850",164,"bearings by the chart, I saw that we were passing the mouth of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11851",164,"Manche, and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seas","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11852",164,"at a frightful speed.  That night we had crossed two hundred leagues of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11853",164,"the Atlantic.  The shadows fell, and the sea was covered with darkness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11854",164,"until the rising of the moon.  I went to my room, but could not sleep.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11855",164,"I was troubled with dreadful nightmare.  The horrible scene of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11856",164,"destruction was continually before my eyes.  From that day, who could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11857",164,"tell into what part of the North Atlantic basin the Nautilus would take","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11858",164,"us?  Still with unaccountable speed.  Still in the midst of these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11859",164,"northern fogs.  Would it touch at Spitzbergen, or on the shores of Nova","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11860",164,"Zembla?  Should we explore those unknown seas, the White Sea, the Sea","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11861",164,"of Kara, the Gulf of Obi, the Archipelago of Liarrov, and the unknown","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11862",164,"coast of Asia?  I could not say.  I could no longer judge of the time","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11863",164,"that was passing.  The clocks had been stopped on board.  It seemed, as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11864",164,"in polar countries, that night and day no longer followed their regular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11865",164,"course.  I felt myself being drawn into that strange region where the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11866",164,"foundered imagination of Edgar Poe roamed at will.  Like the fabulous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11869",164,"earth, thrown across the cataract which defends the approach to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11870",164,"pole."" I estimated (though, perhaps, I may be mistaken)--I estimated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11871",164,"this adventurous course of the Nautilus to have lasted fifteen or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11872",164,"twenty days.  And I know not how much longer it might have lasted, had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11873",164,"it not been for the catastrophe which ended this voyage.  Of Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11874",164,"Nemo I saw nothing whatever now, nor of his second.  Not a man of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11875",164,"crew was visible for an instant.  The Nautilus was almost incessantly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11876",164,"under water.  When we came to the surface to renew the air, the panels","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11877",164,"opened and shut mechanically.  There were no more marks on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11878",164,"planisphere.  I knew not where we were.  And the Canadian, too, his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11879",164,"strength and patience at an end, appeared no more.  Conseil could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11880",164,"draw a word from him; and, fearing that, in a dreadful fit of madness,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11881",164,"he might kill himself, watched him with constant devotion.  One morning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11882",164,"(what date it was I could not say) I had fallen into a heavy sleep","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11883",164,"towards the early hours, a sleep both painful and unhealthy, when I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11884",164,"suddenly awoke.  Ned Land was leaning over me, saying, in a low voice,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11919",164,"and yet hoping to see Captain Nemo, wishing and yet not wishing to see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11921",164,"horror with which he inspired me?  No. It was better that I should not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11922",164,"meet him face to face; better to forget him.  And yet----  How long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11923",164,"seemed that day, the last that I should pass in the Nautilus.  I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11924",164,"remained alone.  Ned Land and Conseil avoided speaking, for fear of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11925",164,"betraying themselves.  At six I dined, but I was not hungry; I forced","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11934",164,"running N.N.E. at frightful speed, and more than fifty yards deep.  I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11935",164,"cast a last look on these wonders of nature, on the riches of art","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11937",164,"perish at the bottom of the sea, with him who had formed it.  I wished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11942",164,"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11943",164,"I dressed myself in strong sea clothing.  I collected my notes, placing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11944",164,"them carefully about me.  My heart beat loudly.  I could not check its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11945",164,"pulsations.  Certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11946",164,"to Captain Nemo's eyes.  What was he doing at this moment?  I listened","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11947",164,"at the door of his room.  I heard steps.  Captain Nemo was there.  He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11948",164,"had not gone to rest.  At every moment I expected to see him appear,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11949",164,"and ask me why I wished to fly.  I was constantly on the alert.  My","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11950",164,"imagination magnified everything.  The impression became at last so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11951",164,"poignant that I asked myself if it would not be better to go to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11955",164,"It was the inspiration of a madman; fortunately I resisted the desire,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11956",164,"and stretched myself on my bed to quiet my bodily agitation.  My nerves","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11957",164,"were somewhat calmer, but in my excited brain I saw over again all my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"

"11966",164,"eyes like scenes in a drama.  Then Captain Nemo seemed to grow","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
"11967",164,"enormously, his features to assume superhuman proportions.  He was no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","Verne, Jules","Science Fiction","en"
