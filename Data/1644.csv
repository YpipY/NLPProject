"84",1644,"of the cavalry, and I was in front of the Hussars. But of all the cities","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"85",1644,"which we visited Venice is the most ill-built and ridiculous. I cannot","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"86",1644,"imagine how the people who laid it out thought that the cavalry could","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"87",1644,"manoeuvre. It would puzzle Murat or Lassalle to bring a squadron into","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"88",1644,"that square of theirs. For this reason we left Kellermann's heavy","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"90",1644,"Suchet with the infantry held the town, and he had chosen me as his","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"91",1644,"aide-de-camp for that winter, because he was pleased about the affair","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"92",1644,"of the Italian fencing-master at Milan. The fellow was a good swordsman,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"93",1644,"and it was fortunate for the credit of French arms that it was I who was","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"102",1644,"You have not been to Venice? No, for it is seldom that the French","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"104",1644,"we had travelled everywhere, but we went in larger parties than were","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"105",1644,"convenient to those whom we visited, and we carried our passports in","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"106",1644,"our limbers. It will be a bad day for Europe when the French start","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"107",1644,"travelling again, for they are slow to leave their homes, but when they","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"108",1644,"have done so no one can say how far they will go if they have a guide","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"109",1644,"like our little man to point out the way. But the great days are gone","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"113",1644,"But it is of Venice that I would speak. The folk there live like","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"114",1644,"water-rats upon a mud-bank, but the houses are very fine, and the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"115",1644,"churches, especially that of St. Mark, are as great as any I have seen.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"116",1644,"But above all they are proud of their statues and their pictures, which","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"117",1644,"are the most famous in Europe. There are many soldiers who think that","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"118",1644,"because one's trade is to make war one should never have a thought above","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"119",1644,"fighting and plunder. There was old Bouvet, for example--the one who was","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"120",1644,"killed by the Prussians on the day that I won the Emperor's medal; if","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"122",1644,"books or of art, he would sit and stare at you. But the highest soldier","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"123",1644,"is a man like myself who can understand the things of the mind and the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"124",1644,"soul. It is true that I was very young when I joined the army, and that","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"125",1644,"the quarter-master was my only teacher, but if you go about the world","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"126",1644,"with your eyes open you cannot help learning a great deal.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"127",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"128",1644,"Thus I was able to admire the pictures in Venice, and to know the names","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"129",1644,"of the great men, Michael Titiens, and Angelus, and the others, who had","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"130",1644,"painted them. No one can say that Napoleon did not admire them also, for","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"131",1644,"the very first thing which he did when he captured the town was to send","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"132",1644,"the best of them to Paris. We all took what we could get, and I had two","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"133",1644,"pictures for my share.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"134",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"135",1644,"One of them, called ""Nymphs Surprised,"" I kept for myself, and the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"136",1644,"other, ""Saint Barbara,"" I sent as a present for my mother.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"137",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"138",1644,"It must be confessed, however, that some of our men behaved very badly","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"139",1644,"in this matter of the statues and the pictures. The people at Venice","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"140",1644,"were very much attached to them, and as to the four bronze horses which","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"141",1644,"stood over the gate of their great church, they loved them as dearly as","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"142",1644,"if they had been their children. I have always been a judge of a horse,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"143",1644,"and I had a good look at these ones, but I could not see that there was","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"144",1644,"much to be said for them. They were too coarse-limbed for light cavalry","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"145",1644,"charges and they had not the weight for the gun-teams.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"146",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"147",1644,"However, they were the only four horses, alive or dead, in the whole","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"148",1644,"town, so it was not to be expected that the people would know any","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"149",1644,"better. They wept bitterly when they were sent away, and ten French","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"150",1644,"soldiers were found floating in the canals that night. As a punishment","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"151",1644,"for these murders a great many more of their pictures were sent away,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"152",1644,"and the soldiers took to breaking the statues and firing their muskets","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"153",1644,"at the stained-glass windows.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"154",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"155",1644,"This made the people furious, and there was very bad feeling in the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"156",1644,"town. Many officers and men disappeared during that winter, and even","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"157",1644,"their bodies were never found.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"159",1644,"For myself I had plenty to do, and I never found the time heavy on","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"160",1644,"my hands. In every country it has been my custom to try to learn the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"161",1644,"language. For this reason I always look round for some lady who will be","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"162",1644,"kind enough to teach it to me, and then we practise it together. This","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"163",1644,"is the most interesting way of picking it up, and before I was thirty I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"164",1644,"could speak nearly every tongue in Europe; but it must be confessed that","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"165",1644,"what you learn is not of much use for the ordinary purposes of life. My","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"166",1644,"business, for example, has usually been with soldiers and peasants, and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"167",1644,"what advantage is it to be able to say to them that I love only them,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"170",1644,"Never have I had so sweet a teacher as in Venice. Lucia was her first","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"171",1644,"name, and her second--but a gentleman forgets second names. I can say","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"172",1644,"this with all discretion, that she was of one of the senatorial families","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"173",1644,"of Venice and that her grandfather had been Doge of the town.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"176",1644,"word as ""exquisite,"" my friends, it has a meaning. I have judgment, I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"177",1644,"have memories, I have the means of comparison. Of all the women who have","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"1611",1644,"able to pick out one large stained-glass window which must belong to the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"1612",1644,"chapel. I had understood from Hubert that the Mother Superior's room,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"1616",1644,"and how could I get in without explanations? But a sudden inspiration","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"1617",1644,"showed me how the thing might be done. In the garden was a well, and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"1618",1644,"beside the well were a number of empty buckets. I filled two of these,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"1682",1644,"German baroness whose name I may not mention. It shone brightly in","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"3333",1644,"will be pleased to hear that there were few things in which I could","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3334",1644,"not hold my own, and in some I excelled. Behind the house was a wood in","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3335",1644,"which pheasants were reared, and it was Lord Rufton's joy to kill these","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3336",1644,"birds, which was done by sending in men to drive them out while he and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3337",1644,"his friends stood outside and shot them as they passed. For my part, I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3338",1644,"was more crafty, for I studied the habits of the bird, and stealing out","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3339",1644,"in the evening I was able to kill a number of them as they roosted in","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3340",1644,"the trees. Hardly a single shot was wasted, but the keeper was attracted","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3341",1644,"by the sound of the firing, and he implored me in his rough English","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3342",1644,"fashion to spare those that were left. That night I was able to place","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3343",1644,"twelve birds as a surprise upon Lord Rufton's supper-table, and he","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3344",1644,"laughed until he cried, so overjoyed was he to see them. ""Gad, Gerard,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3345",1644,"you'll be the death of me yet!"" he cried. Often he said the same thing,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3346",1644,"for at every turn I amazed him by the way in which I entered into the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3347",1644,"sports of the English.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3348",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3349",1644,"There is a game called cricket which they play in the summer, and this","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3350",1644,"also I learned. Rudd, the head gardener, was a famous player of cricket,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3351",1644,"and so was Lord Rufton himself. Before the house was a lawn, and here","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3352",1644,"it was that Rudd taught me the game. It is a brave pastime, a game for","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3353",1644,"soldiers, for each tries to strike the other with the ball, and it is","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3354",1644,"but a small stick with which you may ward it off. Three sticks behind","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3355",1644,"show the spot beyond which you may not retreat. I can tell you that it","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3356",1644,"is no game for children, and I will confess that, in spite of my nine","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3357",1644,"campaigns, I felt myself turn pale when first the ball flashed past me.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3358",1644,"So swift was it that I had not time to raise my stick to ward it off,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3359",1644,"but by good fortune it missed me and knocked down the wooden pins which","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3360",1644,"marked the boundary. It was for Rudd then to defend himself and for me","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3361",1644,"to attack. When I was a boy in Gascony I learned to throw both far and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3362",1644,"straight, so that I made sure that I could hit this gallant Englishman.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3363",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3364",1644,"With a shout I rushed forward and hurled the ball at him. It flew as","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3365",1644,"swift as a bullet toward his ribs, but without a word he swung his staff","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3366",1644,"and the ball rose a surprising distance in the air. Lord Rufton clapped","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3367",1644,"his hands and cheered. Again the ball was brought to me, and again it","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3368",1644,"was for me to throw. This time it flew past his head, and it seemed to","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3369",1644,"me that it was his turn to look pale.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3370",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3371",1644,"But he was a brave man, this gardener, and again he faced me. Ah, my","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3372",1644,"friends, the hour of my triumph had come! It was a red waistcoat that","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3373",1644,"he wore, and at this I hurled the ball. You would have said that I was","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3374",1644,"a gunner, not a hussar, for never was so straight an aim. With a","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3375",1644,"despairing cry--the cry of the brave man who is beaten--he fell upon the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3376",1644,"wooden pegs behind him, and they all rolled upon the ground together. He","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3377",1644,"was cruel, this English milord, and he laughed so that he could not come","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3378",1644,"to the aid of his servant. It was for me, the victor, to rush forward to","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3379",1644,"embrace this intrepid player, and to raise him to his feet with words of","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3380",1644,"praise, and encouragement, and hope. He was in pain and could not stand","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3381",1644,"erect, yet the honest fellow confessed that there was no accident in my","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3382",1644,"victory. ""He did it a-purpose! He did it a-purpose!""","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3383",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3384",1644,"Again and again he said it. Yes, it is a great game this cricket, and I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3385",1644,"would gladly have ventured upon it again but Lord Rufton and Rudd said","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3386",1644,"that it was late in the season, and so they would play no more.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3387",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3388",1644,"How foolish of me, the old, broken man, to dwell upon these successes,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3389",1644,"and yet I will confess that my age has been very much soothed and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3390",1644,"comforted by the memory of the women who have loved me and the men whom","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3391",1644,"I have overcome. It is pleasant to think that five years afterward, when","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3392",1644,"Lord Rufton came to Paris after the peace, he was able to assure me that","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3393",1644,"my name was still a famous one in the north of Devonshire for the fine","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3394",1644,"exploits that I had performed. Especially, he said, they still talked","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3395",1644,"over my boxing match with the Honourable Baldock. It came about in this","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3396",1644,"way. Of an evening many sportsmen would assemble at the house of Lord","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3397",1644,"Rufton, where they would drink much wine, make wild bets, and talk","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3398",1644,"of their horses and their foxes. How well I remember those strange","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3399",1644,"creatures. Sir Barrington, Jack Lupton, of Barnstable, Colonel Addison,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3400",1644,"Johnny Miller, Lord Sadler, and my enemy, the Honourable Baldock.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3401",1644,"They were of the same stamp all of them, drinkers, madcaps, fighters,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3402",1644,"gamblers, full of strange caprices and extraordinary whims. Yet they","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3403",1644,"were kindly fellows in their rough fashion, save only this Baldock, a","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3404",1644,"fat man, who prided himself on his skill at the box-fight. It was he","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3405",1644,"who, by his laughter against the French because they were ignorant","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3406",1644,"of sport, caused me to challenge him in the very sport at which he","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3407",1644,"excelled. You will say that it was foolish, my friends, but the decanter","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3408",1644,"had passed many times, and the blood of youth ran hot in my veins. I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3409",1644,"would fight him, this boaster; I would show him that if we had not skill","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3410",1644,"at least we had courage. Lord Rufton would not allow it. I insisted. The","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3411",1644,"others cheered me on and slapped me on the back. ""No, dash it, Baldock,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3412",1644,"he's our guest,"" said Rufton. ""It's his own doing,"" the other answered.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"3416",1644,"What the mawleys were I did not know, but presently they brought out","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3417",1644,"four great puddings of leather, not unlike a fencing glove, but larger.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3418",1644,"With these our hands were covered after we had stripped ourselves of","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3419",1644,"our coats and our waistcoats. Then the table, with the glasses and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"3424",1644,"I will confess to you, my friends, that I felt at that moment a tremor","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3425",1644,"such as none of my many duels have ever given me. With sword or pistol","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3426",1644,"I am at home, but here I only understood that I must struggle with this","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3427",1644,"fat Englishman and do what I could, in spite of these great puddings","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3428",1644,"upon my hands, to overcome him. And at the very outset I was disarmed","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3429",1644,"of the best weapon that was left to me. ""Mind, Gerard, no kicking!"" said","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3430",1644,"Lord Rufton in my ear. I had only a pair of thin dancing slippers, and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3431",1644,"yet the man was fat, and a few well-directed kicks might have left me","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3432",1644,"the victor. But there is an etiquette just as there is in fencing, and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3433",1644,"I refrained. I looked at this Englishman and I wondered how I should","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3434",1644,"attack him. His ears were large and prominent. Could I seize them I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3435",1644,"might drag him to the ground. I rushed in, but I was betrayed by this","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3436",1644,"flabby glove, and twice I lost my hold. He struck me, but I cared little","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3437",1644,"for his blows, and again I seized him by the ear. He fell, and I rolled","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"3452",1644,"He was flushed, and his small eyes were as vicious as those of a","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"3454",1644,"lightly and gaily. A French gentleman fights but he does not hate. I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"3460",1644,"round me. I fell upon my back. But in an instant I was on my feet again","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3461",1644,"and had rushed to a close combat. His ear, his hair, his nose, I seized","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"3462",1644,"them each in turn. Once again the mad joy of the battle was in my veins.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"5851",1644,"in the early morning, I observed with anxiety that not a single French","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6032",1644,"he saw me waiting and flew past me on my right. I lunged over my Arab's","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6033",1644,"neck and buried my toy sword in his side. It must have been the finest","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6034",1644,"steel and as sharp as a razor, for I hardly felt it enter, and yet his","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6035",1644,"blood was within three inches of the hilt. His horse galloped on and he","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6036",1644,"kept his saddle for a hundred yards before he sank down with his face on","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6037",1644,"the mane and then dived over the side of the neck on to the road. For my","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6038",1644,"own part I was already at his horse's heels. A few seconds had sufficed","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6039",1644,"for all that I have told.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6040",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6041",1644,"I heard the cry of rage and vengeance which rose from the Prussians as","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6043",1644,"what they could think of the Emperor as a horseman and a swordsman. I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6050",1644,"But I had a good lead and the brave Arab was still going well. I thought","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6051",1644,"that I was safe. And yet it was at that very instant that the most","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6052",1644,"terrible danger befell me. The lane divided, and I took the smaller of","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6053",1644,"the two divisions because it was the more grassy and the easier for the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6055",1644,"myself in a square of stables and farm-buildings, with no way out save","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6056",1644,"that by which I had come! Ah, my friends, if my hair is snowy white,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6057",1644,"have I not had enough to make it so?","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6059",1644,"To retreat was impossible. I could hear the thunder of the Prussians'","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6060",1644,"hoofs in the lane. I looked round me, and Nature has blessed me with","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6061",1644,"that quick eye which is the first of gifts to any soldier, but most of","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6062",1644,"all to a leader of cavalry. Between a long, low line of stables and the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6063",1644,"farm-house there was a pig-sty. Its front was made of bars of wood four","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6064",1644,"feet high; the back was of stone, higher than the front. What was beyond","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6065",1644,"I could not tell. The space between the front and the back was not more","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6066",1644,"than a few yards. It was a desperate venture, and yet I must take it.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6067",1644,"Every instant the beating of those hurrying hoofs was louder and louder.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6068",1644,"I put my Arab at the pig-sty. She cleared the front beautifully and came","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6069",1644,"down with her forefeet upon the sleeping pig within, slipping forward","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6070",1644,"upon her knees. I was thrown over the wall beyond, and fell upon my","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6071",1644,"hands and face in a soft flower-bed. My horse was upon one side of the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6072",1644,"wall, I upon the other, and the Prussians were pouring into the yard.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6073",1644,"But I was up in an instant and had seized the bridle of the plunging","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6075",1644,"dragged down a few of them to make a gap. As I tugged at the bridle and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6076",1644,"shouted the gallant creature rose to the leap, and an instant afterward","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6079",1644,"An heroic idea had entered my mind as I mounted into the saddle. These","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6080",1644,"Prussians, if they came over the pig-sty, could only come one at once,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6081",1644,"and their attack would not be formidable when they had not had time to","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6082",1644,"recover from such a leap. Why should I not wait and kill them one by","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6083",1644,"one as they came over? It was a glorious thought. They would learn that","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6084",1644,"Etienne Gerard was not a safe man to hunt. My hand felt for my sword,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6085",1644,"but you can imagine my feelings, my friends, when I came upon an empty","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6086",1644,"scabbard. It had been shaken out when the horse had tripped over that","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6087",1644,"infernal pig. On what absurd trifles do our destinies hang--a pig on one","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6088",1644,"side, Etienne Gerard on the other! Could I spring over the wall and get","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6089",1644,"the sword? Impossible! The Prussians were already in the yard. I turned","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6091",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6092",1644,"But for a moment it seemed to me that I was in a far worse trap than","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6093",1644,"before. I found myself in the garden of the farm-house, an orchard in","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6094",1644,"the centre and flower-beds all round. A high wall surrounded the whole","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6095",1644,"place. I reflected, however, that there must be some point of entrance,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6096",1644,"since every visitor could not be expected to spring over the pig-sty. I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6097",1644,"rode round the wall. As I expected, I came upon a door with a key upon","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6098",1644,"the inner side. I dismounted, unlocked it, opened it, and there was a","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6099",1644,"Prussian Lancer sitting his horse within six feet of me.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6100",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6101",1644,"For a moment we each stared at the other. Then I shut the door and","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6102",1644,"locked it again. A crash and a cry came from the other end of the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6103",1644,"garden. I understood that one of my enemies had come to grief in trying","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6104",1644,"to get over the pig-sty. How could I ever get out of this cul-de-sac?","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6105",1644,"It was evident that some of the party had galloped round, while some had","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6106",1644,"followed straight upon my tracks. Had I my sword I might have beaten off","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6107",1644,"the Lancer at the door, but to come out now was to be butchered. And","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6108",1644,"yet if I waited some of them would certainly follow me on foot over the","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6109",1644,"pig-sty, and what could I do then? I must act at once or I was lost. But","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6110",1644,"it is at such moments that my wits are most active and my actions most","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6111",1644,"prompt. Still leading my horse, I ran for a hundred yards by the side","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6112",1644,"of the wall away from the spot where the Lancer was watching. There I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6113",1644,"stopped, and with an effort I tumbled down several of the loose stones","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6114",1644,"from the top of the wall. The instant I had done so I hurried back to","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6115",1644,"the door. As I had expected, he thought I was making a gap for my escape","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6116",1644,"at that point, and I heard the thud of his horse's hoofs as he galloped","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6117",1644,"to cut me off. As I reached the gate I looked back, and I saw a","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6118",1644,"green-coated horseman, whom I knew to be Count Stein, clear the pig-sty","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6119",1644,"and gallop furiously with a shout of triumph across the garden.","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6120",1644,"","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6124",1644,"turned his horse. Springing upon my Arab's back, I was off once more","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6125",1644,"with a clear stretch of grass land before me. Stein had to dismount to","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6126",1644,"open the gate, to lead his horse through, and to mount again before he","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6131",1644,"look back, and then Stein was a musket-shot from me, and the Lancer","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6132",1644,"as much again, while only three of the others were in sight. My nine","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6138",1644,"their line of flight, and that I must edge more toward the east if I","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6139",1644,"wished to join them. Unless I did so it was probable that my pursuers,","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"6143",1644,"stretched for miles across the country. This was certainly the main road","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6144",1644,"along which our unhappy army was flying. But I soon had proof that","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6145",1644,"some of our stragglers had wandered into these side tracks, for I came","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"6146",1644,"suddenly upon a horse grazing at the corner of a field, and beside","The Adventures of Gerard","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
