"39",2865,"Few records remain to us of that dreadful period in our world's history,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"51",2865,"suffered in those dark middle ages; of how he saw both the good and the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"52",2865,"bad of men, and of how, by gentleness and love and not by strife and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"77",2865,"belonging to the castle--miserable serfs who, half timid, half fierce,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"78",2865,"tilled their poor patches of ground, wrenching from the hard soil barely","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"100",2865,"row upon row of windows, upon three sides of the bleak, stone courtyard.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1255",2865,"Three days had passed since the Baron had left the castle, and now the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1256",2865,"third night had come. The moon was hanging midway in the sky, white and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1261",2865,"white face of the moonlit rocks a band of some thirty men were creeping","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1262",2865,"slowly and stealthily nearer and nearer to Castle Drachenhausen. At the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1263",2865,"head of them was a tall, slender knight clad in light chain armor, his","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1289",2865,"great beams pierced the wall, and upon them the wooden tower rested. The","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1298",2865,"One of those who stood near handed the Baron a leathern pouch, the Baron","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1299",2865,"opened it and drew out a ball of fine thread, another of twine, a coil","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1300",2865,"of stout rope, and a great bundle that looked, until it was unrolled,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1301",2865,"like a coarse fish-net. It was a rope ladder. While these were being","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1302",2865,"made ready, Hans Schmidt, a thick-set, low-browed, broad-shouldered","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1303",2865,"archer, strung his stout bow, and carefully choosing three arrows","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1304",2865,"from those in his quiver, he stuck them point downward in the earth.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1305",2865,"Unwinding the ball of thread, he laid it loosely in large loops upon the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1306",2865,"ground so that it might run easily without hitching, then he tied the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1307",2865,"end of the thread tightly around one of his arrows. He fitted the arrow","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1308",2865,"to the bow and drew the feather to his ear. Twang! rang the bowstring,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1309",2865,"and the feathered messenger flew whistling upon its errand to the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1319",2865,"The rest was an easy task enough. First the twine was drawn up to and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1320",2865,"over the beam by the thread, then the rope was drawn up by the twine,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1321",2865,"and last of all the rope ladder by the rope. There it hung like a thin,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1329",2865,"A stout, young fellow, of about eighteen years of age, stepped forward","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1336",2865,"signal. When all is ready the others will follow thee. And now go and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"1339",2865,"The young fellow spat upon his hands and, seizing the ropes, began","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1340",2865,"slowly and carefully to mount the flimsy, shaking ladder. Those below","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1341",2865,"held it as tight as they were able, but nevertheless he swung backward","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1342",2865,"and forward and round and round as he climbed steadily upward. Once he","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1343",2865,"stopped upon the way, and those below saw him clutch the ladder close","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1344",2865,"to him as though dizzied by the height and the motion but he soon began","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1345",2865,"again, up, up, up like some great black spider. Presently he came out","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1346",2865,"from the black shadow below and into the white moonlight, and then his","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1347",2865,"shadow followed him step by step up the gray wall upon his way. At last","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1348",2865,"he reached the jutting beam, and there again he stopped for a moment","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1349",2865,"clutching tightly to it. The next he was upon the beam, dragging himself","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1350",2865,"toward the window of the bartizan just above. Slowly raising himself","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1351",2865,"upon his narrow foothold he peeped cautiously within. Those watching","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1352",2865,"him from be low saw him slip his hand softly to his side, and then place","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1353",2865,"something between his teeth. It was his dagger. Reaching up, he clutched","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1354",2865,"the window sill above him and, with a silent spring, seated himself","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1355",2865,"upon it. The next moment he disappeared within. A few seconds of silence","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1356",2865,"followed, then of sudden a sharp gurgling cry broke the stillness. There","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1357",2865,"was another pause of silence, then a faint shrill whistle sounded from","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1358",2865,"above.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1359",2865,"","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1360",2865,"""Who will go next?"" said the Baron. It was Hans Schmidt who stepped","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1361",2865,"forward. Another followed the arch up the ladder, and another, and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1362",2865,"another. Last of all went the Baron Henry himself, and nothing was left","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1363",2865,"but the rope ladder hanging from above, and swaying back and forth in","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1364",2865,"the wind.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1365",2865,"","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1366",2865,"That night Schwartz Carl had been bousing it over a pot of yellow wine","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1367",2865,"in the pantry with his old crony, Master Rudolph, the steward; and the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1368",2865,"two, chatting and gossiping together, had passed the time away until","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1369",2865,"long after the rest of the castle had been wrapped in sleep. Then,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1370",2865,"perhaps a little unsteady upon his feet, Schwartz Carl betook himself","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1371",2865,"homeward to the Melchior tower.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1372",2865,"","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1373",2865,"He stood for a while in the shadow of the doorway, gazing up into the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1374",2865,"pale sky above him at the great, bright, round moon, that hung like a","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1375",2865,"bubble above the sharp peaks of the roofs standing black as ink against","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1376",2865,"the sky. But all of a sudden he started up from the post against which","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1377",2865,"he had been leaning, and with head bent to one side, stood listening","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1378",2865,"breathlessly, for he too had heard that smothered cry from the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1379",2865,"watch-tower. So he stood intently, motionlessly, listening, listening;","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1380",2865,"but all was silent except for the monotonous dripping of water in one of","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1381",2865,"the nooks of the court-yard, and the distant murmur of the river borne","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1382",2865,"upon the breath of the night air. ""Mayhap I was mistaken,"" muttered","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1383",2865,"Schwartz Carl to himself.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1384",2865,"","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1385",2865,"But the next moment the silence was broken again by a faint, shrill","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1386",2865,"whistle; what did it mean?","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1387",2865,"","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1388",2865,"Back of the heavy oaken door of the tower was Schwartz Carl's cross-bow,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1389",2865,"the portable windlass with which the bowstring was drawn back, and a","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1390",2865,"pouch of bolts. Schwartz Carl reached back into the darkness, fumbling","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1391",2865,"in the gloom until his fingers met the weapon. Setting his foot in the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1392",2865,"iron stirrup at the end of the stock, he wound the stout bow-string","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1393",2865,"into the notch of the trigger, and carefully fitted the heavy,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1394",2865,"murderous-looking bolt into the groove.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1395",2865,"","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1396",2865,"Minute after minute passed, and Schwartz Carl, holding his arbelast in","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1397",2865,"his hand, stood silently waiting and watching in the sharp-cut, black","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1398",2865,"shadow of the doorway, motionless as a stone statue. Minute after minute","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1399",2865,"passed. Suddenly there was a movement in the shadow of the arch of the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1400",2865,"great gateway across the court-yard, and the next moment a leathern-clad","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1401",2865,"figure crept noiselessly out upon the moonlit pavement, and stood there","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1402",2865,"listening, his head bent to one side. Schwartz Carl knew very well","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1403",2865,"that it was no one belonging to the castle, and, from the nature of his","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1404",2865,"action, that he was upon no good errand.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1405",2865,"","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1406",2865,"He did not stop to challenge the suspicious stranger. The taking of","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1407",2865,"another's life was thought too small a matter for much thought or care","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1408",2865,"in those days. Schwartz Carl would have shot a man for a much smaller","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1409",2865,"reason than the suspicious actions of this fellow. The leather-clad","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1410",2865,"figure stood a fine target in the moonlight for a cross-bow bolt.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1411",2865,"Schwartz Carl slowly raised the weapon to his shoulder and took a long","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1412",2865,"and steady aim. Just then the stranger put his fingers to his lips and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1413",2865,"gave a low, shrill whistle. It was the last whistle that he was to give","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1414",2865,"upon this earth. There was a sharp, jarring twang of the bow-string, the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1415",2865,"hiss of the flying bolt, and the dull thud as it struck its mark. The","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1416",2865,"man gave a shrill, quavering cry, and went staggering back, and then","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1417",2865,"fell all of a heap against the wall behind him. As though in answer to","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1418",2865,"the cry, half a dozen men rushed tumultuously out from the shadow of","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1419",2865,"the gateway whence the stranger had just come, and then stood in the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1420",2865,"court-yard, looking uncertainly this way and that, not knowing from what","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1421",2865,"quarter the stroke had come that had laid their comrade low.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1422",2865,"","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"1423",2865,"But Schwartz Carl did not give them time to discover that; there was no","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2038",2865,"climbing and stood as still as a mouse, with his heart in his mouth.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2039",2865,"A few inches more and he would have been discovered;--what would have","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2044",2865,"gray light of the coming evening glimmered in a wide stone fireplace","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2046",2865,"the broad hearth, a great, fat woman and a shock-headed boy. The woman","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2047",2865,"held a spit with two newly trussed fowls upon it, so that One-eyed Hans","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2084",2865,"the boy was bending over the bundle of fagots, blowing the spark that","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2086",2865,"crackle and blaze. ""Now is my time,"" said Hans to himself. Bracing his","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2087",2865,"elbows against each side of the chimney, he straightened his legs so","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2088",2865,"that he might fall clear His motions loosened little shower of soot that","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2090",2865,"whereupon the boy raised his face and looked up. Hans loosened his hold","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2091",2865,"upon the chimney; crash! he fell, lighting upon his feet in the midst","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2092",2865,"of the burning fagots. The scullion boy tumbled backward upon the floor,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2093",2865,"where he lay upon the broad of his back with a face as white as","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2094",2865,"dough and eyes and mouth agape, staring speechlessly at the frightful","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2095",2865,"inky-black figure standing in the midst of the flames and smoke. Then","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2097",2865,"And thereupon, turning upon his side, he half rolled, half scrambled to","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2111",2865,"threw them upon the now blazing fagots, where they writhed and twisted","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2112",2865,"and wrinkled, and at last burst into a flame. Meanwhile Hans lost no","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2113",2865,"time; he must find a hiding-place, and quickly, if he would yet hope","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2114",2865,"to escape. A great bread trough stood in the corner of the kitchen--a","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2115",2865,"hopper-shaped chest with a flat lid. It was the best hiding place that","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2116",2865,"the room afforded. Without further thought Hans ran to it, snatching up","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2117",2865,"from the table as he passed a loaf of black bread and a bottle half full","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2118",2865,"of stale wine, for he had had nothing to eat since that morning. Into","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2119",2865,"the great bread trough he climbed, and drawing the lid down upon him,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2124",2865,"door was flung open and a tall, lean, lantern-jawed fellow, clad in","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2131",2865,"crackling fire throwing its cheerful ruddy glow upon the wall of the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2162",2865,"flight of stone steps. A man-at-arms in breast-plate and steel cap, and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2163",2865,"bearing a long pike, paced up and down the length of this gallery, now","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2181",2865,"leaning upon his spear. Had he looked down below he could not have","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2182",2865,"failed to have seen One-eyed Hans lying there motionlessly; but he was","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2183",2865,"gazing far away over the steep black roofs beyond, and never saw the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2202",2865,"shadow of the post and crept rapidly and stealthily after him. One step,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2209",2865,"fierce and silent struggle in the darkness, but strong and sturdy as the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2210",2865,"man was, he was no match for the almost superhuman strength of One-eyed","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2211",2865,"Hans. The cloth which he had flung over his head was tied tightly and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2213",2865,"fierce struggles, his arms were bound around and around with strong fine","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2214",2865,"cord; next his feet were bound in the same way, and the task was done.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2304",2865,"hempen rope tied in knots at short distances. He began unwinding the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2305",2865,"rope, and when he had done he was as thin as ever he had been before.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2306",2865,"Next he drew from the pouch that hung at his side a ball of fine cord","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2313",2865,"weight carried it downward toward the ground beneath. Suddenly the cord","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2314",2865,"stopped running. Hans jerked it and shook it, but it moved no farther.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2326",2865,"next moment the rope was drawn up to the window and down the outside by","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2334",2865,"climbing up to the window above. Winding his arm around the iron bars of","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2336",2865,"by his side, and drawing forth a file, fell to work cutting through all","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2341",2865,"black against the sky, bending over its work. Now and then the file","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2342",2865,"screeched against the hard iron, and then Hans would cease for a moment,","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2343",2865,"but only to begin again as industriously as ever. Three or four times he","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2344",2865,"tried the effects of his work, but still the iron held. At last he","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2345",2865,"set his shoulder against it, and as Otto looked he saw the iron bend.","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2346",2865,"Suddenly there was a sharp crack, and a piece of the grating went flying","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2462",2865,"iron-shod hoofs striking sparks of fire from the hard stones. At their","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2463",2865,"head rode Baron Henry; his triangular shield hung over his shoulder, and","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2464",2865,"in his hand he bore a long, heavy, steel-pointed lance with a pennant","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2534",2865,"a mile upon their pursuers when the helmeted heads rose above the crest","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2540",2865,"horses. Only once, when they crossed a shallow stretch of water, the","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2541",2865,"poor animals bent their heads and caught a few gulps from the cool","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2552",2865,"of the trees below, they caught the glint of armor of those who","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2691",2865,"clattering, and with a loud, inarticulate cry, grasped the mane of his","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2692",2865,"horse with both hands. Again the blade whistled in the air, and this","Otto of the Silver Hand","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
