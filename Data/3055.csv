"20",3055,"the sea which had to name Langton on Holm.   He was but of five and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"21",3055,"twenty winters, a fair-faced man, yellow-haired, tall and strong; rather","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"22",3055,"wiser than foolisher than young men are mostly wont; a valiant youth, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"23",3055,"a kind; not of many words but courteous of speech; no roisterer, nought","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"24",3055,"masterful, but peaceable and knowing how to forbear: in a fray a perilous","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"25",3055,"foe, and a trusty war-fellow.   His father, with whom he was dwelling","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"26",3055,"when this tale begins, was a great merchant, richer than a baron of the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"27",3055,"land, a head-man of the greatest of the Lineages of Langton, and a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"28",3055,"captain of the Porte; he was of the Lineage of the Goldings, therefore","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"29",3055,"was he called Bartholomew Golden, and his son Golden Walter.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"30",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"31",3055,"Now ye may well deem that such a youngling as this was looked upon by all","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"32",3055,"as a lucky man without a lack; but there was this flaw in his lot,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"33",3055,"whereas he had fallen into the toils of love of a woman exceeding fair,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"34",3055,"and had taken her to wife, she nought unwilling as it seemed.   But when","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"35",3055,"they had been wedded some six months he found by manifest tokens, that","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"36",3055,"his fairness was not so much to her but that she must seek to the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"37",3055,"foulness of one worser than he in all ways; wherefore his rest departed","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"38",3055,"from him, whereas he hated her for her untruth and her hatred of him; yet","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"39",3055,"would the sound of her voice, as she came and went in the house, make his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"40",3055,"heart beat; and the sight of her stirred desire within him, so that he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"41",3055,"longed for her to be sweet and kind with him, and deemed that, might it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"42",3055,"be so, he should forget all the evil gone by.   But it was not so; for","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"43",3055,"ever when she saw him, her face changed, and her hatred of him became","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"44",3055,"manifest, and howsoever she were sweet with others, with him she was hard","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"45",3055,"and sour.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"46",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"47",3055,"So this went on a while till the chambers of his father's house, yea the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"49",3055,"mind that the world was wide and he but a young man.   So on a day as he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"50",3055,"sat with his father alone, he spake to him and said: ""Father, I was on","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"51",3055,"the quays even now, and I looked on the ships that were nigh boun, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"52",3055,"thy sign I saw on a tall ship that seemed to me nighest boun.   Will it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"57",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"58",3055,"""The shortest word is best, father,"" said Walter, ""and this it is, that I","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"60",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"61",3055,"""Yea and whither, son?"" said the merchant.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"62",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"63",3055,"""Whither she goeth,"" said Walter, ""for I am ill at ease at home, as thou","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"65",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"66",3055,"The merchant held his peace awhile, and looked hard on his son, for there","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"67",3055,"was strong love between them; but at last he said: ""Well, son, maybe it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"72",3055,"""Well,"" said Bartholomew, ""at least I know on whom to lay the loss of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"73",3055,"thee, and when thou art gone, for thou shalt have thine own way herein,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"74",3055,"she shall no longer abide in my house.   Nay, but it were for the strife","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"75",3055,"that should arise thenceforth betwixt her kindred and ours, it should go","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"81",3055,"Bartholomew held his peace again for a while; then he said: ""Goeth she","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"83",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"84",3055,"Walter reddened, and said: ""I wot not; nor of whom the child may be.""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"85",3055,"Then they both sat silent, till Bartholomew spake, saying: ""The end of it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"86",3055,"is, son, that this is Monday, and that thou shalt go aboard in the small","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"87",3055,"hours of Wednesday; and meanwhile I shall look to it that thou go not","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"88",3055,"away empty-handed; the skipper of the Katherine is a good man and true,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"89",3055,"and knows the seas well; and my servant Robert the Low, who is clerk of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"106",3055,"When Walter went down to the Katherine next morning, there was the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"107",3055,"skipper Geoffrey, who did him reverence, and made him all cheer, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"108",3055,"showed him his room aboard ship, and the plenteous goods which his father","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"109",3055,"had sent down to the quays already, such haste as he had made.  Walter","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"110",3055,"thanked his father's love in his heart, but otherwise took little heed to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"111",3055,"his affairs, but wore away the time about the haven, gazing listlessly on","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"112",3055,"the ships that were making them ready outward, or unlading, and the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"113",3055,"mariners and aliens coming and going: and all these were to him as the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"114",3055,"curious images woven on a tapestry.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"115",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"116",3055,"At last when he had wellnigh come back again to the Katherine, he saw","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"117",3055,"there a tall ship, which he had scarce noted before, a ship all-boun,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"118",3055,"which had her boats out, and men sitting to the oars thereof ready to tow","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"119",3055,"her outwards when the hawser should be cast off, and by seeming her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"120",3055,"mariners were but abiding for some one or other to come aboard.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"121",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"122",3055,"So Walter stood idly watching the said ship, and as he looked, lo! folk","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"123",3055,"passing him toward the gangway.  These were three; first came a dwarf,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"124",3055,"dark-brown of hue and hideous, with long arms and ears exceeding great","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"125",3055,"and dog-teeth that stuck out like the fangs of a wild beast.  He was clad","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"126",3055,"in a rich coat of yellow silk, and bare in his hand a crooked bow, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"127",3055,"was girt with a broad sax.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"128",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"129",3055,"After him came a maiden, young by seeming, of scarce twenty summers; fair","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"130",3055,"of face as a flower; grey-eyed, brown-haired, with lips full and red,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"131",3055,"slim and gentle of body.  Simple was her array, of a short and strait","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"132",3055,"green gown, so that on her right ankle was clear to see an iron ring.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"133",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"134",3055,"Last of the three was a lady, tall and stately, so radiant of visage and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"135",3055,"glorious of raiment, that it were hard to say what like she was; for","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"136",3055,"scarce might the eye gaze steady upon her exceeding beauty; yet must","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"137",3055,"every son of Adam who found himself anigh her, lift up his eyes again","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"138",3055,"after he had dropped them, and look again on her, and yet again and yet","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"139",3055,"again.  Even so did Walter, and as the three passed by him, it seemed to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"140",3055,"him as if all the other folk there about had vanished and were nought;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"141",3055,"nor had he any vision before his eyes of any looking on them, save","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"142",3055,"himself alone.  They went over the gangway into the ship, and he saw them","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"143",3055,"go along the deck till they came to the house on the poop, and entered it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"144",3055,"and were gone from his sight.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"145",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"146",3055,"There he stood staring, till little by little the thronging people of the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"147",3055,"quays came into his eye-shot again; then he saw how the hawser was cast","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"148",3055,"off and the boats fell to tugging the big ship toward the harbour-mouth","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"149",3055,"with hale and how of men.  Then the sail fell down from the yard and was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"150",3055,"sheeted home and filled with the fair wind as the ship's bows ran up on","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"151",3055,"the first green wave outside the haven.  Even therewith the shipmen cast","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"152",3055,"abroad a banner, whereon was done in a green field a grim wolf ramping up","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"153",3055,"against a maiden, and so went the ship upon her way.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"154",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"155",3055,"Walter stood awhile staring at her empty place where the waves ran into","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"156",3055,"the haven-mouth, and then turned aside and toward the Katherine; and at","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"157",3055,"first he was minded to go ask shipmaster Geoffrey of what he knew","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"158",3055,"concerning the said ship and her alien wayfarers; but then it came into","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"159",3055,"his mind, that all this was but an imagination or dream of the day, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"160",3055,"that he were best to leave it untold to any.  So therewith he went his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"161",3055,"way from the water-side, and through the streets unto his father's house;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"162",3055,"but when he was but a little way thence, and the door was before him, him-","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"163",3055,"seemed for a moment of time that he beheld those three coming out down","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"164",3055,"the steps of stone and into the street; to wit the dwarf, the maiden, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"165",3055,"the stately lady: but when he stood still to abide their coming, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"166",3055,"looked toward them, lo! there was nothing before him save the goodly","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"167",3055,"house of Bartholomew Golden, and three children and a cur dog playing","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"168",3055,"about the steps thereof, and about him were four or five passers-by going","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"169",3055,"about their business.  Then was he all confused in his mind, and knew not","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"170",3055,"what to make of it, whether those whom he had seemed to see pass aboard","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"171",3055,"ship were but images of a dream, or children of Adam in very flesh.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"172",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"173",3055,"Howsoever, he entered the house, and found his father in the chamber, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"174",3055,"fell to speech with him about their matters; but for all that he loved","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"175",3055,"his father, and worshipped him as a wise and valiant man, yet at that","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"176",3055,"hour he might not hearken the words of his mouth, so much was his mind","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"177",3055,"entangled in the thought of those three, and they were ever before his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"178",3055,"eyes, as if they had been painted on a table by the best of limners.  And","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"179",3055,"of the two women he thought exceeding much, and cast no wyte upon himself","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"180",3055,"for running after the desire of strange women.  For he said to himself","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"181",3055,"that he desired not either of the twain; nay, he might not tell which of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"182",3055,"the twain, the maiden or the stately queen, were clearest to his eyes;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"183",3055,"but sore he desired to see both of them again, and to know what they","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"184",3055,"were.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"185",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"186",3055,"So wore the hours till the Wednesday morning, and it was time that he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"187",3055,"should bid farewell to his father and get aboard ship; but his father led","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"188",3055,"him down to the quays and on to the Katherine, and there Walter embraced","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"189",3055,"him, not without tears and forebodings; for his heart was full.  Then","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"190",3055,"presently the old man went aland; the gangway was unshipped, the hawsers","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"191",3055,"cast off; the oars of the towing-boats splashed in the dark water, the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"192",3055,"sail fell down from the yard, and was sheeted home, and out plunged the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"193",3055,"Katherine into the misty sea and rolled up the grey slopes, casting","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"194",3055,"abroad her ancient withal, whereon was beaten the token of Bartholomew","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"195",3055,"Golden, to wit a B and a G to the right and the left, and thereabove a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"197",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"198",3055,"Walter stood on the stern and beheld, yet more with the mind of him than","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"199",3055,"with his eyes; for it all seemed but the double of what the other ship","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"200",3055,"had done; and the thought of it as if the twain were as beads strung on","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"340",3055,"think no more of the vision of those three, but would fare back to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"341",3055,"Langton, and enter into the strife with the Reddings and quell them, or","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"342",3055,"die else.  But lo, when he was quite steady in this doom, and his heart","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"345",3055,"now he was thinking and devising if by any means he might find out in","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"346",3055,"what land dwelt those three.  And then again he strove to put that from","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"347",3055,"him, saying that what he had seen was but meet for one brainsick, and a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"348",3055,"dreamer of dreams.  But furthermore he thought, Yea, and was Arnold, who","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"349",3055,"this last time had seen the images of those three, a dreamer of waking","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"350",3055,"dreams? for he was nought wonted in such wise; then thought he: At least","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"351",3055,"I am well content that he spake to me of their likeness, not I to him;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"352",3055,"for so I may tell that there was at least something before my eyes which","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"358",3055,"bestirred him, and saw to the trussing up of his goods, and made all","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"380",3055,"on sea and sky, and then turned and bade the mariners take in sail and be","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"381",3055,"right heedful.  And when Walter asked him what he looked for, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"389",3055,"whipping of ropes, and thunder of flapping sails, and the tossing and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"390",3055,"weltering of the ship withal.  But, being a very stout-hearted young man,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"828",3055,"fail to see them hence as they go on their ways to thine house.  And it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"829",3055,"may be well that I be at hand to command them and forbid, and put some","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"830",3055,"order amongst them, for rough playmates they be, some of them, and now","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"831",3055,"all heated with the hunting and the joy of the green earth.""  Thus he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"832",3055,"spoke, as if nought were toward save supper and bed; but inwardly hope","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"833",3055,"and fear were contending in him, and again his heart beat so hard, that","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"834",3055,"he deemed that the carle must surely hear it.  But the old man took him","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"835",3055,"but according to his outward seeming, and nodded his head, and went away","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"836",3055,"quietly toward his house.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"838",3055,"When he had been gone a little, Walter rose up heedfully; he had with him","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"839",3055,"a scrip wherein was some cheese and hard-fish, and a little flasket of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"840",3055,"wine; a short bow he had with him, and a quiver of arrows; and he was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"841",3055,"girt with a strong and good sword, and a wood-knife withal.  He looked to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"842",3055,"all this gear that it was nought amiss, and then speedily went down off","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"843",3055,"the mound, and when he was come down, he found that it covered him from","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"844",3055,"men coming out of the wood, if he went straight thence to that shard of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"846",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"847",3055,"Now it is no nay that thitherward he turned, and went wisely, lest the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"848",3055,"carle should make a backward cast, and see him, or lest any straggler of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"849",3055,"his own folk might happen upon him.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"850",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"851",3055,"For to say sooth, he deemed that did they wind him, they would be like to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"852",3055,"let him of his journey.  He had noted the bearings of the cliffs nigh the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"853",3055,"shard, and whereas he could see their heads everywhere except from the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"854",3055,"depths of the thicket, he was not like to go astray.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"855",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"856",3055,"He had made no great way ere he heard the horns blowing all together","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"857",3055,"again in one place, and looking thitherward through the leafy boughs (for","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"858",3055,"he was now amidst of a thicket) he saw his men thronging the mound, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"859",3055,"had no doubt therefore that they were blowing on him; but being well","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"860",3055,"under cover he heeded it nought, and lying still a little, saw them go","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"861",3055,"down off the mound and go all of them toward the carle's house, still","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"862",3055,"blowing as they went, but not faring scatter-meal.  Wherefore it was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"864",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"865",3055,"So he went on his way to the shard; and there is nothing to say of his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"866",3055,"journey till he got before it with the last of the clear day, and entered","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"867",3055,"it straightway.  It was in sooth a downright breach or cleft in the rock-","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"868",3055,"wall, and there was no hill or bent leading up to it, nothing but a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"869",3055,"tumble of stones before it, which was somewhat uneasy going, yet needed","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"870",3055,"nought but labour to overcome it, and when he had got over this, and was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"871",3055,"in the very pass itself, he found it no ill going: forsooth at first it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"872",3055,"was little worse than a rough road betwixt two great stony slopes, though","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"873",3055,"a little trickle of water ran down amidst of it.  So, though it was so","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"874",3055,"nigh nightfall, yet Walter pressed on, yea, and long after the very night","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"875",3055,"was come.  For the moon rose wide and bright a little after nightfall.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"876",3055,"But at last he had gone so long, and was so wearied, that he deemed it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"877",3055,"nought but wisdom to rest him, and so lay down on a piece of greensward","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"878",3055,"betwixt the stones, when he had eaten a morsel out of his satchel, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"879",3055,"drunk of the water out of the stream.  There as he lay, if he had any","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"880",3055,"doubt of peril, his weariness soon made it all one to him, for presently","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"881",3055,"he was sleeping as soundly as any man in Langton on Holm.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"891",3055,"pool thereof, and then set forth on his way again.  When he had gone some","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"892",3055,"three hours, the road, which had been going up all the way, but somewhat","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"893",3055,"gently, grew steeper, and the bent on either side lowered, and lowered,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"894",3055,"till it sank at last altogether, and then was he on a rough mountain-neck","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"895",3055,"with little grass, and no water; save that now and again was a soft place","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"896",3055,"with a flow amidst of it, and such places he must needs fetch a compass","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"897",3055,"about, lest he be mired.  He gave himself but little rest, eating what he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"898",3055,"needs must as he went.  The day was bright and calm, so that the sun was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"899",3055,"never hidden, and he steered by it due south.  All that day he went, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"900",3055,"found no more change in that huge neck, save that whiles it was more and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"901",3055,"whiles less steep.  A little before nightfall he happened on a shallow","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"902",3055,"pool some twenty yards over; and he deemed it good to rest there, since","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"903",3055,"there was water for his avail, though he might have made somewhat more","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"910",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"911",3055,"All this while he had seen no four-footed beast, save now and again a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"912",3055,"hill-fox, and once some outlandish kind of hare; and of fowl but very","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"913",3055,"few: a crow or two, a long-winged hawk, and twice an eagle high up aloft.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"914",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"915",3055,"Again, the third night, he slept in the stony wilderness, which still led","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"916",3055,"him up and up.  Only toward the end of the day, himseemed that it had","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"917",3055,"been less steep for a long while: otherwise nought was changed, on all","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"918",3055,"sides it was nought but the endless neck, wherefrom nought could be seen,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"919",3055,"but some other part of itself.  This fourth night withal he found no","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"920",3055,"water whereby he might rest, so that he awoke parched, and longing to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"924",3055,"had been going wearily a long while, and now, hard on noontide, his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"925",3055,"thirst grieved him sorely, he came on a spring welling out from under a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"926",3055,"high rock, the water wherefrom trickled feebly away.  So eager was he to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"927",3055,"drink, that at first he heeded nought else; but when his thirst was fully","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"928",3055,"quenched his eyes caught sight of the stream which flowed from the well,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"929",3055,"and he gave a shout, for lo! it was running south.  Wherefore it was with","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"930",3055,"a merry heart that he went on, and as he went, came on more streams, all","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"931",3055,"running south or thereabouts.  He hastened on all he might, but in","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"932",3055,"despite of all the speed he made, and that he felt the land now going","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"933",3055,"down southward, night overtook him in that same wilderness.  Yet when he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"934",3055,"stayed at last for sheer weariness, he lay down in what he deemed by the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"935",3055,"moonlight to be a shallow valley, with a ridge at the southern end","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"936",3055,"thereof.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"937",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"940",3055,"arose and ate of what little was yet left him, and drank of the water of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"941",3055,"a stream which he had followed the evening before, and beside which he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"942",3055,"had laid him down; and then set forth again with no great hope to come on","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"943",3055,"new tidings that day.  But yet when he was fairly afoot, himseemed that","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"944",3055,"there was something new in the air which he breathed, that was soft and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"945",3055,"bore sweet scents home to him; whereas heretofore, and that especially","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"946",3055,"for the last three or four days, it had been harsh and void, like the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"947",3055,"face of the desert itself.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"948",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"949",3055,"So on he went, and presently was mounting the ridge aforesaid, and, as","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"950",3055,"oft happens when one climbs a steep place, he kept his eyes on the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"951",3055,"ground, till he felt he was on the top of the ridge.  Then he stopped to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"952",3055,"take breath, and raised his head and looked, and lo! he was verily on the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"953",3055,"brow of the great mountain-neck, and down below him was the hanging of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"954",3055,"the great hill-slopes, which fell down, not slowly, as those he had been","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"955",3055,"those days a-mounting, but speedily enough, though with little of broken","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"956",3055,"places or sheer cliffs.  But beyond this last of the desert there was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"957",3055,"before him a lovely land of wooded hills, green plains, and little","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"958",3055,"valleys, stretching out far and wide, till it ended at last in great blue","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"960",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"961",3055,"Then for very surprise of joy his spirit wavered, and he felt faint and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"962",3055,"dizzy, so that he was fain to sit down a while and cover his face with","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"963",3055,"his hands.  Presently he came to his sober mind again, and stood up and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"964",3055,"looked forth keenly, and saw no sign of any dwelling of man.  But he said","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"965",3055,"to himself that that might well be because the good and well-grassed land","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"966",3055,"was still so far off, and that he might yet look to find men and their","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"967",3055,"dwellings when he had left the mountain wilderness quite behind him: So","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"968",3055,"therewith he fell to going his ways down the mountain, and lost little","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"979",3055,"peril of them, and again for bogs impassable, he was fully three days","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"980",3055,"more before he had quite come out of the stony waste, and by that time,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"981",3055,"though he had never lacked water, his scanty victual was quite done, for","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"982",3055,"all his careful husbandry thereof.  But this troubled him little, whereas","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"983",3055,"he looked to find wild fruits here and there and to shoot some small","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"984",3055,"deer, as hare or coney, and make a shift to cook the same, since he had","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"985",3055,"with him flint and fire-steel.  Moreover the further he went, the surer","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"986",3055,"he was that he should soon come across a dwelling, so smooth and fair as","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"987",3055,"everything looked before him.  And he had scant fear, save that he might","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"988",3055,"happen on men who should enthrall him.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"989",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"990",3055,"But when he was come down past the first green slopes, he was so worn,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"991",3055,"that he said to himself that rest was better than meat, so little as he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"992",3055,"had slept for the last three days; so he laid him down under an ash-tree","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"993",3055,"by a stream-side, nor asked what was o'clock, but had his fill of sleep,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"994",3055,"and even when he awoke in the fresh morning was little fain of rising,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"995",3055,"but lay betwixt sleeping and waking for some three hours more; then he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"996",3055,"arose, and went further down the next green bent, yet somewhat slowly","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"997",3055,"because of his hunger-weakness.  And the scent of that fair land came up","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"999",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1000",3055,"So he came to where the land was level, and there were many trees, as oak","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1001",3055,"and ash, and sweet-chestnut and wych-elm, and hornbeam and quicken-tree,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1002",3055,"not growing in a close wood or tangled thicket, but set as though in","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1003",3055,"order on the flowery greensward, even as it might be in a great king's","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1007",3055,"with fruit: his belly rejoiced at the sight, and he caught hold of a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1008",3055,"bough, and fell to plucking and eating.  But whiles he was amidst of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1010",3055,"braying, not very great, but exceeding fierce and terrible, and not like","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1011",3055,"to the voice of any beast that he knew.  As has been aforesaid, Walter","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1013",3055,"what with the strangeness of his adventure and his loneliness, his spirit","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1015",3055,"trembled: this way and that he looked, and then gave a great cry and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1016",3055,"tumbled down in a swoon; for close before him, at his very feet, was the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1099",3055,"coming of night, when he laid him down under a great spreading oak with","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1100",3055,"his drawn sword ready to hand, and fell asleep at once, and woke not till","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1104",3055,"yesterday; but even better, it might be; the greensward more flowery, the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1105",3055,"oaks and chestnuts greater.  Deer of diverse kinds he saw, and might","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1106",3055,"easily have got his meat thereof; but he meddled not with them since he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1107",3055,"had his bread, and was timorous of lighting a fire.  Withal he doubted","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1108",3055,"little of having some entertainment; and that, might be, nought evil;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1109",3055,"since even that fearful dwarf had been courteous to him after his kind,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1110",3055,"and had done him good and not harm.  But of the happening on the Wretch","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1111",3055,"and the Thing, whereof the dwarf spake, he was yet somewhat afeard.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1112",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1113",3055,"After he had gone a while and whenas the summer morn was at its","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1114",3055,"brightest, he saw a little way ahead a grey rock rising up from amidst of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1115",3055,"a ring of oak-trees; so he turned thither straightway; for in this plain-","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1116",3055,"land he had seen no rocks heretofore; and as he went he saw that there","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1117",3055,"was a fountain gushing out from under the rock, which ran thence in a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1118",3055,"fair little stream.  And when he had the rock and the fountain and the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1119",3055,"stream clear before him, lo! a child of Adam sitting beside the fountain","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1120",3055,"under the shadow of the rock.  He drew a little nigher, and then he saw","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1121",3055,"that it was a woman, clad in green like the sward whereon she lay.  She","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1122",3055,"was playing with the welling out of the water, and she had trussed up her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1123",3055,"sleeves to the shoulder that she might thrust her bare arms therein.  Her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1124",3055,"shoes of black leather lay on the grass beside her, and her feet and legs","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1125",3055,"yet shone with the brook.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1126",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1127",3055,"Belike amidst the splashing and clatter of the water she did not hear him","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1129",3055,"and saw him, and he beheld her, that it was the maiden of the thrice-seen","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1130",3055,"pageant.  She reddened when she saw him, and hastily covered up her legs","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1131",3055,"with her gown-skirt, and drew down the sleeves over her arms, but","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1132",3055,"otherwise stirred not.  As for him, he stood still, striving to speak to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1149",3055,"Said Walter: ""I wot not; but the other man seemed to be looking for me,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1154",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1160",3055,"head aback, and beat the air with her hands; but said presently in a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1161",3055,"faint voice: ""I pray thee talk not of that one while I am by, nor even","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1164",3055,"He spake not, and she was a little while before she came to herself","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1165",3055,"again; then she opened her eyes, and looked upon Walter and smiled kindly","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1166",3055,"on him, as though to ask his pardon for having scared him.  Then she rose","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1167",3055,"up in her place, and stood before him; and they were nigh together, for","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1417",3055,"wherein they stood all done with gold and fair hues.  Gay were the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1418",3055,"windows of the house; and there was a pillared porch before the great","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1419",3055,"door, with images betwixt the pillars both of men and beasts: and when","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1420",3055,"Walter looked up to the roof of the house, he saw that it gleamed and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1421",3055,"shone; for all the tiles were of yellow metal, which he deemed to be of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1422",3055,"very gold.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1423",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1424",3055,"All this he saw as he went, and tarried not to gaze upon it; for he said,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1425",3055,"Belike there will be time for me to look on all this before I die.  But","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1426",3055,"he said also, that, though the house was not of the greatest, it was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1427",3055,"beyond compare of all houses of the world.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1428",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1429",3055,"Now he entered it by the porch, and came into a hall many-pillared, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1430",3055,"vaulted over, the walls painted with gold and ultramarine, the floor","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1431",3055,"dark, and spangled with many colours, and the windows glazed with knots","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1432",3055,"and pictures.  Midmost thereof was a fountain of gold, whence the water","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1433",3055,"ran two ways in gold-lined runnels, spanned twice with little bridges of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1434",3055,"silver.  Long was that hall, and now not very light, so that Walter was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1435",3055,"come past the fountain before he saw any folk therein: then he looked up","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1436",3055,"toward the high-seat, and himseemed that a great light shone thence, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1437",3055,"dazzled his eyes; and he went on a little way, and then fell on his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1438",3055,"knees; for there before him on the high-seat sat that wondrous Lady,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1439",3055,"whose lively image had been shown to him thrice before; and she was clad","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1440",3055,"in gold and jewels, as he had erst seen her.  But now she was not alone;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1441",3055,"for by her side sat a young man, goodly enough, so far as Walter might","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1442",3055,"see him, and most richly clad, with a jewelled sword by his side, and a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1443",3055,"chaplet of gems on his head.  They held each other by the hand, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1444",3055,"seemed to be in dear converse together; but they spake softly, so that","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1445",3055,"Walter might not hear what they said, till at last the man spake aloud to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1446",3055,"the Lady: ""Seest thou not that there is a man in the hall?""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1447",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1448",3055,"""Yea,"" she said, ""I see him yonder, kneeling on his knees; let him come","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1449",3055,"nigher and give some account of himself.""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1450",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1451",3055,"So Walter stood up and drew nigh, and stood there, all shamefaced and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1452",3055,"confused, looking on those twain, and wondering at the beauty of the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1453",3055,"Lady.  As for the man, who was slim, and black-haired, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1454",3055,"straight-featured, for all his goodliness Walter accounted him little,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1455",3055,"and nowise deemed him to look chieftain-like.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1456",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1457",3055,"Now the Lady spake not to Walter any more than erst; but at last the man","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1458",3055,"said: ""Why doest thou not kneel as thou didst erewhile?""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1459",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1460",3055,"Walter was on the point of giving him back a fierce answer; but the Lady","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1461",3055,"spake and said: ""Nay, friend, it matters not whether he kneel or stand;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1462",3055,"but he may say, if he will, what he would have of me, and wherefore he is","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1463",3055,"come hither.""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1464",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1465",3055,"Then spake Walter, for as wroth and ashamed as he was: ""Lady, I have","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1466",3055,"strayed into this land, and have come to thine house as I suppose, and if","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1467",3055,"I be not welcome, I may well depart straightway, and seek a way out of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1468",3055,"thy land, if thou wouldst drive me thence, as well as out of thine","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1469",3055,"house.""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1470",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1471",3055,"Thereat the Lady turned and looked on him, and when her eyes met his, he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1472",3055,"felt a pang of fear and desire mingled shoot through his heart.  This","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1473",3055,"time she spoke to him; but coldly, without either wrath or any thought of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1474",3055,"him: ""Newcomer,"" she said, ""I have not bidden thee hither; but here mayst","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1475",3055,"thou abide a while if thou wilt; nevertheless, take heed that here is no","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1476",3055,"King's Court.  There is, forsooth, a folk that serveth me (or, it may be,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1477",3055,"more than one), of whom thou wert best to know nought.  Of others I have","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1478",3055,"but two servants, whom thou wilt see; and the one is a strange creature,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1479",3055,"who should scare thee or scathe thee with a good will, but of a good will","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1480",3055,"shall serve nought save me; the other is a woman, a thrall, of little","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1481",3055,"avail, save that, being compelled, she will work woman's service for me,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1482",3055,"but whom none else shall compel . . . Yea, but what is all this to thee;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1483",3055,"or to me that I should tell it to thee?  I will not drive thee away; but","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1484",3055,"if thine entertainment please thee not, make no plaint thereof to me, but","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1485",3055,"depart at thy will.  Now is this talk betwixt us overlong, since, as thou","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1486",3055,"seest, I and this King's Son are in converse together.  Art thou a King's","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1487",3055,"Son?""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1488",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1489",3055,"""Nay, Lady,"" said Walter, ""I am but of the sons of the merchants.""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1490",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1491",3055,"""It matters not,"" she said; ""go thy ways into one of the chambers.""","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1492",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1493",3055,"And straightway she fell a-talking to the man who sat beside her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1494",3055,"concerning the singing of the birds beneath her window in the morning;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1495",3055,"and of how she had bathed her that day in a pool of the woodlands, when","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1496",3055,"she had been heated with hunting, and so forth; and all as if there had","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1497",3055,"been none there save her and the King's Son.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1498",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1499",3055,"But Walter departed all ashamed, as though he had been a poor man thrust","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1500",3055,"away from a rich kinsman's door; and he said to himself that this woman","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1501",3055,"was hateful, and nought love-worthy, and that she was little like to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1502",3055,"tempt him, despite all the fairness of her body.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1503",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1504",3055,"No one else he saw in the house that even; he found meat and drink duly","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1505",3055,"served on a fair table, and thereafter he came on a goodly bed, and all","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1506",3055,"things needful, but no child of Adam to do him service, or bid him","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1507",3055,"welcome or warning.  Nevertheless he ate, and drank, and slept, and put","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1508",3055,"off thought of all these things till the morrow, all the more as he hoped","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1509",3055,"to see the kind maiden some time betwixt sunrise and sunset on that new","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1517",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1518",3055,"He arose betimes, but found no one to greet him, neither was there any","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1519",3055,"sound of folk moving within the fair house; so he but broke his fast, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1520",3055,"then went forth and wandered amongst the trees, till he found him a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1521",3055,"stream to bathe in, and after he had washed the night off him he lay down","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1522",3055,"under a tree thereby for a while, but soon turned back toward the house,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1523",3055,"lest perchance the Maid should come thither and he should miss her.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1524",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1525",3055,"It should be said that half a bow-shot from the house on that side (i.e.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1526",3055,"due north thereof) was a little hazel-brake, and round about it the trees","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1527",3055,"were smaller of kind than the oaks and chestnuts he had passed through","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1528",3055,"before, being mostly of birch and quicken-beam and young ash, with small","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1529",3055,"wood betwixt them; so now he passed through the thicket, and, coming to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1530",3055,"the edge thereof, beheld the Lady and the King's Son walking together","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1531",3055,"hand in hand, full lovingly by seeming.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1532",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1533",3055,"He deemed it unmeet to draw back and hide him, so he went forth past them","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1534",3055,"toward the house.  The King's Son scowled on him as he passed, but the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1535",3055,"Lady, over whose beauteous face flickered the joyous morning smiles, took","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1536",3055,"no more heed of him than if he had been one of the trees of the wood.  But","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1537",3055,"she had been so high and disdainful with him the evening before, that he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1538",3055,"thought little of that.  The twain went on, skirting the hazel-copse, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1539",3055,"he could not choose but turn his eyes on them, so sorely did the Lady's","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1540",3055,"beauty draw them.  Then befell another thing; for behind them the boughs","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1541",3055,"of the hazels parted, and there stood that little evil thing, he or","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1542",3055,"another of his kind; for he was quite unclad, save by his fell of yellowy-","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1543",3055,"brown hair, and that he was girt with a leathern girdle, wherein was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1544",3055,"stuck an ugly two-edged knife: he stood upright a moment, and cast his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1545",3055,"eyes at Walter and grinned, but not as if he knew him; and scarce could","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1546",3055,"Walter say whether it were the one he had seen, or another: then he cast","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1547",3055,"himself down on his belly, and fell to creeping through the long grass","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1548",3055,"like a serpent, following the footsteps of the Lady and her lover; and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1549",3055,"now, as he crept, Walter deemed, in his loathing, that the creature was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1550",3055,"liker to a ferret than aught else.  He crept on marvellous swiftly, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1551",3055,"was soon clean out of sight.  But Walter stood staring after him for a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1552",3055,"while, and then lay down by the copse-side, that he might watch the house","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1553",3055,"and the entry thereof; for he thought, now perchance presently will the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1554",3055,"kind maiden come hither to comfort me with a word or two.  But hour","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1555",3055,"passed by hour, and still she came not; and still he lay there, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1556",3055,"thought of the Maid, and longed for her kindness and wisdom, till he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1557",3055,"could not refrain his tears, and wept for the lack of her.  Then he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1558",3055,"arose, and went and sat in the porch, and was very downcast of mood.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1559",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1560",3055,"But as he sat there, back comes the Lady again, the King's Son leading","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1561",3055,"her by the hand; they entered the porch, and she passed by him so close","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1562",3055,"that the odour of her raiment filled all the air about him, and the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1563",3055,"sleekness of her side nigh touched him, so that he could not fail to note","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1564",3055,"that her garments were somewhat disarrayed, and that she kept her right","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1565",3055,"hand (for her left the King's Son held) to her bosom to hold the cloth","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1566",3055,"together there, whereas the rich raiment had been torn off from her right","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1567",3055,"shoulder.  As they passed by him, the King's Son once more scowled on","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1568",3055,"him, wordless, but even more fiercely than before; and again the Lady","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1569",3055,"heeded him nought.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1570",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1571",3055,"After they had gone on a while, he entered the hall, and found it empty","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1572",3055,"from end to end, and no sound in it save the tinkling of the fountain;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1573",3055,"but there was victual set on the board.  He ate and drank thereof to keep","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1574",3055,"life lusty within him, and then went out again to the wood-side to watch","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1575",3055,"and to long; and the time hung heavy on his hands because of the lack of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1579",3055,"sleep under the boughs of the forest.  But a little after sunset he saw a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1580",3055,"bright-clad image moving amidst the carven images of the porch, and the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1581",3055,"King's Son came forth and went straight to him, and said: ""Thou art to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1582",3055,"enter the house, and go into thy chamber forthwith, and by no means to go","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1583",3055,"forth of it betwixt sunset and sunrise.  My Lady will not away with thy","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1587",3055,"followed him soberly, remembering how the Maid had bidden him forbear.  So","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1588",3055,"he went to his chamber, and slept.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1589",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1590",3055,"But amidst of the night he awoke and deemed that he heard a voice not far","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1591",3055,"off, so he crept out of his bed and peered around, lest, perchance, the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1592",3055,"Maid had come to speak with him; but his chamber was dusk and empty: then","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1593",3055,"he went to the window and looked out, and saw the moon shining bright and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1594",3055,"white upon the greensward.  And lo! the Lady walking with the King's Son,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1595",3055,"and he clad in thin and wanton raiment, but she in nought else save what","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1596",3055,"God had given her of long, crispy yellow hair.  Then was Walter ashamed","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1597",3055,"to look on her, seeing that there was a man with her, and gat him back to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1598",3055,"his bed; but yet a long while ere he slept again he had the image before","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1599",3055,"his eyes of the fair woman on the dewy moonlit grass.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1601",3055,"The next day matters went much the same way, and the next also, save that","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1603",3055,"the fourth day also the forenoon wore as erst; but in the heat of the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1604",3055,"afternoon Walter sought to the hazel-copse, and laid him down there hard","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1605",3055,"by a little clearing thereof, and slept from very weariness of grief.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1606",3055,"There, after a while, he woke with words still hanging in his ears, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1896",3055,"As they went, they found a change in the land, which grew emptier of big","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1897",3055,"and wide-spreading trees, and more beset with thickets.  From one of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1898",3055,"these they roused a hart, and Walter let slip his hounds thereafter and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1899",3055,"he and the Lady followed running.  Exceeding swift was she, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1900",3055,"well-breathed withal, so that Walter wondered at her; and eager she was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1901",3055,"in the chase as the very hounds, heeding nothing the scratching of briars","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1903",3055,"hunting, the quarry outran both dogs and folk, and gat him into a great","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1904",3055,"thicket, amidmost whereof was a wide plash of water.  Into the thicket","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1905",3055,"they followed him, but he took to the water under their eyes and made","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1906",3055,"land on the other side; and because of the tangle of underwood, he swam","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1907",3055,"across much faster than they might have any hope to come round on him;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2086",3055,"body swaying and tottering, her hands hanging down, and the bow and arrow","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2087",3055,"fallen to the ground; and ten yards before her a great-headed yellow","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2091",3055,"another hung loose to the lesser fingers of his string-hand.  He raised","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2092",3055,"his right hand, and drew and loosed in a twinkling; the shaft flew close","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2094",3055,"as the yellow lion turned about to bite at the shaft which had sunk deep","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2095",3055,"into him behind the shoulder, as if a bolt out of the heavens had smitten","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2096",3055,"him.  But straightway had Walter loosed again, and then, throwing down","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2097",3055,"his bow, he ran forward with his drawn sword gleaming in his hand, while","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2099",3055,"Walter went up to him warily and thrust him through to the heart, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2101",3055,"left his struggling, his huge voice died out, and he lay there moveless","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2106",3055,"huddled up and voiceless.  So he knelt down by her, and lifted up her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2107",3055,"head, and bade her arise, for the foe was slain.  And after a little she","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2108",3055,"stretched out her limbs, and turned about on the grass, and seemed to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2109",3055,"sleep, and the colour came into her face again, and it grew soft and a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2110",3055,"little smiling.  Thus she lay awhile, and Walter sat by her watching her,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2111",3055,"till at last she opened her eyes and sat up, and knew him, and smiling on","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2204",3055,"it was in a steady voice that she said: ""King's Son, thou hast threatened","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2207",3055,"need; for my Mistress, of whom thou wert weary, is now grown weary of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2208",3055,"thee, and belike will not now reward me for drawing thy love to me, as","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2214",3055,"anguish of fear.  Walter, amidst of his wrath and grief, had wellnigh","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2215",3055,"drawn his sword and rushed out of his lair upon the King's Son.  But he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2216",3055,"deemed it sure that, so doing, he should undo the Maid altogether, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2221",3055,"she stood.  As to the King's Son, he was so intent upon the Maid, and so","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2222",3055,"greedy of her beauty, that it was not like that he saw anything.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2336",3055,"On the morrow morning Walter loitered a while about the house till the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2337",3055,"morn was grown old, and then about noon he took his bow and arrows and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2338",3055,"went into the woods to the northward, to get him some venison.  He went","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2339",3055,"somewhat far ere he shot him a fawn, and then he sat him down to rest","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2340",3055,"under the shade of a great chestnut-tree, for it was not far past the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2341",3055,"hottest of the day.  He looked around thence and saw below him a little","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2342",3055,"dale with a pleasant stream running through it, and he bethought him of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2343",3055,"bathing therein, so he went down and had his pleasure of the water and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2344",3055,"the willowy banks; for he lay naked a while on the grass by the lip of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2345",3055,"the water, for joy of the flickering shade, and the little breeze that","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2346",3055,"ran over the down-long ripples of the stream.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2347",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2348",3055,"Then he did on his raiment, and began to come his ways up the bent, but","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2349",3055,"had scarce gone three steps ere he saw a woman coming towards him from","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2350",3055,"downstream.  His heart came into his mouth when he saw her, for she","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2351",3055,"stooped and reached down her arm, as if she would lay her hand on her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2352",3055,"ankle, so that at first he deemed it had been the Maid, but at the second","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2353",3055,"eye-shot he saw that it was the Mistress.  She stood still and looked on","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2354",3055,"him, so that he deemed she would have him come to her.  So he went to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2355",3055,"meet her, and grew somewhat shamefaced as he drew nigher, and wondered at","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2356",3055,"her, for now was she clad but in one garment of some dark grey silky","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2357",3055,"stuff, embroidered with, as it were, a garland of flowers about the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2358",3055,"middle, but which was so thin that, as the wind drifted it from side and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2359",3055,"limb, it hid her no more, but for the said garland, than if water were","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2360",3055,"running over her: her face was full of smiling joy and content as she","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2361",3055,"spake to him in a kind, caressing voice, and said: ""I give thee good day,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2400",3055,"if praying off her anger, and pondered what answer he should make; for","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2401",3055,"now he feared for himself and the Maid; so at last he looked up to her,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2402",3055,"and said boldly: ""Nay, Lady, I know what thy words mean, whereas I","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2404",3055,"call me base-born, and of no account, and unworthy to touch the hem of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2405",3055,"thy raiment; and that I have been over-bold, and guilty towards thee; and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2406",3055,"doubtless this is sooth, and I have deserved thine anger: but I will not","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2408",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2409",3055,"She looked on him calmly now, and without any wrath, but rather as if she","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2410",3055,"would read what was written in his inmost heart.  Then her face changed","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2411",3055,"into joyousness again, and she smote her palms together, and cried out:","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2412",3055,"""This is but foolish talk; for yesterday did I see thy valiancy, and to-","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2414",3055,"be good enough for a fool woman of the earthly baronage, yet art thou","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2415",3055,"good enough for me, the wise and the mighty, and the lovely.  And whereas","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2416",3055,"thou sayest that I gave thee but disdain when first thou camest to us,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2426",3055,"Therewith her smiling face grew grave, and she stood before him looking","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2427",3055,"stately and gracious and kind at once, and she took his hand and said:","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2428",3055,"""Thou mightest deem my chamber in the Golden House of the Wood","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2434",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2435",3055,"She sidled up to him as she spoke, and would he, would he not, her sweet","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2436",3055,"voice tickled his very soul with pleasure, and she looked aside on him","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2437",3055,"happy and well-content.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2438",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2439",3055,"So they crossed the stream by the shallow below the pool wherein Walter","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2440",3055,"had bathed, and within a little they came upon a tall fence of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2441",3055,"flake-hurdles, and a simple gate therein.  The Lady opened the same, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2442",3055,"they entered thereby into a close all planted as a most fair garden, with","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2443",3055,"hedges of rose and woodbine, and with linden-trees a-blossom, and long","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2444",3055,"ways of green grass betwixt borders of lilies and clove-gilliflowers, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2446",3055,"crossed erewhile wandered through that garden; and in the midst was a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2447",3055,"little house built of post and pan, and thatched with yellow straw, as if","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2449",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2450",3055,"Then Walter looked this way and that, and wondered at first, and tried to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2452",3055,"him; but his thought would not dwell steady on any other matter than the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2453",3055,"beauty of the Lady amidst the beauty of the garden; and withal she was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2454",3055,"now grown so sweet and kind, and even somewhat timid and shy with him,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2455",3055,"that scarce did he know whose hand he held, or whose fragrant bosom and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2470",3055,"lying beside him, and the day was no longer very young; so he arose, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2471",3055,"went through the garden from end to end, and all about, and there was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2472",3055,"none there; and albeit that he dreaded to meet the Lady there, yet was he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2473",3055,"sad at heart and fearful of what might betide.  Howsoever, he found the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2474",3055,"gate whereby they had entered yesterday, and he went out into the little","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2475",3055,"dale; but when he had gone a step or two he turned about, and could see","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2476",3055,"neither garden nor fence, nor any sign of what he had seen thereof but","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2477",3055,"lately.  He knit his brow and stood still to think of it, and his heart","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2478",3055,"grew the heavier thereby; but presently he went his ways and crossed the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2479",3055,"stream, but had scarce come up on to the grass on the further side, ere","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2480",3055,"he saw a woman coming to meet him, and at first, full as he was of the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2481",3055,"tide of yesterday and the wondrous garden, deemed that it would be the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2482",3055,"Lady; but the woman stayed her feet, and, stooping, laid a hand on her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2483",3055,"right ankle, and he saw that it was the Maid.  He drew anigh to her, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2484",3055,"saw that she was nought so sad of countenance as the last time she had","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2485",3055,"met him, but flushed of cheek and bright-eyed.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2486",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2487",3055,"As he came up to her she made a step or two to meet him, holding out her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2488",3055,"two hands, and then refrained her, and said smiling: ""Ah, friend, belike","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2489",3055,"this shall be the last time that I shall say to thee, touch me not, nay,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2491",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2492",3055,"The joy grew up in his heart, and he gazed on her fondly, and said: ""Why,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2494",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2496",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2497",3055,"But as he looked on her, the smile died from her face, and she became","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2498",3055,"deadly pale to the very lips; she looked askance to her left side,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2501",3055,"round from a grey rock, but the next there was nothing.  Then the Maid,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2502",3055,"though she were as pale as death, went on in a clear, steady, hard voice,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2503",3055,"wherein was no joy or kindness, keeping her face to Walter and her back","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2504",3055,"to the stream: ""This hath befallen, friend, that there is no longer any","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2505",3055,"need to refrain thy love nor mine; therefore I say to thee, come to my","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2507",3055,"knewest it not) an hour before this next midnight, and then thy sorrow","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2508",3055,"and mine shall be at an end: and now I must needs depart.  Follow me not,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2512",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2513",3055,"But Walter stood wondering, and knew not what to make of it, whether it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2514",3055,"were for good or ill: for he knew now that she had paled and been seized","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2515",3055,"with terror because of the upheaving of the ugly head; and yet she had","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2516",3055,"seemed to speak out the very thing she had to say.  Howsoever it were, he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2517",3055,"spake aloud to himself: Whatever comes, I will keep tryst with her.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2518",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2519",3055,"Then he drew his sword, and turned this way and that, looking all about","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2520",3055,"if he might see any sign of the Evil Thing; but nought might his eyes","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2521",3055,"behold, save the grass, and the stream, and the bushes of the dale.  So","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2522",3055,"then, still holding his naked sword in his hand, he clomb the bent out of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2523",3055,"the dale; for that was the only way he knew to the Golden House; and when","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2524",3055,"he came to the top, and the summer breeze blew in his face, and he looked","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2525",3055,"down a fair green slope beset with goodly oaks and chestnuts, he was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2526",3055,"refreshed with the life of the earth, and he felt the good sword in his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2527",3055,"fist, and knew that there was might and longing in him, and the world","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2529",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2530",3055,"So he smiled, if it were somewhat grimly, and sheathed his sword and went","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2543",3055,"came; and she hailed him, and spake graciously and calmly, yet as if she","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2554",3055,"Wherefore, in spite of himself, and though he knew somewhat of her guile,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2557",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2558",3055,"Howso that might be, he took his way toward the thicket where he had","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2559",3055,"slain the lion, and came thither by then it was afternoon, at the hottest","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2560",3055,"of the day.  So he entered therein, and came to the very place whereas","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2561",3055,"the Lady had lain, when she fell down before the terror of the lion; and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2566",3055,"which he had shot, one feathered red, and one blue.  He said at first:","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2568",3055,"laughed in very despite, and said: How may that be, since there are no","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2576",3055,"me.  Yea, belike even these trees and the green grass will presently","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3717",3055,"wit that they should rest there that night, and bade them sleep in peace","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3959",3055,"what she would have done; while the others drew about in knots, but durst","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3960",3055,"not come very nigh to her.  She answered the ancient chief, and said,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3961",3055,"that she would depart presently toward the mountains, whereby she might","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3962",3055,"send them the rain which they lacked, and that thence she would away to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3963",3055,"the southward for a while; but that they should hear of her, or, it might","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3964",3055,"be, see her, before they who were now of middle age should be gone to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3965",3055,"their fathers.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3966",3055,"","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3967",3055,"Then the old man besought her that they might make her a litter of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3968",3055,"fragrant green boughs, and so bear her away toward the mountain pass","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3969",3055,"amidst a triumph of the whole folk.  But she leapt lightly down from the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3970",3055,"stone, and walked to and fro on the greensward, while it seemed of her","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3971",3055,"that her feet scarce touched the grass; and she spake to the ancient","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3972",3055,"chief where he still kneeled in worship of her, and said ""Nay; deemest","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3980",3055,"they brought meat, the daintiest they might, both for her and for Walter.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3981",3055,"But they would not look on the Maid whiles she ate, or suffer Walter to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3982",3055,"behold her the while.  Afterwards, when they had eaten, some twenty men,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3983",3055,"weaponed after their fashion, made them ready to wend with the Maiden up","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3984",3055,"into the mountains, and anon they set out thitherward all together.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3985",3055,"Howbeit, the huge men held them ever somewhat aloof from the Maid; and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3989",3055,"tilted it over with their skin-cloaks, and how they watched nightlong","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3990",3055,"about her.  But Walter they let sleep peacefully on the grass, a little","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4035",3055,"with thunder and lightning, monstrous and terrible, and all the huge","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4036",3055,"array of a summer storm.  So he was driven at last to crouch under a big","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4047",3055,"half fear and whole desire, but with a bitter oppression of dread, of","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4048",3055,"loss and misery; so that he began to fear that she had but won his love","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4054",3055,"storm abated, though the rain yet fell heavily, and he could see his way","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4055",3055,"somewhat as well as feel it: withal he found that now his path was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4056",3055,"leading him downwards.  As it grew dusk, he came down into a grassy","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4060",3055,"to himself, that on the morrow he would get him victual, so that he might","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4061",3055,"live to seek his Maiden through the wide world.  He was of somewhat","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4063",3055,"present to trouble him about the way, the anguish of his loss fell upon","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4067",3055,"voice and her speech, and her mirth.  Then he fell to crying out","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4087",3055,"He arose and looked about him, and saw where, a hundred yards aloof, was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4088",3055,"a thicket of small wood, as thorn and elder and whitebeam, all wreathed","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4089",3055,"about with the bines of wayfaring tree; it hid a bight of the stream,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4090",3055,"which turned round about it, and betwixt it and Walter was the grass","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4091",3055,"short and thick, and sweet, and all beset with flowers; and he said to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4248",3055,"they had left, but not so fair, though it was grassy and well watered,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4250",3055,"tents and pavilions pitched in the said valley, and amidst of it a throng","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4251",3055,"of men, mostly weaponed, and with horses ready saddled at hand.  So they","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4252",3055,"stayed their feet, and Walter's heart failed him, for he said to himself:","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4274",3055,"and he also bowed before Walter, but spake no word.  Then they took them","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4275",3055,"to the master pavilion, and made signs to them to sit, and they brought","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4278",3055,"knight came to them, still bowing in courteous wise, and did them to wit","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4279",3055,"by signs that they should depart: and when they were without, they saw","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4281",3055,"the pavilion, and the others mounted and ranked in good order for the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4282",3055,"road; and there were two horse-litters before them, wherein they were","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4283",3055,"bidden to mount, Walter in one, and the Maid in the other, and no","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4284",3055,"otherwise might they do.  Then presently was a horn blown, and all took","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4285",3055,"to the road together; and Walter saw betwixt the curtains of the litter","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4286",3055,"that men-at-arms rode on either side of him, albeit they had left him his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4291",3055,"drink a draught, going through the night as men who knew their way well.","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4292",3055,"As they went, Walter wondered what would betide, and if peradventure they","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4293",3055,"also would be for offering them up to their Gods; whereas they were","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4294",3055,"aliens for certain, and belike also Saracens.  Moreover there was a cold","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4295",3055,"fear at his heart that he should be sundered from the Maid, whereas their","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4296",3055,"masters now were mighty men of war, holding in their hands that which all","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4297",3055,"men desire, to wit, the manifest beauty of a woman.  Yet he strove to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4298",3055,"think the best of it that he might.  And so at last, when the night was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4299",3055,"far spent, and dawn was at hand, they stayed at a great and mighty gate","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4300",3055,"in a huge wall.  There they blew loudly on the horn thrice, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4301",3055,"thereafter the gates were opened, and they all passed through into a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4302",3055,"street, which seemed to Walter in the glimmer to be both great and goodly","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4303",3055,"amongst the abodes of men.  Then it was but a little ere they came into a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4304",3055,"square, wide-spreading, one side whereof Walter took to be the front of a","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4305",3055,"most goodly house.  There the doors of the court opened to them or ever","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4306",3055,"the horn might blow, though, forsooth, blow it did loudly three times;","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4307",3055,"all they entered therein, and men came to Walter and signed to him to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4309",3055,"but they suffered it not, but led him up a huge stair into a chamber,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4310",3055,"very great, and but dimly lighted because of its greatness.  Then they","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4311",3055,"brought him to a bed dight as fair as might be, and made signs to him to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4312",3055,"strip and lie therein.  Perforce he did so, and then they bore away his","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4313",3055,"raiment, and left him lying there.  So he lay there quietly, deeming it","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4314",3055,"no avail for him, a mother-naked man, to seek escape thence; but it was","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4315",3055,"long ere he might sleep, because of his trouble of mind.  At last, pure","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4316",3055,"weariness got the better of his hopes and fears, and he fell into slumber","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4360",3055,"great king; while the other was war-weed, seemly, well-fashioned, but","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4367",3055,"the array of the Goldings in the forefront of battle, and he made one","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4368",3055,"step toward the weapons, and laid his hand thereon.  Then ran a glad","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4369",3055,"murmur through that concourse, and the old men drew up to him smiling and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4370",3055,"joyous, and helped him to do them on; and as he took up the helm, he","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4375",3055,"on the arm of the chair, and drew forth the sword from the scabbard, and","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4376",3055,"sat him down, and laid the ancient blade across his knees; then he looked","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4377",3055,"about on those great men, and spake: ""How long shall we speak no word to","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4434",3055,"leave no heir, then send we out a great lord, with knights and sergeants,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4438",3055,"came down from the mountains by that same pass, poor and rude, but full","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4439",3055,"of valiancy, before they conquered these lands, and builded the Stark-","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4589",3055,"many folk singing; and then were the great doors thrown open, and the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4590",3055,"bishop and his priests came into the church with singing and minstrelsy,","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4594",3055,"into the choir, and came up to the King, and gave him and the Queen the","The Wood Beyond the World","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
