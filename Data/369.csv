"4488",369,"When Norman of Torn regained his senses, he found himself in a small","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4489",369,"tower room in a strange castle. His head ached horribly, and he felt","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4490",369,"sick and sore; but he managed to crawl from the cot on which he lay, and","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4491",369,"by steadying his swaying body with hands pressed against the wall, he","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4492",369,"was able to reach the door. To his disappointment, he found this locked","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4493",369,"from without and, in his weakened condition, he made no attempt to force","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4494",369,"it.","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4495",369,"","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4496",369,"He was fully dressed and in armor, as he had been when struck down, but","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4497",369,"his helmet was gone, as were also his sword and dagger.","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4498",369,"","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4499",369,"The day was drawing to a close and, as dusk fell and the room darkened,","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4500",369,"he became more and more impatient. Repeated pounding upon the door","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4501",369,"brought no response and finally he gave up in despair. Going to","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4502",369,"the window, he saw that his room was some thirty feet above the","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4503",369,"stone-flagged courtyard, and also that it looked at an angle upon other","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4504",369,"windows in the old castle where lights were beginning to show. He saw","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4505",369,"men-at-arms moving about, and once he thought he caught a glimpse of a","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4506",369,"woman's figure, but he was not sure.","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4507",369,"","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"4509",369,"hoped that they had escaped, and yet--no, Joan certainly had not, for","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4510",369,"now he distinctly remembered that his eyes had met hers for an instant","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4511",369,"just before the blow fell upon him, and he thought of the faith and","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4512",369,"confidence that he had read in that quick glance. Such a look would","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4513",369,"nerve a jackal to attack a drove of lions, thought the outlaw. What a","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4514",369,"beautiful creature she was; and she had stayed there with him during the","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4515",369,"fight. He remembered now. Mary de Stutevill had not been with her as he","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4516",369,"had caught that glimpse of her, no, she had been all alone. Ah! That was","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"4524",369,"a metal bauble linked to a mesh of his steel armor by a strand of silken","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"4526",369,"made it out to be a golden hair ornament set with precious stones, but","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4527",369,"he could not tell if the little strand of silken hair were black or","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4528",369,"brown. Carefully he detached the little thing, and, winding the filmy","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4529",369,"tress about it, placed it within the breast of his tunic. He was vaguely","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"4538",369,"man, a great, tall black-haired and mustached nobleman, was pounding","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4539",369,"upon a table to emphasize his words, and presently he sprang up","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"4540",369,"as though rushing toward the one to whom he had been speaking. He","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"4560",369,"could assure his slow wits that the cot was empty, steel fingers closed","The Outlaw of Torn","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
