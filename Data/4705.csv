"421",4705,"are qualities all united together in this apple, it is easy to perceive","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"424",4705,"Having by these divisions given an order and arrangement to our objects,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"425",4705,"we may now apply ourselves to consider with the more accuracy their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"426",4705,"qualities and relations. The first circumstance, that strikes my eye, is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"427",4705,"the great resemblance betwixt our impressions and ideas in every other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"428",4705,"particular, except their degree of force and vivacity. The one seem to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"429",4705,"be in a manner the reflexion of the other; so that all the perceptions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"430",4705,"of the mind are double, and appear both as impressions and ideas. When","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"431",4705,"I shut my eyes and think of my chamber, the ideas I form are exact","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"432",4705,"representations of the impressions I felt; nor is there any circumstance","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"433",4705,"of the one, which is not to be found in the other. In running over my","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"434",4705,"other perceptions, I find still the same resemblance and representation.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"435",4705,"Ideas and impressions appear always to correspond to each other. This","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"436",4705,"circumstance seems to me remarkable, and engages my attention for a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"437",4705,"moment.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"438",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"439",4705,"Upon a more accurate survey I find I have been carried away too far by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"440",4705,"the first appearance, and that I must make use of the distinction of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"441",4705,"perceptions into simple and complex, to limit this general decision,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"442",4705,"that all our ideas and impressions are resembling. I observe, that many","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"443",4705,"of our complex ideas never had impressions, that corresponded to them,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"444",4705,"and that many of our complex impressions never are exactly copied in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"445",4705,"ideas. I can imagine to myself such a city as the New Jerusalem, whose","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"446",4705,"pavement is gold and walls are rubies, though I never saw any such.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"447",4705,"I have seen Paris; but shall I affirm I can form such an idea of that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"448",4705,"city, as will perfectly represent all its streets and houses in their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"449",4705,"real and just proportions?","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"450",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"451",4705,"I perceive, therefore, that though there is in general a great,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"452",4705,"resemblance betwixt our complex impressions and ideas, yet the rule is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"453",4705,"not universally true, that they are exact copies of each other. We may","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"454",4705,"next consider how the case stands with our simple, perceptions. After","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"455",4705,"the most accurate examination, of which I am capable, I venture to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"456",4705,"affirm, that the rule here holds without any exception, and that every","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"457",4705,"simple idea has a simple impression, which resembles it, and every","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"458",4705,"simple impression a correspondent idea. That idea of red, which we form","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"459",4705,"in the dark, and that impression which strikes our eyes in sun-shine,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"460",4705,"differ only in degree, not in nature. That the case is the same with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"461",4705,"all our simple impressions and ideas, it is impossible to prove by a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"462",4705,"particular enumeration of them. Every one may satisfy himself in this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"463",4705,"point by running over as many as he pleases. But if any one should deny","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"464",4705,"this universal resemblance, I know no way of convincing him, but by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"465",4705,"desiring him to shew a simple impression, that has not a correspondent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"466",4705,"idea, or a simple idea, that has not a correspondent impression. If he","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"467",4705,"does not answer this challenge, as it is certain he cannot, we may from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"468",4705,"his silence and our own observation establish our conclusion.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"469",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"470",4705,"Thus we find, that all simple ideas and impressions resemble each other;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"471",4705,"and as the complex are formed from them, we may affirm in general,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"472",4705,"that these two species of perception are exactly correspondent. Having","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"473",4705,"discovered this relation, which requires no farther examination, I am","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"474",4705,"curious to find some other of their qualities. Let us consider how they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"475",4705,"stand with regard to their existence, and which of the impressions and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"476",4705,"ideas are causes, and which effects.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"477",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"478",4705,"The full examination of this question is the subject of the present","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"479",4705,"treatise; and therefore we shall here content ourselves with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"480",4705,"establishing one general proposition, THAT ALL OUR SIMPLE IDEAS IN","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"481",4705,"THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE ARE DERIVED FROM SIMPLE IMPRESSIONS, WHICH ARE","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"482",4705,"CORRESPONDENT TO THEM, AND WHICH THEY EXACTLY REPRESENT.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"483",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"484",4705,"In seeking for phenomena to prove this proposition, I find only those","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"485",4705,"of two kinds; but in each kind the phenomena are obvious, numerous, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"486",4705,"conclusive. I first make myself certain, by a new, review, of what I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"487",4705,"have already asserted, that every simple impression is attended with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"488",4705,"a correspondent idea, and every simple idea with a correspondent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"489",4705,"impression. From this constant conjunction of resembling perceptions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"490",4705,"I immediately conclude, that there is a great connexion betwixt our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"491",4705,"correspondent impressions and ideas, and that the existence of the one","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"492",4705,"has a considerable influence upon that of the other. Such a constant","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"493",4705,"conjunction, in such an infinite number of instances, can never arise","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"494",4705,"from chance; but clearly proves a dependence of the impressions on the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"495",4705,"ideas, or of the ideas on the impressions. That I may know on which side","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"496",4705,"this dependence lies, I consider the order of their first appearance;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"497",4705,"and find by constant experience, that the simple impressions always take","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"498",4705,"the precedence of their correspondent ideas, but never appear in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"499",4705,"contrary order. To give a child an idea of scarlet or orange, of sweet","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"500",4705,"or bitter, I present the objects, or in other words, convey to him these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"501",4705,"impressions; but proceed not so absurdly, as to endeavour to produce","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"502",4705,"the impressions by exciting the ideas. Our ideas upon their appearance","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"503",4705,"produce not their correspondent impressions, nor do we perceive any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"504",4705,"colour, or feel any sensation merely upon thinking of them. On the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"505",4705,"other hand we find, that any impression either of the mind or body","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"506",4705,"is constantly followed by an idea, which resembles it, and is only","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"507",4705,"different in the degrees of force and liveliness, The constant","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"508",4705,"conjunction of our resembling perceptions, is a convincing proof,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"509",4705,"that the one are the causes of the other; and this priority of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"510",4705,"impressions is an equal proof, that our impressions are the causes of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"511",4705,"our ideas, not our ideas of our impressions.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"512",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"513",4705,"To confirm this I consider Another plain and convincing phaenomenon;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"514",4705,"which is, that, where-ever by any accident the faculties, which give","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"515",4705,"rise to any impressions, are obstructed in their operations, as when one","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"516",4705,"is born blind or deaf; not only the impressions are lost, but also their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"517",4705,"correspondent ideas; so that there never appear in the mind the least","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"518",4705,"traces of either of them. Nor is this only true, where the organs of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"519",4705,"sensation are entirely destroyed, but likewise where they have never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"520",4705,"been put in action to produce a particular impression. We cannot form","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"521",4705,"to ourselves a just idea of the taste of a pine apple, without having","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"522",4705,"actually tasted it.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"523",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"524",4705,"There is however one contradictory phaenomenon, which may prove, that it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"525",4705,"is not absolutely impossible for ideas to go before their correspondent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"526",4705,"impressions. I believe it will readily be allowed that the several","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"527",4705,"distinct ideas of colours, which enter by the eyes, or those of sounds,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"528",4705,"which are conveyed by the hearing, are really different from each other,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"529",4705,"though at the same time resembling. Now if this be true of different","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"530",4705,"colours, it must be no less so of the different shades of the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"531",4705,"colour, that each of them produces a distinct idea, independent of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"532",4705,"rest. For if this should be denied, it is possible, by the continual","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"533",4705,"gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"534",4705,"from it; and if you will not allow any of the means to be different,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"535",4705,"you cannot without absurdity deny the extremes to be the same. Suppose","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"536",4705,"therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"537",4705,"to have become perfectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"538",4705,"excepting one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"539",4705,"has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"540",4705,"that colour, except that single one, be placed before him, descending","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"541",4705,"gradually from the deepest to the lightest; it is plain, that he will","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"542",4705,"perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, said will be sensible,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"543",4705,"that there is a greater distance in that place betwixt the contiguous","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"544",4705,"colours, than in any other. Now I ask, whether it is possible for him,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"545",4705,"from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"546",4705,"himself the idea of that particular shade, though it had never been","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"547",4705,"conveyed to him by his senses? I believe there are few but will be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"548",4705,"of opinion that he can; and this may serve as a proof, that the simple","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"549",4705,"ideas are not always derived from the correspondent impressions; though","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"550",4705,"the instance is so particular and singular, that it is scarce worth","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"551",4705,"our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"552",4705,"general maxim.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"553",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"554",4705,"But besides this exception, it may not be amiss to remark on this head,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"555",4705,"that the principle of the priority of impressions to ideas must be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"556",4705,"understood with another limitation, viz., that as our ideas are images","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"557",4705,"of our impressions, so we can form secondary ideas, which are images of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"558",4705,"the primary; as appears from this very reasoning concerning them.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"559",4705,"This is not, properly speaking, an exception to the rule so much as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"560",4705,"an explanation of it. Ideas produce the images of themselves in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"561",4705,"new ideas; but as the first ideas are supposed to be derived from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"562",4705,"impressions, it still remains true, that all our simple ideas proceed","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"563",4705,"either mediately or immediately, from their correspondent impressions.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"564",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"565",4705,"This then is the first principle I establish in the science of human","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"566",4705,"nature; nor ought we to despise it because of the simplicity of its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"567",4705,"appearance. For it is remarkable, that the present question concerning","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"568",4705,"the precedency of our impressions or ideas, is the same with what has","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"569",4705,"made so much noise in other terms, when it has been disputed whether","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"570",4705,"there be any INNATE IDEAS, or whether all ideas be derived from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"571",4705,"sensation and reflexion. We may observe, that in order to prove the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"572",4705,"ideas of extension and colour not to be innate, philosophers do nothing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"573",4705,"but shew that they are conveyed by our senses. To prove the ideas","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"574",4705,"of passion and desire not to be innate, they observe that we have a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"575",4705,"preceding experience of these emotions in ourselves. Now if we carefully","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"576",4705,"examine these arguments, we shall find that they prove nothing but that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"577",4705,"ideas are preceded by other more lively perceptions, from which the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"578",4705,"are derived, and which they represent. I hope this clear stating of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"579",4705,"question will remove all disputes concerning it, and win render this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"591",4705,"to require we should examine our impressions, before we consider our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"592",4705,"ideas. Impressions way be divided into two kinds, those Of SENSATION and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"593",4705,"those of REFLEXION. The first kind arises in the soul originally, from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"594",4705,"unknown causes. The second is derived in a great measure from our ideas,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"595",4705,"and that in the following order. An impression first strikes upon the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"596",4705,"senses, and makes us perceive heat or cold, thirst or hunger, pleasure","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"597",4705,"or pain of some kind or other. Of this impression there is a copy taken","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"598",4705,"by the mind, which remains after the impression ceases; and this we call","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"599",4705,"an idea. This idea of pleasure or pain, when it returns upon the soul,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"600",4705,"produces the new impressions of desire and aversion, hope and fear,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"601",4705,"which may properly be called impressions of reflexion, because derived","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"602",4705,"from it. These again are copied by the memory and imagination, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"603",4705,"become ideas; which perhaps in their turn give rise to other impressions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"604",4705,"and ideas. So that the impressions of reflexion are only antecedent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"605",4705,"to their correspondent ideas; but posterior to those of sensation, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"606",4705,"derived from them. The examination of our sensations belongs more to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"607",4705,"anatomists and natural philosophers than to moral; and therefore shall","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"944",4705,"it having been esteemed absurd to defend the former proposition, as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"949",4705,"by proving, that it is utterly impossible to conceive any quantity or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"950",4705,"quality, without forming a precise notion of its degrees: And secondly","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"951",4705,"by showing, that though the capacity of the mind be not infinite, yet","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"957",4705,"NOTION OF QUANTITY OR QUALITY WITHOUT FORMING A PRECISE NOTION OF","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"958",4705,"DEGREES OF EACH; we may prove this by the three following arguments.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"959",4705,"First, We have observed, that whatever objects are different are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"960",4705,"distinguishable, and that whatever objects are distinguishable are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"961",4705,"separable by the thought and imagination. And we may here add, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"962",4705,"these propositions are equally true in the inverse, and that whatever","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"963",4705,"objects are separable are also distinguishable, and that whatever","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"964",4705,"objects are distinguishable, are also different. For how is it possible","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"965",4705,"we can separate what is not distinguishable, or distinguish what is not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"966",4705,"different? In order therefore to know, whether abstraction implies a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"967",4705,"separation, we need only consider it in this view, and examine, whether","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"968",4705,"all the circumstances, which we abstract from in our general ideas, be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"969",4705,"such as are distinguishable and different from those, which we retain","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"970",4705,"as essential parts of them. But it is evident at first sight, that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"971",4705,"precise length of a line is not different nor distinguishable from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"972",4705,"line itself nor the precise degree of any quality from the quality.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"973",4705,"These ideas, therefore, admit no more of separation than they do of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"974",4705,"distinction and difference. They are consequently conjoined with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"975",4705,"each other in the conception; and the general idea of a line,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"976",4705,"notwithstanding all our abstractions and refinements, has in its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"977",4705,"appearance in the mind a precise degree of quantity and quality; however","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"978",4705,"it may be made to represent others, which have different degrees of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"979",4705,"both.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"980",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"981",4705,"Secondly, it is contest, that no object can appear to the senses; or in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"982",4705,"other words, that no impression can become present to the mind, without","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"987",4705,"degree nor proportion. That is a contradiction in terms; and even","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"988",4705,"implies the flattest of all contradictions, viz. that it is possible for","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"989",4705,"the same thing both to be and not to be.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"990",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"991",4705,"Now since all ideas are derived from impressions, and are nothing but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"992",4705,"copies and representations of them, whatever is true of the one must be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"993",4705,"acknowledged concerning the other. Impressions and ideas differ only in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"994",4705,"their strength and vivacity. The foregoing conclusion is not founded on","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"995",4705,"any particular degree of vivacity. It cannot therefore be affected by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"997",4705,"as a strong impression must necessarily have a determinate quantity and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"998",4705,"quality, the case must be the same with its copy or representative.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"999",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1000",4705,"Thirdly, it is a principle generally received in philosophy that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1002",4705,"suppose a triangle really existent, which has no precise proportion of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1003",4705,"sides and angles. If this therefore be absurd in fact and reality, it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1004",4705,"must also be absurd in idea; since nothing of which we can form a clear","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1005",4705,"and distinct idea is absurd and impossible. But to form the idea of an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1006",4705,"object, and to form an idea simply, is the same thing; the reference","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1007",4705,"of the idea to an object being an extraneous denomination, of which in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1008",4705,"itself it bears no mark or character. Now as it is impossible to form an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1009",4705,"idea of an object, that is possest of quantity and quality, and yet","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1010",4705,"is possest of no precise degree of either; it follows that there is an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1011",4705,"equal impossibility of forming an idea, that is not limited and confined","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1012",4705,"in both these particulars. Abstract ideas are therefore in themselves","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1109",4705,"term, which from a customary conjunction has a relation to many other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1113",4705,"regard to that custom, which so readily recalls every particular idea,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1114",4705,"for which we may have occasion, and is excited by any word or sound, to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1115",4705,"which we commonly annex it. The most proper method, in my opinion,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1116",4705,"of giving a satisfactory explication of this act of the mind, is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1117",4705,"by producing other instances, which are analogous to it, and other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1121",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1122",4705,"First then I observe, that when we mention any great number, such as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1124",4705,"power of producing such an idea, by its adequate idea of the decimals,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1172",4705,"that, which has hitherto prevailed in philosophy, But, to tell the truth","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1175",4705,"explaining them. We must certainly seek some new system on this head,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1176",4705,"and there plainly is none beside what I have proposed. If ideas be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1178",4705,"it is only by custom they can become general in their representation,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1180",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1181",4705,"Before I leave this subject I shall employ the same principles to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1182",4705,"explain that distinction of reason, which is so much talked of, and is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1183",4705,"so little understood, in the schools. Of this kind is the distinction","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1184",4705,"betwixt figure and the body figured; motion and the body moved. The","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1185",4705,"difficulty of explaining this distinction arises from the principle","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1186",4705,"above explained, that all ideas, which are different, are separable. For","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1187",4705,"it follows from thence, that if the figure be different from the body,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1193",4705,"To remove this difficulty we must have recourse to the foregoing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"1195",4705,"have dreamed of distinguishing a figure from the body figured, as being","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1196",4705,"in reality neither distinguishable, nor different, nor separable; did it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1197",4705,"not observe, that even in this simplicity there might be contained many","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1198",4705,"different resemblances and relations. Thus when a globe of white marble","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1199",4705,"is presented, we receive only the impression of a white colour disposed","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1200",4705,"in a certain form, nor are we able to separate and distinguish the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1201",4705,"colour from the form. But observing afterwards a globe of black marble","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1202",4705,"and a cube of white, and comparing them with our former object, we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1203",4705,"find two separate resemblances, in what formerly seemed, and really is,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1204",4705,"perfectly inseparable. After a little more practice of this kind, we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1205",4705,"begin to distinguish the figure from the colour by a distinction of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1206",4705,"reason; that is, we consider the figure and colour together, since they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1207",4705,"are in effect the same and undistinguishable; but still view them in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1208",4705,"different aspects, according to the resemblances, of which they are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1209",4705,"susceptible. When we would consider only the figure of the globe of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1210",4705,"white marble, we form in reality an idea both of the figure and colour,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1211",4705,"but tacitly carry our eye to its resemblance with the globe of black","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"1212",4705,"marble: And in the same manner, when we would consider its colour only,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2401",4705,"shewn, why upon our conception of any idea, the animal spirits run","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2402",4705,"into all the contiguous traces, and rouze up the other ideas, that are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2403",4705,"related to it. But though I have neglected any advantage, which I might","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2404",4705,"have drawn from this topic in explaining the relations of ideas, I am","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2405",4705,"afraid I must here have recourse to it, in order to account for the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2406",4705,"mistakes that arise from these relations. I shall therefore observe,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2407",4705,"that as the mind is endowed with a power of exciting any idea it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2408",4705,"pleases; whenever it dispatches the spirits into that region of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2409",4705,"brain, in which the idea is placed; these spirits always excite the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2410",4705,"idea, when they run precisely into the proper traces, and rummage that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2411",4705,"cell, which belongs to the idea. But as their motion is seldom direct,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2412",4705,"and naturally turns a little to the one side or the other; for this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2413",4705,"reason the animal spirits, falling into the contiguous traces, present","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2414",4705,"other related ideas in lieu of that, which the mind desired at first to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2415",4705,"survey. This change we are not always sensible of; but continuing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2416",4705,"still the same train of thought, make use of the related idea, which is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2417",4705,"presented to us, and employ it in our reasoning, as if it were the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2418",4705,"with what we demanded. This is the cause of many mistakes and sophisms","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2419",4705,"in philosophy; as will naturally be imagined, and as it would be easy to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2421",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2422",4705,"Of the three relations above-mentioned that of resemblance is the most","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2424",4705,"which do not borrow largely from that origin. Resembling ideas are not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2425",4705,"only related together, but the actions of the mind, which we employ","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2426",4705,"in considering them, are so little different, that we are not able to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2427",4705,"distinguish them. This last circumstance is of great consequence, and we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2428",4705,"may in general observe, that wherever the actions of the mind in forming","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2429",4705,"any two ideas are the same or resembling, we are very apt to confound","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2430",4705,"these ideas, and take the one for the other. Of this we shall see many","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2431",4705,"instances in the progress of this treatise. But though resemblance be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2433",4705,"the others of causation and contiguity may also concur in the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2440",4705,"to talk instead of thinking in their reasonings. We use words for ideas,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2441",4705,"because they are commonly so closely connected that the mind easily","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2443",4705,"the idea of a distance, which is not considered either as visible or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2471",4705,"find that these are the only impressions such an object can produce","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"2472",4705,"after the supposed annihilation; and it has already been remarked, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2475",4705,"Since a body interposed betwixt two others may be supposed to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"2492",4705,"difficulties. It will probably be said, that my reasoning makes nothing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"3000",4705,"First, For what reason we pronounce it necessary, that every thing whose","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"3022",4705,"To begin with the first question concerning the necessity of a cause:","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3023",4705,"It is a general maxim in philosophy, that whatever begins to exist, must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3024",4705,"have a cause of existence. This is commonly taken for granted in all","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3025",4705,"reasonings, without any proof given or demanded. It is supposed to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3026",4705,"founded on intuition, and to be one of those maxims, which though they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3027",4705,"may be denyed with the lips, it is impossible for men in their hearts","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3028",4705,"really to doubt of. But if we examine this maxim by the idea of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3029",4705,"knowledge above-explained, we shall discover in it no mark of any such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3030",4705,"intuitive certainty; but on the contrary shall find, that it is of a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3031",4705,"nature quite foreign to that species of conviction.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3032",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"3034",4705,"discovery of such relations as are unalterable, so long as the ideas","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"3046",4705,"never demonstrate the necessity of a cause to every new existence, or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3047",4705,"new modification of existence, without shewing at the same time the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3048",4705,"impossibility there is, that any thing can ever begin to exist without","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3049",4705,"some productive principle; and where the latter proposition cannot be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3050",4705,"proved, we must despair of ever being able to prove the former. Now that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3051",4705,"the latter proposition is utterly incapable of a demonstrative proof,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3052",4705,"we may satisfy ourselves by considering that as all distinct ideas are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3053",4705,"separable from each other, and as the ideas of cause and effect are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3054",4705,"evidently distinct, it will be easy for us to conceive any object to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"3057",4705,"therefore, of the idea of a cause from that of a beginning of existence,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3058",4705,"is plainly possible for the imagination; and consequently the actual","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3059",4705,"separation of these objects is so far possible, that it implies no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3060",4705,"contradiction nor absurdity; and is therefore incapable of being refuted","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3061",4705,"by any reasoning from mere ideas; without which it is impossible to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3062",4705,"demonstrate the necessity of a cause.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3063",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3064",4705,"Accordingly we shall find upon examination, that every demonstration,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3065",4705,"which has been produced for the necessity of a cause, is fallacious and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3066",4705,"sophistical. All the points of time and place, say some philosophers","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3067",4705,"[Mr. Hobbes.], in which we can suppose any object to begin to exist, are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3068",4705,"in themselves equal; and unless there be some cause, which is peculiar","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3069",4705,"to one time and to one place, and which by that means determines and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3070",4705,"fixes the existence, it must remain in eternal suspence; and the object","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3071",4705,"can never begin to be, for want of something to fix its beginning. But I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3072",4705,"ask; Is there any more difficulty in supposing the time and place to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3073",4705,"fixed without a cause, than to suppose the existence to be determined in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3074",4705,"that manner? The first question that occurs on this subject is always,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3075",4705,"whether the object shall exist or not: The next, when and where it shall","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3076",4705,"begin to exist. If the removal of a cause be intuitively absurd in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3077",4705,"one case, it must be so in the other: And if that absurdity be not clear","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3078",4705,"without a proof in the one case, it will equally require one in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3079",4705,"other. The absurdity, then, of the one supposition can never be a proof","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3080",4705,"of that of the other; since they are both upon the same footing, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3081",4705,"must stand or fall by the same reasoning.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3082",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3083",4705,"The second argument [Dr. Clarke and others.], which I find used on this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3084",4705,"head, labours under an equal difficulty. Every thing, it is said, must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3085",4705,"have a cause; for if any thing wanted a cause, it would produce","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3086",4705,"ITSELF; that is, exist before it existed; which is impossible. But this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3087",4705,"reasoning is plainly unconclusive; because it supposes, that in our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3088",4705,"denial of a cause we still grant what we expressly deny, viz. that there","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3089",4705,"must be a cause; which therefore is taken to be the object itself; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3090",4705,"that, no doubt, is an evident contradiction. But to say that any thing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3091",4705,"is produced, or to express myself more properly, comes into existence,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3092",4705,"without a cause, is not to affirm, that it is itself its own cause; but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3093",4705,"on the contrary in excluding all external causes, excludes a fortiori","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3094",4705,"the thing itself, which is created. An object, that exists absolutely","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3095",4705,"without any cause, certainly is not its own cause; and when you assert,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3096",4705,"that the one follows from the other, you suppose the very point in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3097",4705,"questions and take it for granted, that it is utterly impossible any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3098",4705,"thing can ever begin to exist without a cause, but that, upon the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3099",4705,"exclusion of one productive principle, we must still have recourse to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3100",4705,"another.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3101",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3102",4705,"It is exactly the same case with the third argument [Mr. Locke.], which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3103",4705,"has been employed to demonstrate the necessity of a cause. Whatever is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3104",4705,"produced without any cause, is produced by nothing; or in other words,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3105",4705,"has nothing for its cause. But nothing can never be a cause, no more","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3106",4705,"than it can be something, or equal to two right angles. By the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3107",4705,"intuition, that we perceive nothing not to be equal to two right angles,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"3110",4705,"existence.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3111",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3112",4705,"I believe it will not be necessary to employ many words in shewing the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3113",4705,"weakness of this argument, after what I have said of the foregoing. They","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3114",4705,"are all of them founded on the same fallacy, and are derived from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3115",4705,"same turn of thought. It is sufficient only to observe, that when","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3116",4705,"we exclude all causes we really do exclude them, and neither suppose","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3117",4705,"nothing nor the object itself to be the causes of the existence;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3118",4705,"and consequently can draw no argument from the absurdity of these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3119",4705,"suppositions to prove the absurdity of that exclusion. If every thing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3120",4705,"must have a cause, it follows, that upon the exclusion of other causes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3121",4705,"we must accept of the object itself or of nothing as causes. But it is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3122",4705,"the very point in question, whether every thing must have a cause or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3123",4705,"not; and therefore, according to all just reasoning, it ought never to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3124",4705,"be taken for granted.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3125",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3126",4705,"They are still more frivolous, who say, that every effect must have a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3127",4705,"cause, because it is implyed in the very idea of effect. Every effect","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3128",4705,"necessarily pre-supposes a cause; effect being a relative term, of which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3129",4705,"cause is the correlative. But this does not prove, that every being must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3130",4705,"be preceded by a cause; no more than it follows, because every husband","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3131",4705,"must have a wife, that therefore every man must be marryed. The true","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3132",4705,"state of the question is, whether every object, which begins to exist,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3133",4705,"must owe its existence to a cause: and this I assert neither to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"3134",4705,"intuitively nor demonstratively certain, and hope to have proved it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4037",4705,"objection, by reason of a little ambiguity in those words strong and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4040",4705,"upon my principle, that all our ideas are derived from correspondent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4541",4705,"find less difficulty in explaining its effects on the imagination,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4542",4705,"however extraordinary they may appear. It is certain we cannot take","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4543",4705,"pleasure in any discourse, where our judgment gives no assent to those","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4544",4705,"images which are presented to our fancy. The conversation of those who","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4545",4705,"have acquired a habit of lying, though in affairs of no moment, never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4546",4705,"gives any satisfaction; and that because those ideas they present to us,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4547",4705,"not being attended with belief, make no impression upon the mind. Poets","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4548",4705,"themselves, though liars by profession, always endeavour to give an air","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4549",4705,"of truth to their fictions; and where that is totally neglected, their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4550",4705,"performances, however ingenious, will never be able to afford much","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4551",4705,"pleasure. In short, we may observe, that even when ideas have no manner","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4552",4705,"of influence on the will and passions, truth and reality are still","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4555",4705,"But if we compare together all the phenomena that occur on this head,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4556",4705,"we shall find, that truth, however necessary it may seem in all works","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4557",4705,"of genius, has no other effect than to procure an easy reception for the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4558",4705,"ideas, and to make the mind acquiesce in them with satisfaction, or at","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4559",4705,"least without reluctance. But as this is an effect, which may easily be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4560",4705,"supposed to flow from that solidity and force, which, according to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4561",4705,"my system, attend those ideas that are established by reasonings from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4562",4705,"causation; it follows, that all the influence of belief upon the fancy","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4563",4705,"may be explained from that system. Accordingly we may observe, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4564",4705,"wherever that influence arises from any other principles beside truth or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4565",4705,"reality, they supply its place, and give an equal entertainment to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4566",4705,"the imagination. Poets have formed what they call a poetical system of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4567",4705,"things, which though it be believed neither by themselves nor readers,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4568",4705,"is commonly esteemed a sufficient foundation for any fiction. We have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4569",4705,"been so much accustomed to the names of MARS, JUPITER, VENUS, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4570",4705,"in the same manner as education infixes any opinion, the constant","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4571",4705,"repetition of these ideas makes them enter into the mind with facility,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4572",4705,"and prevail upon the fancy, without influencing the judgment. In like","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4573",4705,"manner tragedians always borrow their fable, or at least the names of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4574",4705,"their principal actors, from some known passage in history; and that not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4575",4705,"in order to deceive the spectators; for they will frankly confess, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4576",4705,"truth is not in any circumstance inviolably observed: but in order","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4577",4705,"to procure a more easy reception into the imagination for those","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4578",4705,"extraordinary events, which they represent. But this is a precaution,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4579",4705,"which is not required of comic poets, whose personages and incidents,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4586",4705,"satisfyed without any absolute belief or assurance; but may in another","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4587",4705,"view be regarded as a very strong confirmation of this system. It is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4588",4705,"evident, that poets make use of this artifice of borrowing the names","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4589",4705,"of their persons, and the chief events of their poems, from history, in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4590",4705,"order to procure a more easy reception for the whole, and cause it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4591",4705,"to make a deeper impression on the fancy and affections. The several","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4592",4705,"incidents of the piece acquire a kind of relation by being united into","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4593",4705,"one poem or representation; and if any of these incidents be an object","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4594",4705,"of belief, it bestows a force and vivacity on the others, which are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4595",4705,"related to it. The vividness of the first conception diffuses itself","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4596",4705,"along the relations, and is conveyed, as by so many pipes or canals,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4597",4705,"to every idea that has any communication with the primary one. This,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4598",4705,"indeed, can never amount to a perfect assurance; and that because","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4599",4705,"the union among the ideas is, in a manner, accidental: But still it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4600",4705,"approaches so near, in its influence, as may convince us, that they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4601",4705,"are derived from the same origin. Belief must please the imagination","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4602",4705,"by means of the force and vivacity which attends it; since every idea,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4611",4705,"and the vivacity produced by the fancy is in many cases greater than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4612",4705,"that which arises from custom and experience. We are hurried away by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4613",4705,"lively imagination of our author or companion; and even he himself is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4638",4705,"feeling with that which arises in the mind, when we reason, though even","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4642",4705,"belief or persuasion. The case is the same with the idea, as with the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4643",4705,"passion it occasions. There is no passion of the human mind but what may","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4644",4705,"arise from poetry; though at the same time the feelings of the passions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4645",4705,"are very different when excited by poetical fictions, from what they are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4646",4705,"when they are from belief and reality. A passion, which is disagreeable","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4647",4705,"in real life, may afford the highest entertainment in a tragedy, or epic","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4648",4705,"poem. In the latter case, it lies not with that weight upon us: It","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4650",4705,"exciting the spirits, and rouzing the attention. The difference in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4652",4705,"which the passions are derived. Where the vivacity arises from a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4672",4705,"from poetry and eloquence, is a circumstance merely accidental, of which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4791",4705,"the same arguments we employed in examining that belief, which arises","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4792",4705,"from causes; and may prove, after the same manner, that a superior","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4814",4705,"question is, by what means a superior number of equal chances operates","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4815",4705,"upon the mind, and produces belief or assent; since it appears, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4825",4705,"of sides. He in a manner believes, that this will lie uppermost; though","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4828",4705,"and the superiority encreases on the other side, his belief acquires new","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4829",4705,"degrees of stability and assurance. This belief arises from an operation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"4835",4705,"This dye, formed as above, contains three circumstances worthy of our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4836",4705,"attention. First, Certain causes, such as gravity, solidity, a cubical","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4837",4705,"figure, &c. which determine it to fall, to preserve its form in its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4838",4705,"fall, and to turn up one of its sides. Secondly, A certain number","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4839",4705,"of sides, which are supposed indifferent. Thirdly, A certain figure","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4840",4705,"inscribed on each side. These three particulars form the whole nature of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4841",4705,"the dye, so far as relates to our present purpose; and consequently are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4842",4705,"the only circumstances regarded by the mind in its forming a judgment","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4843",4705,"concerning the result of such a throw. Let us, therefore, consider","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4844",4705,"gradually and carefully what must be the influence of these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4845",4705,"circumstances on the thought and imagination.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4846",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4847",4705,"First, We have already observed, that the mind is determined by custom","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4848",4705,"to pass from any cause to its effect, and that upon the appearance","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4849",4705,"of the one, it is almost impossible for it not to form an idea of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4850",4705,"other. Their constant conjunction in past instances has produced such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4851",4705,"a habit in the mind, that it always conjoins them in its thought, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4852",4705,"infers the existence of the one from that of its usual attendant. When","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4853",4705,"it considers the dye as no longer supported by the box, it can not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4854",4705,"without violence regard it as suspended in the air; but naturally places","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4855",4705,"it on the table, and views it as turning up one of its sides. This","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4856",4705,"is the effect of the intermingled causes, which are requisite to our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4857",4705,"forming any calculation concerning chances.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4858",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4859",4705,"Secondly, It is supposed, that though the dye be necessarily determined","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4860",4705,"to fall, and turn up one of its sides, yet there is nothing to fix the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4861",4705,"particular side, but that this is determined entirely by chance. The","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4862",4705,"very nature and essence of chance is a negation of causes, and the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4863",4705,"leaving the mind in a perfect indifference among those events, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4864",4705,"are supposed contingent. When therefore the thought is determined by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4865",4705,"causes to consider the dye as falling and turning up one of its sides,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4866",4705,"the chances present all these sides as equal, and make us consider every","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4867",4705,"one of them, one after another, as alike probable and possible. The","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4868",4705,"imagination passes from the cause, viz. the throwing of the dye, to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4869",4705,"effect, viz. the turning up one of the six sides; and feels a kind of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4870",4705,"impossibility both of stopping short in the way, and of forming any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4871",4705,"other idea. But as all these six sides are incompatible, and the dye","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4872",4705,"cannot turn up above one at once, this principle directs us not to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4873",4705,"consider all of them at once as lying uppermost; which we look upon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4874",4705,"as impossible: Neither does it direct us with its entire force to any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4875",4705,"particular side; for in that case this side would be considered as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4876",4705,"certain and inevitable; but it directs us to the whole six sides after","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4877",4705,"such a manner as to divide its force equally among them. We conclude in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4878",4705,"general, that some one of them must result from the throw: We run all","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4879",4705,"of them over in our minds: The determination of the thought is common to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4880",4705,"all; but no more of its force falls to the share of any one, than what","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4881",4705,"is suitable to its proportion with the rest. It is after this manner the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4882",4705,"original impulse, and consequently the vivacity of thought, arising from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4883",4705,"the causes, is divided and split in pieces by the intermingled chances.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4884",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4885",4705,"We have already seen the influence of the two first qualities of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4886",4705,"dye, viz. the causes, and the number and indifference of the sides, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4887",4705,"have learned how they give an impulse to the thought, and divide that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4888",4705,"impulse into as many parts as there are unites in the number of sides.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4889",4705,"We must now consider the effects of the third particular, viz. the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4890",4705,"figures inscribed on each side. It is evident that where several","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4891",4705,"sides have the same figure inscribe on them, they must concur in their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4892",4705,"influence on the mind, and must unite upon one image or idea of a figure","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4893",4705,"all those divided impulses, that were dispersed over the several sides,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4894",4705,"upon which that figure is inscribed. Were the question only what side","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4895",4705,"will be turned up, these are all perfectly equal, and no one coued ever","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4896",4705,"have any advantage above another. But as the question is concerning the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4897",4705,"figure, and as the same figure is presented by more than one side: it is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4898",4705,"evident, that the impulses belonging to all these sides must re-unite","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4899",4705,"in that one figure, and become stronger and more forcible by the union.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4900",4705,"Four sides are supposed in the present case to have the same figure","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4901",4705,"inscribed on them, and two to have another figure. The impulses of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4902",4705,"the former are, therefore, superior to those of the latter. But as the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4903",4705,"events are contrary, and it is impossible both these figures can be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4904",4705,"turned up; the impulses likewise become contrary, and the inferior","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"4905",4705,"destroys the superior, as far as its strength goes. The vivacity of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5125",4705,"conjunction sufficiently proves the one part to be the cause of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5131",4705,"Let us now join these three observations, and see what conclusion we can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5132",4705,"draw from them. To every probability there is an opposite possibility.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5133",4705,"This possibility is composed of parts, that are entirely of the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5134",4705,"nature with those of the probability; and consequently have the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5135",4705,"influence on the mind and understanding. The belief, which attends the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5136",4705,"probability, is a compounded effect, and is formed by the concurrence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5137",4705,"of the several effects, which proceed from each part of the probability.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5138",4705,"Since therefore each part of the probability contributes to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5139",4705,"production of the belief, each part of the possibility must have the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5140",4705,"same influence on the opposite side; the nature of these parts being","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5141",4705,"entirely the same. The contrary belief, attending the possibility,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5142",4705,"implies a view of a certain object, as well as the probability does","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5143",4705,"an opposite view. In this particular both these degrees of belief are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5144",4705,"alike. The only manner then, in which the superior number of similar","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5145",4705,"component parts in the one can exert its influence, and prevail above","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5146",4705,"the inferior in the other, is by producing a stronger and more lively","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5147",4705,"view of its object. Each part presents a particular view; and all these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5148",4705,"views uniting together produce one general view, which is fuller and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5149",4705,"more distinct by the greater number of causes or principles, from which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5150",4705,"it is derived.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5151",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5152",4705,"The component parts of the probability and possibility, being alike","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5153",4705,"in their nature, must produce like effects; and the likeness of their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5154",4705,"effects consists in this, that each of them presents a view of a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5155",4705,"particular object. But though these parts be alike in their nature, they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5156",4705,"are very different in their quantity and number; and this difference","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5164",4705,"Here is almost the same argument in a different light. All our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5165",4705,"reasonings concerning the probability of causes are founded on the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5166",4705,"transferring of past to future. The transferring of any past experiment","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5169",4705,"whether it be entire, or opposed by others of a contrary kind. Suppose,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5170",4705,"then, it acquires both these qualities of combination and opposition, it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5171",4705,"loses not upon that account its former power of presenting a view of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5172",4705,"object, but only concurs with and opposes other experiments, that have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5173",4705,"a like influence. A question, therefore, may arise concerning the manner","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5174",4705,"both of the concurrence and opposition. As to the concurrence, there is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5175",4705,"only the choice left betwixt these two hypotheses. First, That the view","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5176",4705,"of the object, occasioned by the transference of each past experiment,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5177",4705,"preserves itself entire, and only multiplies the number of views. Or,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5178",4705,"SECONDLY, That it runs into the other similar and correspondent views,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5179",4705,"and gives them a superior degree of force and vivacity. But that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5180",4705,"first hypothesis is erroneous, is evident from experience, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5181",4705,"informs us, that the belief, attending any reasoning, consists in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5182",4705,"one conclusion, not in a multitude of similar ones, which would only","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5183",4705,"distract the mind, and in many cases would be too numerous to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5184",4705,"comprehended distinctly by any finite capacity. It remains, therefore,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5185",4705,"as the only reasonable opinion, that these similar views run into each","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5186",4705,"other, and unite their forces; so as to produce a stronger and clearer","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5207",4705,"WHICH CAN AFFORD US A REASON FOR DRAWING A CONCLUSION BEYOND it; and,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5212",4705,"so loose from all common systems, that they will make no difficulty of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5213",4705,"receiving any, which may appear the most extraordinary. These principles","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5214",4705,"we have found to be sufficiently convincing, even with regard to our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5215",4705,"most certain reasonings from causation: But I shall venture to affirm,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5216",4705,"that with regard to these conjectural or probable reasonings they still","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5217",4705,"acquire a new degree of evidence.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5218",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5219",4705,"First, It is obvious, that in reasonings of this kind, it is not the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5220",4705,"object presented to us, which, considered in itself, affords us any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5221",4705,"reason to draw a conclusion concerning any other object or event. For","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5222",4705,"as this latter object is supposed uncertain, and as the uncertainty is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5223",4705,"derived from a concealed contrariety of causes in the former, were any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5224",4705,"of the causes placed in the known qualities of that object, they would","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5225",4705,"no longer be concealed, nor would our conclusion be uncertain.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5226",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5227",4705,"But, secondly, it is equally obvious in this species of reasoning, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5228",4705,"if the transference of the past to the future were founded merely on a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5229",4705,"conclusion of the understanding, it coued never occasion any belief or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5230",4705,"assurance. When we transfer contrary experiments to the future, we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5231",4705,"can only repeat these contrary experiments with their particular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5232",4705,"proportions; which coued not produce assurance in any single event, upon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5233",4705,"which we reason, unless the fancy melted together all those images","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5234",4705,"that concur, and extracted from them one single idea or image, which is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5235",4705,"intense and lively in proportion to the number of experiments from which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5236",4705,"it is derived, and their superiority above their antagonists. Our past","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5237",4705,"experience presents no determinate object; and as our belief, however","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5238",4705,"faint, fixes itself on a determinate object, it is evident that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5239",4705,"belief arises not merely from the transference of past to future, but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5240",4705,"from some operation of the fancy conjoined with it. This may lead us","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5241",4705,"to conceive the manner, in which that faculty enters into all our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5242",4705,"reasonings.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5243",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5244",4705,"I shall conclude this subject with two reflections, which may deserve","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5245",4705,"our attention. The FIRST may be explained after this manner. When the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5246",4705,"mind forms a reasoning concerning any matter of fact, which is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5247",4705,"only probable, it casts its eye backward upon past experience, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5248",4705,"transferring it to the future, is presented with so many contrary","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5249",4705,"views of its object, of which those that are of the same kind uniting","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5250",4705,"together, and running into one act of the mind, serve to fortify and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5251",4705,"inliven it. But suppose that this multitude of views or glimpses of an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5252",4705,"object proceeds not from experience, but from a voluntary act of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5253",4705,"imagination; this effect does not follow, or at least, follows not in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5254",4705,"the same degree. For though custom and education produce belief by such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5255",4705,"a repetition, as is not derived from experience, yet this requires","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5256",4705,"a long tract of time, along with a very frequent and undesigned","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5257",4705,"repetition. In general we may pronounce, that a person who would","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5258",4705,"voluntarily repeat any idea in his mind, though supported by one past","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5259",4705,"experience, would be no more inclined to believe the existence of its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5260",4705,"object, than if he had contented himself with one survey of it.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5261",4705,"Beside the effect of design; each act of the mind, being separate and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5262",4705,"independent, has a separate influence, and joins not its force with that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5263",4705,"of its fellows. Not being united by any common object, producing them,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5264",4705,"they have no relation to each other; and consequently make no transition","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5265",4705,"or union of forces. This phaenomenon we shall understand better","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5266",4705,"afterwards.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5267",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5268",4705,"My second reflection is founded on those large probabilities, which the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5269",4705,"mind can judge of, and the minute differences it can observe betwixt","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5270",4705,"them. When the chances or experiments on one side amount to ten","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5271",4705,"thousand, and on the other to ten thousand and one, the judgment gives","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5272",4705,"the preference to the latter, upon account of that superiority; though","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5273",4705,"it is plainly impossible for the mind to run over every particular view,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5274",4705,"and distinguish the superior vivacity of the image arising from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5275",4705,"superior number, where the difference is so inconsiderable. We have a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5276",4705,"parallel instance in the affections. It is evident, according to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5277",4705,"principles above-mentioned, that when an object produces any passion in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5278",4705,"us, which varies according to the different quantity of the object; I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5279",4705,"say, it is evident, that the passion, properly speaking, is not a simple","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5280",4705,"emotion, but a compounded one, of a great number of weaker passions,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5281",4705,"derived from a view of each part of the object. For otherwise it were","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5282",4705,"impossible the passion should encrease by the encrease of these parts.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5283",4705,"Thus a man, who desires a thousand pound, has in reality a thousand","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5284",4705,"or more desires which uniting together, seem to make only one passion;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5285",4705,"though the composition evidently betrays itself upon every alteration of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5286",4705,"the object, by the preference he gives to the larger number, if superior","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5287",4705,"only by an unite. Yet nothing can be more certain, than that so small","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5288",4705,"a difference would not be discernible in the passions, nor coued render","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5289",4705,"them distinguishable from each other. The difference, therefore, of our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5290",4705,"conduct in preferring the greater number depends not upon our passions,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5291",4705,"but upon custom, and general rules. We have found in a multitude of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5292",4705,"instances, that the augmenting the numbers of any sum augments the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5293",4705,"passion, where the numbers are precise and the difference sensible. The","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5294",4705,"mind can perceive from its immediate feeling, that three guineas produce","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5295",4705,"a greater passion than two; and this it transfers to larger numbers,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5296",4705,"because of the resemblance; and by a general rule assigns to a thousand","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5297",4705,"guineas, a stronger passion than to nine hundred and ninety nine. These","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5298",4705,"general rules we shall explain presently.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5299",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5300",4705,"But beside these two species of probability, which a-re derived from an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5301",4705,"imperfect experience and from contrary causes, there is a third arising","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5302",4705,"from ANALOGY, which differs from them in some material circumstances.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5303",4705,"According to the hypothesis above explained all kinds of reasoning from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5304",4705,"causes or effects are founded on two particulars, viz., the constant","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5305",4705,"conjunction of any two objects in all past experience, and the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5306",4705,"resemblance of a present object to any one of them. The effect of these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5307",4705,"two particulars is, that the present object invigorates and inlivens the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5308",4705,"imagination; and the resemblance, along with the constant union, conveys","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5309",4705,"this force and vivacity to the related idea; which we are therefore said","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5310",4705,"to believe, or assent to. If you weaken either the union or resemblance,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5311",4705,"you weaken the principle of transition, and of consequence that belief,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5312",4705,"which arises from it. The vivacity of the first impression cannot be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5313",4705,"fully conveyed to the related idea, either where the conjunction of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5315",4705,"not perfectly resemble any of those, whose union we are accustomed to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5316",4705,"observe. In those probabilities of chance and causes above-explained,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5594",4705,"more singular and uncommon. The effect of this circumstance is, that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5615",4705,"committed, by affording us a just reason to blame and contemn the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5616",4705,"person, who injures us. But this phaenomenon likewise depends upon the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5618",4705,"unless it be, because we esteem it contrary to good breeding and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5630",4705,"flattery or satire, I shall add the consideration of another phenomenon,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5631",4705,"which is analogous to it. There are many particulars in the point of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5637",4705,"equivocal, than when they are direct and undeniable. The same idea is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5638",4705,"presented in both cases, and, properly speaking, is equally assented","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5639",4705,"to by the judgment; and yet its influence is different, because of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5724",4705,"examine that question, which [Sect. 2.] first occured to us, and which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5725",4705,"we dropt in our way, viz. What is our idea of necessity, when we say","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5726",4705,"that two objects are necessarily connected together. Upon this head I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5727",4705,"repeat what I have often had occasion to observe, that as we have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5728",4705,"no idea, that is not derived from an impression, we must find some","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5729",4705,"impression, that gives rise to this idea of necessity, if we assert we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5730",4705,"have really such an idea. In order to this I consider, in what objects","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5731",4705,"necessity is commonly supposed to lie; and finding that it is always","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5732",4705,"ascribed to causes and effects, I turn my eye to two objects supposed to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5733",4705,"be placed in that relation; and examine them in all the situations,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5734",4705,"of which they are susceptible. I immediately perceive, that they are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5735",4705,"contiguous in time and place, and that the object we call cause precedes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5736",4705,"the other we call effect. In no one instance can I go any farther,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5737",4705,"nor is it possible for me to discover any third relation betwixt these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5739",4705,"where I find like objects always existing in like relations of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5743",4705,"farther enquiry I find, that the repetition is not in every particular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5744",4705,"the same, but produces a new impression, and by that means the idea,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5745",4705,"which I at present examine. For after a frequent repetition, I find,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5776",4705,"of the controversy. This is what I find principally wanting in their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5778",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5779",4705,"I begin with observing that the terms of EFFICACY, AGENCY, POWER, FORCE,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5780",4705,"ENERGY, NECESSITY, CONNEXION, and PRODUCTIVE QUALITY, are all nearly","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5789",4705,"I believe the most general and most popular explication of this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5790",4705,"matter, is to say [See Mr. Locke, chapter of power.], that finding from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5794",4705,"this reasoning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinced","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5795",4705,"that this explication is more popular than philosophical, we need but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5796",4705,"reflect on two very obvious principles. First, That reason alone can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5797",4705,"never give rise to any original idea, and secondly, that reason, as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5799",4705,"or productive quality is absolutely requisite to every beginning of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5800",4705,"existence. Both these considerations have been sufficiently explained:","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5801",4705,"and therefore shall not at present be any farther insisted on.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5805",4705,"from some particular instances of this efficacy, which make their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5810",4705,"produce some instance, wherein the efficacy is plainly discoverable to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5880",4705,"reflect a moment on our present purpose in taking notice of it. We","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"5884",4705,"wherein this power is perceived to exert itself. Now, as these instances","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5885",4705,"can never be discovered in body, the Cartesians, proceeding upon their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5886",4705,"principle of innate ideas, have had recourse to a supreme spirit or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5887",4705,"deity, whom they consider as the only active being in the universe, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5888",4705,"as the immediate cause of every alteration in matter. But the principle","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5889",4705,"of innate ideas being allowed to be false, it follows, that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5890",4705,"supposition of a deity can serve us in no stead, in accounting for that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5891",4705,"idea of agency, which we search for in vain in all the objects, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5892",4705,"are presented to our senses, or which we are internally conscious of in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5893",4705,"our own minds. For if every idea be derived from an impression, the idea","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5894",4705,"of a deity proceeds from the same origin; and if no impression, either","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5895",4705,"of sensation or reflection, implies any force or efficacy, it is equally","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"5896",4705,"impossible to discover or even imagine any such active principle in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6000",4705,"cause and the other the effect; it is plain, that from the simple","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6001",4705,"consideration of one, or both these objects we never shall perceive the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6002",4705,"tie by which they are united, or be able certainly to pronounce, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6005",4705,"connexion of power, of force, of energy, and of efficacy. Did we never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6006",4705,"see any but particular conjunctions of objects, entirely different from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6007",4705,"each other, we should never be able to form any such ideas.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6008",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6009",4705,"But again; suppose we observe several instances, in which the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6010",4705,"objects are always conjoined together, we immediately conceive a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6011",4705,"connexion betwixt them, and begin to draw an inference from one","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6012",4705,"to another. This multiplicity of resembling instances, therefore,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6013",4705,"constitutes the very essence of power or connexion, and is the source","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6014",4705,"from which the idea of it arises. In order, then, to understand the idea","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6015",4705,"of power, we must consider that multiplicity; nor do I ask more to give","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6016",4705,"a solution of that difficulty, which has so long perplexed us. For thus","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6017",4705,"I reason. The repetition of perfectly similar instances can never alone","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6018",4705,"give rise to an original idea, different from what is to be found in any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6019",4705,"particular instance, as has been observed, and as evidently follows from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6020",4705,"our fundamental principle, that all ideas are copyed from impressions.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6021",4705,"Since therefore the idea of power is a new original idea, not to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6022",4705,"found in any one instance, and which yet arises from the repetition of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6023",4705,"several instances, it follows, that the repetition alone has not that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6024",4705,"effect, but must either discover or produce something new, which is the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6025",4705,"source of that idea. Did the repetition neither discover nor produce","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6026",4705,"anything new, our ideas might be multiplyed by it, but would not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6027",4705,"be enlarged above what they are upon the observation of one single","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6028",4705,"instance. Every enlargement, therefore, (such as the idea of power or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6029",4705,"connexion) which arises from the multiplicity of similar instances,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6030",4705,"is copyed from some effects of the multiplicity, and will be perfectly","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6031",4705,"understood by understanding these effects. Wherever we find anything new","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6032",4705,"to be discovered or produced by the repetition, there we must place the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6033",4705,"power, and must never look for it in any other object.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6034",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6038",4705,"it a subject either of our demonstrative or probable reasonings;[Sect.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6040",4705,"it would be of no consequence in the present case; since no kind of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6041",4705,"reasoning can give rise to a new idea, such as this of power is; but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6042",4705,"wherever we reason, we must antecedently be possest of clear ideas,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6043",4705,"which may be the objects of our reasoning. The conception always","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6047",4705,"Secondly, It is certain that this repetition of similar objects in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6062",4705,"resemblance, that the ideas of necessity, of power, and of efficacy, are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6065",4705,"an argument, which, in every view we can examine it, will be found","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6066",4705,"perfectly unanswerable. Similar instances are still the first source","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6270",4705,"popular errors, that have very much prevailed in philosophy. First, We","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6271",4705,"may learn from the foregoing, doctrine, that all causes are of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6272",4705,"same kind, and that in particular there is no foundation for that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6273",4705,"distinction, which we sometimes make betwixt efficient causes and causes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6274",4705,"sine qua non; or betwixt efficient causes, and formal, and material, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6275",4705,"exemplary, and final causes. For as our idea of efficiency is derived","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6276",4705,"from the constant conjunction of two objects, wherever this is observed,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6277",4705,"the cause is efficient; and where it is not, there can never be a cause","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6278",4705,"of any kind. For the same reason we must reject the distinction betwixt","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6279",4705,"cause and occasion, when supposed to signify any thing essentially","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6280",4705,"different from each other. If constant conjunction be implyed in what we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6281",4705,"call occasion, it is a real cause. If not, it is no relation at all, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6883",4705,"possible it should be otherwise, nor is it conceivable that our senses","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6884",4705,"should be more capable of deceiving us in the situation and relations,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6885",4705,"than in the nature of our impressions. For since all actions and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6886",4705,"sensations of the mind are known to us by consciousness, they must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6887",4705,"necessarily appear in every particular what they are, and be what they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6890",4705,"to suppose, that even where we are most intimately conscious, we might","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6891",4705,"be mistaken.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6892",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6893",4705,"But not to lose time in examining, whether it is possible for our senses","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6894",4705,"to deceive us, and represent our perceptions as distinct from ourselves,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6895",4705,"that is as external to and independent of us; let us consider whether","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6896",4705,"they really do so, and whether this error proceeds from an immediate","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6897",4705,"sensation, or from some other causes.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6898",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6899",4705,"To begin with the question concerning EXTERNAL existence, it may perhaps","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6900",4705,"be said, that setting aside the metaphysical question of the identity","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6901",4705,"of a thinking substance, our own body evidently belongs to us; and as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6902",4705,"several impressions appear exterior to the body, we suppose them also","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6903",4705,"exterior to ourselves. The paper, on which I write at present, is beyond","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6904",4705,"my hand. The table is beyond the paper. The walls of the chamber beyond","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6905",4705,"the table. And in casting my eye towards the window, I perceive a great","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6906",4705,"extent of fields and buildings beyond my chamber. From all this it may","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6907",4705,"be infered, that no other faculty is required, beside the senses, to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6908",4705,"convince us of the external existence of body. But to prevent this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6909",4705,"inference, we need only weigh the three following considerations. First,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6910",4705,"That, properly speaking, it is not our body we perceive, when we regard","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6911",4705,"our limbs and members, but certain impressions, which enter by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6912",4705,"senses; so that the ascribing a real and corporeal existence to these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6913",4705,"impressions, or to their objects, is an act of the mind as difficult","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6914",4705,"to explain, as that which we examine at present. Secondly, Sounds, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6915",4705,"tastes, and smelts, though commonly regarded by the mind as continued","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6916",4705,"independent qualities, appear not to have any existence in extension,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6917",4705,"and consequently cannot appear to the senses as situated externally","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6918",4705,"to the body. The reason, why we ascribe a place to them, shall be:","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6919",4705,"considered afterwards. Thirdly, Even our sight informs us not of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6920",4705,"distance or outness (so to speak) immediately and without a certain","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6921",4705,"reasoning and experience, as is acknowledged by the most rational","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6922",4705,"philosophers.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6923",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6924",4705,"As to the independency of our perceptions on ourselves, this can never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6925",4705,"be an object of the senses; but any opinion we form concerning it, must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6926",4705,"be derived from experience and observation: And we shall see afterwards,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6927",4705,"that our conclusions from experience are far from being favourable to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6928",4705,"the doctrine of the independency of our perceptions. Mean while we may","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6929",4705,"observe that when we talk of real distinct existences, we have commonly","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6930",4705,"more in our eye their independency than external situation in place,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6931",4705,"and think an object has a sufficient reality, when its Being is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6932",4705,"uninterrupted, and independent of the incessant revolutions, which we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6933",4705,"are conscious of in ourselves.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6934",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6935",4705,"Thus to resume what I have said concerning the senses; they give us no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6936",4705,"notion of continued existence, because they cannot operate beyond the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6937",4705,"extent, in which they really operate. They as little produce the opinion","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6938",4705,"of a distinct existence, because they neither can offer it to the mind","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6939",4705,"as represented, nor as original. To offer it as represented, they must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6940",4705,"present both an object and an image. To make it appear as original, they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6941",4705,"must convey a falshood; and this falshood must lie in the relations and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6942",4705,"situation: In order to which they must be able to compare the object","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6943",4705,"with ourselves; and even in that case they do not, nor is it possible","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6944",4705,"they should, deceive us. We may, therefore, conclude with certainty,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6945",4705,"that the opinion of a continued and of a distinct existence never arises","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6946",4705,"from the senses.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6947",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6948",4705,"To confirm this we may observe, that there are three different kinds of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6949",4705,"impressions conveyed by the senses. The first are those of the figure,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6950",4705,"bulk, motion and solidity of bodies. The second those of colours,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6951",4705,"tastes, smells, sounds, heat and cold. The third are the pains and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6952",4705,"pleasures, that arise from the application of objects to our bodies, as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6953",4705,"by the cutting of our flesh with steel, and such like. Both philosophers","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6954",4705,"and the vulgar suppose the first of these to have a distinct continued","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6955",4705,"existence. The vulgar only regard the second as on the same footing.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6956",4705,"Both philosophers and the vulgar, again, esteem the third to be merely","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6958",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6959",4705,"Now it is evident, that, whatever may be our philosophical opinion,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6960",4705,"colours, Sounds, heat and cold, as far as appears to the senses, exist","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6961",4705,"after the same manner with motion and solidity, and that the difference","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6962",4705,"we make betwixt them in this respect, arises not from the mere","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6963",4705,"perception. So strong the prejudice for the distinct continued existence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6964",4705,"Of the former qualities, that when the contrary opinion is advanced by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6965",4705,"modern philosophers, people imagine they can almost refute it from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6966",4705,"their feeling and experience, and that their very senses contradict this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"6968",4705,"on the same footing with the pain that arises from steel, and pleasure","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6969",4705,"that proceeds from a fire; and that the difference betwixt them is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6970",4705,"founded neither on perception nor reason, but on the imagination. For","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6971",4705,"as they are confest to be, both of them, nothing but perceptions arising","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6972",4705,"from the particular configurations and motions of the parts of body,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6973",4705,"wherein possibly can their difference consist? Upon the whole, then, we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6974",4705,"may conclude, that as far as the senses are judges, all perceptions are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6975",4705,"the same in the manner of their existence.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6976",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6977",4705,"We may also observe in this instance of sounds and colours, that we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6978",4705,"can attribute a distinct continued existence to objects without ever","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6979",4705,"consulting REASON, or weighing our opinions by any philosophical","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6980",4705,"principles. And indeed, whatever convincing arguments philosophers may","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6981",4705,"fancy they can produce to establish the belief of objects independent of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6982",4705,"the mind, it is obvious these arguments are known but to very few, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6983",4705,"that it is not by them, that children, peasants, and the greatest part","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6984",4705,"of mankind are induced to attribute objects to some impressions, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6985",4705,"deny them to others. Accordingly we find, that all the conclusions,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6986",4705,"which the vulgar form on this head, are directly contrary to those,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6987",4705,"which are confirmed by philosophy. For philosophy informs us, that every","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6988",4705,"thing, which appears to the mind, is nothing but a perception, and is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6989",4705,"interrupted, and dependent on the mind: whereas the vulgar confound","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6990",4705,"perceptions and objects, and attribute a distinct continued existence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6991",4705,"to the very things they feel or see. This sentiment, then, as it is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6992",4705,"entirely unreasonable, must proceed from some other faculty than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6993",4705,"the understanding. To which we may add, that as long as we take our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6994",4705,"perceptions and objects to be the same, we can never infer the existence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6995",4705,"of the one from that of the other, nor form any argument from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6996",4705,"relation of cause and effect; which is the only one that earl assure us","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6997",4705,"of matter of fact. Even after we distinguish our perceptions from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6998",4705,"our objects, it will appear presently, that we are still incapable of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"6999",4705,"reasoning from the existence of one to that of the other: So that upon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7000",4705,"the whole our reason neither does, nor is it possible it ever should,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7001",4705,"upon any supposition, give us an assurance of the continued and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7008",4705,"imagination, and since this notion does not extend to all of them, it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7074",4705,"indeed, informs me of the existence of many objects; but then this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7083",4705,"all past experience, unless the door, which I remember on the other side","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7085",4705,"body was possest of a quality, which I call gravity, and which hinders","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7087",4705,"at my chamber, unless the stairs I remember be not annihilated by my","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7088",4705,"absence. But this is not all. I receive a letter, which upon, opening","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7089",4705,"it I perceive by the hand-writing and subscription to have come from a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7090",4705,"friend, who says he is two hundred leagues distant. It is evident I can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7091",4705,"never account for this phenomenon, conformable to my experience in other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7095",4705,"these phaenomena of the porter and letter in a certain light, they are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7096",4705,"contradictions to common experience, and may be regarded as objections","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7097",4705,"to those maxims, which we form concerning the connexions of causes and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7098",4705,"effects. I am accustomed to hear such a sound, and see such an object in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7099",4705,"motion at the same time. I have not received in this particular instance","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7100",4705,"both these perceptions. These observations are contrary, unless I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7109",4705,"found by experience to be suitable to their particular natures and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7111",4705,"something real and durable, and as preserving its existence, even when","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7114",4705,"But though this conclusion from the coherence of appearances may seem to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7116",4705,"as being derived from custom, and regulated by past experience; we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7118",4705,"different from each other, and that this inference arises from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7119",4705,"understanding, and from custom in an indirect and oblique manner. For","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7120",4705,"it will readily be allowed, that since nothing is ever really present to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7121",4705,"the mind, besides its own perceptions, it is not only impossible,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7122",4705,"that any habit should ever be acquired otherwise than by the regular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7123",4705,"succession of these perceptions, but also that any habit should ever","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7125",4705,"in our perceptions, can never be a foundation for us to infer a greater","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7126",4705,"degree of regularity in some objects, which are not perceived; since","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7127",4705,"this supposes a contradiction, viz. a habit acquired by what was never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7129",4705,"continued existence of the objects of sense from their coherence, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7130",4705,"the frequency of their union, it is in order to bestow on the objects","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7131",4705,"a greater regularity than what is observed in our mere perceptions. We","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7134",4705,"perfectly constant, since the turning about of our head or the shutting","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7136",4705,"case, but that these objects still continue their usual connexion,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7137",4705,"notwithstanding their apparent interruption, and that the irregular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7143",4705,"from the co-operation of some other principles.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7144",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7145",4705,"I have already observed [Part II, Sect. 4.], in examining the foundation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7146",4705,"of mathematics, that the imagination, when set into any train of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7147",4705,"thinking, is apt to continue, even when its object fails it, and like a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7148",4705,"galley put in motion by the oars, carries on its course without any new","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7149",4705,"impulse. This I have assigned for the reason, why, after considering","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7150",4705,"several loose standards of equality, and correcting them by each other,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7151",4705,"we proceed to imagine so correct and exact a standard of that relation,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7152",4705,"as is not liable to the least error or variation. The same principle","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7153",4705,"makes us easily entertain this opinion of the continued existence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7154",4705,"of body. Objects have a certain coherence even as they appear to our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7155",4705,"senses; but this coherence is much greater and more uniform, if we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7157",4705,"once in the train of observing an uniformity among objects, it naturally","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7158",4705,"continues, till it renders the uniformity as compleat as possible.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7159",4705,"The simple supposition of their continued existence suffices for this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7164",4705,"is too weak to support alone so vast an edifice, as is that of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7165",4705,"continued existence of all external bodies; and that we must join the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7166",4705,"constancy of their appearance to the coherence, in order to give a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7167",4705,"satisfactory account of that opinion. As the explication of this will","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7168",4705,"lead me into a considerable compass of very profound reasoning; I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7203",4705,"the propensity.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7204",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7205",4705,"First, As to the principle of individuation; we may observe, that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7206",4705,"view of any one object is not sufficient to convey the idea of identity.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7207",4705,"For in that proposition, an object is the same with itself, if the idea","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7211",4705,"in this affirmation. One single object conveys the idea of unity, not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7212",4705,"that of identity.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7213",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7214",4705,"On the other hand, a multiplicity of objects can never convey this idea,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7215",4705,"however resembling they may be supposed. The mind always pronounces the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7216",4705,"one not to be the other, and considers them as forming two, three,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7219",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7220",4705,"Since then both number and unity are incompatible with the relation of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7221",4705,"identity, it must lie in something that is neither of them. But to tell","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7222",4705,"the truth, at first sight this seems utterly impossible. Betwixt unity","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7223",4705,"and number there can be no medium; no more than betwixt existence and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7224",4705,"nonexistence. After one object is supposed to exist, we must either","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7225",4705,"suppose another also to exist; in which case we have the idea of number:","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7228",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7229",4705,"To remove this difficulty, let us have recourse to the idea of time or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7230",4705,"duration. I have already observd [Part II, Sect. 5.], that time, in a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7233",4705,"which the unchangeable object is supposd to participate of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7234",4705,"changes of the co-existent objects, and in particular of that of our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7235",4705,"perceptions. This fiction of the imagination almost universally takes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7236",4705,"place; and it is by means of it, that a single object, placd before us,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7237",4705,"and surveyd for any time without our discovering in it any interruption","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7238",4705,"or variation, is able to give us a notion of identity. For when we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7239",4705,"consider any two points of this time, we may place them in different","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7240",4705,"lights: We may either survey them at the very same instant; in which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7333",4705,"with each other, and upon the appearance of one, to facilitate the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7423",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7424",4705,"We may begin with observing, that the difficulty in the present case","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7425",4705,"is not concerning the matter of fact, or whether the mind forms such a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7426",4705,"conclusion concerning the continued existence of its perceptions,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7427",4705,"but only concerning the manner in which the conclusion is formed, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7428",4705,"principles from which it is derived. It is certain, that almost all","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7429",4705,"mankind, and even philosophers themselves, for the greatest part of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7430",4705,"their lives, take their perceptions to be their only objects, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7431",4705,"suppose, that the very being, which is intimately present to the mind,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7432",4705,"is the real body or material existence. It is also certain, that this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7433",4705,"very perception or object is supposed to have a continued uninterrupted","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7434",4705,"being, and neither to be annihilated by our absence, nor to be brought","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7435",4705,"into existence by our presence. When we are absent from it, we say it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7436",4705,"still exists, but that we do not feel, we do not see it. When we are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7437",4705,"present, we say we feel, or see it. Here then may arise two questions;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7438",4705,"First, How we can satisfy ourselves in supposing a perception to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7439",4705,"absent from the mind without being annihilated. Secondly, After what","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7440",4705,"manner we conceive an object to become present to the mind, without some","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7441",4705,"new creation of a perception or image; and what we mean by this seeing,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7443",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7444",4705,"As to the first question; we may observe, that what we call a mind,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7445",4705,"is nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions, united","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7446",4705,"together by certain relations, and supposed, though falsely, to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7447",4705,"endowed with a perfect simplicity and identity. Now as every perception","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7448",4705,"is distinguishable from another, and may be considered as separately","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7449",4705,"existent; it evidently follows, that there is no absurdity in separating","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7450",4705,"any particular perception from the mind; that is, in breaking off all","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7467",4705,"no contradiction. We may easily indulge our inclination to that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7474",4705,"question is, from whence arises such a belief; and this question leads","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7475",4705,"us to the fourth member of this system. It has been proved already, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7476",4705,"belief in general consists in nothing, but the vivacity of an idea; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7477",4705,"that an idea may acquire this vivacity by its relation to some present","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7478",4705,"impression. Impressions are naturally the most vivid perceptions of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7479",4705,"the mind; and this quality is in part conveyed by the relation to every","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7480",4705,"connected idea. The relation causes a smooth passage from the impression","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7481",4705,"to the idea, and even gives a propensity to that passage. The mind falls","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7482",4705,"so easily from the one perception to the other, that it scarce perceives","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7483",4705,"the change, but retains in the second a considerable share of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7484",4705,"vivacity of the first. It is excited by the lively impression; and this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7485",4705,"vivacity is conveyed to the related idea, without any great diminution","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7486",4705,"in the passage, by reason of the smooth transition and the propensity of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7491",4705,"effect, and convey the vivacity from the impression to the idea. Now","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7492",4705,"this is exactly the present case. Our memory presents us with a vast","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7493",4705,"number of instances of perceptions perfectly resembling each other,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7494",4705,"that return at different distances of time, and after considerable","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7495",4705,"interruptions. This resemblance gives us a propension to consider these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7496",4705,"interrupted perceptions as the same; and also a propension to connect","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7497",4705,"them by a continued existence, in order to justify this identity, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7498",4705,"avoid the contradiction, in which the interrupted appearance of these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7499",4705,"perceptions seems necessarily to involve us. Here then we have a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7500",4705,"propensity to feign the continued existence of all sensible objects; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7501",4705,"as this propensity arises from some lively impressions of the memory, it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7502",4705,"bestows a vivacity on that fiction: or in other words, makes us believe","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7503",4705,"the continued existence of body. If sometimes we ascribe a continued","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7504",4705,"existence to objects, which are perfectly new to us, and of whose","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7505",4705,"constancy and coherence we have no experience, it is because the manner,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7506",4705,"in which they present themselves to our senses, resembles that of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7507",4705,"constant and coherent objects; and this resemblance is a source of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7508",4705,"reasoning and analogy, and leads us to attribute the same qualities to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7509",4705,"similar objects.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7510",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7511",4705,"I believe an intelligent reader will find less difficulty to assent to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7512",4705,"this system, than to comprehend it fully and distinctly, and will allow,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7513",4705,"after a little reflection, that every part carries its own proof","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7514",4705,"along with it. It is indeed evident, that as the vulgar suppose their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7515",4705,"perceptions to be their only objects, and at the same time believe the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7516",4705,"continued existence of matter, we must account for the origin of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7517",4705,"belief upon that supposition. Now upon that supposition, it is a false","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7518",4705,"opinion that any of our objects, or perceptions, are identically the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7519",4705,"same after an interruption; and consequently the opinion of their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7520",4705,"identity can never arise from reason, but must arise from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7521",4705,"imagination. The imagination is seduced into such an opinion only by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7522",4705,"means of the resemblance of certain perceptions; since we find they are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7523",4705,"only our resembling perceptions, which we have a propension to suppose","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7524",4705,"the same. This propension to bestow an identity on our resembling","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7525",4705,"perceptions, produces the fiction of a continued existence; since that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7526",4705,"fiction, as well as the identity, is really false, as is acknowledged","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7527",4705,"by all philosophers, and has no other effect than to remedy the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7528",4705,"interruption of our perceptions, which is the only circumstance that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7529",4705,"is contrary to their identity. In the last place this propension causes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7530",4705,"belief by means of the present impressions of the memory; since without","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7531",4705,"the remembrance of former sensations, it is plain we never should have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7532",4705,"any belief of the continued existence of body. Thus in examining all","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7533",4705,"these parts, we find that each of them is supported by the strongest","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7534",4705,"proofs: and that all of them together form a consistent system, which is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7535",4705,"perfectly convincing. A strong propensity or inclination alone, without","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7536",4705,"any present impression, will sometimes cause a belief or opinion. How","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7538",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7541",4705,"objects or perceptions, which we find to resemble each other in their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7542",4705,"interrupted appearance; yet a very little reflection and philosophy","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7543",4705,"is sufficient to make us perceive the fallacy of that opinion. I have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7544",4705,"already observed, that there is an intimate connexion betwixt those two","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7545",4705,"principles, of a continued and of a distinct or independent existence,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7546",4705,"and that we no sooner establish the one than the other follows, as a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7547",4705,"necessary consequence. It is the opinion of a continued existence, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7548",4705,"first takes place, and without much study or reflection draws the other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7549",4705,"along with it, wherever the mind follows its first and most natural","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7550",4705,"tendency. But when we compare experiments, and reason a little upon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7551",4705,"them, we quickly perceive, that the doctrine of the independent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7552",4705,"existence of our sensible perceptions is contrary to the plainest","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7553",4705,"experience. This leads us backward upon our footsteps to perceive our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7554",4705,"error in attributing a continued existence to our perceptions, and is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7555",4705,"the origin of many very curious opinions, which we shall here endeavour","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7556",4705,"to account for.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7559",4705,"convince us, that our perceptions are not possest of any independent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7560",4705,"existence. When we press one eye with a finger, we immediately perceive","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7561",4705,"all the objects to become double, and one half of them to be removed","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7562",4705,"from their common and natural position. But as we do not attribute to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7563",4705,"continued existence to both these perceptions, and as they are both","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7564",4705,"of the same nature, we clearly perceive, that all our perceptions are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7565",4705,"dependent on our organs, and the disposition of our nerves and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7566",4705,"animal spirits. This opinion is confirmed by the seeming encrease and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7567",4705,"diminution of objects, according to their distance; by the apparent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7600",4705,"imagination, we may soon satisfy ourselves with regard to reason by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7603",4705,"command our strongest assent, and are the first foundation of all our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7604",4705,"conclusions. The only conclusion we can draw from the existence of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7605",4705,"one thing to that of another, is by means of the relation of cause and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7699",4705,"philosophical, one of the double existence of perceptions and objects;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7700",4705,"which pleases our reason, in allowing, that our dependent perceptions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7702",4705,"imagination, in attributing a continued existence to something else,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7705",4705,"other, which are both at once embraced by the mind, and which are unable","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7706",4705,"mutually to destroy each other. The imagination tells us, that our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7707",4705,"resembling perceptions have a continued and uninterrupted existence, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7708",4705,"are not annihilated by their absence. Reflection tells us, that even our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7713",4705,"existences; the interruption to perceptions, and the continuance to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7716",4705,"in the point, that there is no possibility of disguising her. Not being","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7718",4705,"ease as much as possible, by successively granting to each whatever","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7720",4705,"something, that has all the conditions it desires. Were we fully","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7721",4705,"convinced, that our resembling perceptions are continued, and identical,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7722",4705,"and independent, we should never run into this opinion of a double","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7723",4705,"existence, since we should find satisfaction in our first supposition,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7724",4705,"and would not look beyond. Again, were we fully convinced, that our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7725",4705,"perceptions are dependent, and interrupted, and different, we should be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7726",4705,"as little inclined to embrace the opinion of a double existence;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7727",4705,"since in that case we should clearly perceive the error of our first","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7728",4705,"supposition of a continued existence, and would never regard it any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7729",4705,"farther. It is therefore from the intermediate situation of the mind,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7730",4705,"that this opinion arises, and from such an adherence to these two","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7731",4705,"contrary principles, as makes us seek some pretext to justify our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7732",4705,"receiving both; which happily at last is found in the system of a double","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7734",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7735",4705,"Another advantage of this philosophical system is its similarity to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7736",4705,"vulgar one; by which means we can humour our reason for a moment,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7738",4705,"negligence or inattention, can easily return to our vulgar and natural","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7740",4705,"advantage; but immediately upon leaving their closets, mingle with the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7741",4705,"rest of mankind in those exploded opinions, that our perceptions are our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7742",4705,"only objects, and continue identically and uninterruptedly the same in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7744",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7745",4705,"There are other particulars of this system, wherein we may remark its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7746",4705,"dependence on the fancy, in a very conspicuous manner. Of these, I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7747",4705,"shall observe the two following. First, We suppose external objects to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7748",4705,"resemble internal perceptions. I have already shewn, that the relation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7749",4705,"of cause and effect can never afford us any just conclusion from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7750",4705,"existence or qualities of our perceptions to the existence of external","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7751",4705,"continued objects: And I shall farther add, that even though they coued","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7752",4705,"afford such a conclusion, we should never have any reason to infer,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7753",4705,"that our objects resemble our perceptions. That opinion, therefore, is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7754",4705,"derived from nothing but the quality of the fancy above-explained, <that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7755",4705,"it borrows all its ideas from some precedent perception>. We never can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7756",4705,"conceive any thing but perceptions, and therefore must make every thing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7757",4705,"resemble them.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7758",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7759",4705,"Secondly, As we suppose our objects in general to resemble our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7760",4705,"perceptions, so we take it for granted, that every particular object","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7761",4705,"resembles that perception, which it causes. The relation of cause and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7762",4705,"effect determines us to join the other of resemblance; and the ideas","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7763",4705,"of these existences being already united together in the fancy by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7764",4705,"former relation, we naturally add the latter to compleat the union.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7765",4705,"We have a strong propensity to compleat every union by joining new","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7766",4705,"relations to those which we have before observed betwixt any ideas, as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7767",4705,"we shall have occasion to observe presently. [Sect. 5.]","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7768",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7769",4705,"Having thus given an account of all the systems both popular and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7770",4705,"philosophical, with regard to external existences, I cannot forbear","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7771",4705,"giving vent to a certain sentiment, which arises upon reviewing those","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7772",4705,"systems. I begun this subject with premising, that we ought to have an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7773",4705,"implicit faith in our senses, and that this would be the conclusion, I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7774",4705,"should draw from the whole of my reasoning. But to be ingenuous, I feel","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7775",4705,"myself at present of a quite contrary sentiment, and am more inclined","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7776",4705,"to repose no faith at all in my senses, or rather imagination, than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7777",4705,"to place in it such an implicit confidence. I cannot conceive how such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7778",4705,"trivial qualities of the fancy, conducted by such false suppositions,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7779",4705,"can ever lead to any solid and rational system. They are the coherence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7780",4705,"and constancy of our perceptions, which produce the opinion of their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7781",4705,"continued existence; though these qualities of perceptions have no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7782",4705,"perceivable connexion with such an existence. The constancy of our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7783",4705,"perceptions has the most considerable effect, and yet is attended with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7784",4705,"the greatest difficulties. It is a gross illusion to suppose, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7785",4705,"our resembling perceptions are numerically the same; and it is this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7786",4705,"illusion, which leads us into the opinion, that these perceptions are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7787",4705,"uninterrupted, and are still existent, even when they are not present","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7788",4705,"to the senses. This is the case with our popular system. And as to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7789",4705,"our philosophical one, it is liable to the same difficulties; and is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7790",4705,"over-and-above loaded with this absurdity, that it at once denies and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7791",4705,"establishes the vulgar supposition. Philosophers deny our resembling","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7792",4705,"perceptions to be identically the same, and uninterrupted; and yet have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7793",4705,"so great a propensity to believe them such, that they arbitrarily invent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7794",4705,"a new set of perceptions, to which they attribute these qualities. I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7795",4705,"say, a new set of perceptions: For we may well suppose in general, but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7796",4705,"it is impossible for us distinctly to conceive, objects to be in their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7797",4705,"nature any thing but exactly the same with perceptions. What then can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7799",4705,"but error and falshood? And how can we justify to ourselves any belief","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"7801",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"7802",4705,"This sceptical doubt, both with respect to reason and the senses, is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8132",4705,"is impossible to conceive extension, but as composed of parts, endowed","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8140",4705,"can the former be just while the latter is chimerical. Let us, then,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8141",4705,"lend our attention to the examination of the idea of solidity.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8142",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8143",4705,"The idea of solidity is that of two objects, which being impelled by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8144",4705,"utmost force, cannot penetrate each other; but still maintain a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8145",4705,"separate and distinct existence. Solidity, therefore, is perfectly","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8148",4705,"idea have we of these bodies? The ideas of colours, sounds, and other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8149",4705,"secondary qualities are excluded. The idea of motion depends on that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8150",4705,"of extension, and the idea of extension on that of solidity. It is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8151",4705,"impossible, therefore, that the idea of solidity can depend on either of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8153",4705,"another, while at the same time the latter depends on the former. Our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8154",4705,"modern philosophy, therefore, leaves us no just nor satisfactory idea of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8159",4705,"generality of readers, I hope to be excused, if I endeavour to render","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8160",4705,"it more obvious by some variation of the expression. In order to form","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8161",4705,"an idea of solidity, we must conceive two bodies pressing on each other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8162",4705,"without any penetration; and it is impossible to arrive at this idea,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8163",4705,"when we confine ourselves to one object, much more without conceiving","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8164",4705,"any. Two non-entities cannot exclude each other from their places;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8165",4705,"because they never possess any place, nor can be endowed with any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8166",4705,"quality. Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8167",4705,"to which we suppose solidity to belong? To say, that we conceive them","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8168",4705,"merely as solid, is to run on in infinitum. To affirm, that we paint","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8169",4705,"them out to ourselves as extended, either resolves all into a false","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8170",4705,"idea, or returns in a circle. Extension must necessarily be considered","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8171",4705,"either as coloured, which is a false idea; I or as solid, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8172",4705,"brings us back to the first question. We may make the same observation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8175",4705,"external existences, there remains nothing, which can afford us a just","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8177",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8178",4705,"Add to this, that, properly speaking, solidity or impenetrability is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8179",4705,"nothing, but an impossibility of annihilation, as [Part II. Sect. 4.]","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8180",4705,"has been already observed: For which reason it is the more necessary","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8181",4705,"for us to form some distinct idea of that object, whose annihilation we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8185",4705,"the difficulty still remains, how to form an idea of this object","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8187",4705,"qualities.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8188",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8189",4705,"Nor must we omit on this occasion our accustomed method of examining","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8190",4705,"ideas by considering those impressions, from which they are derived. The","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8191",4705,"impressions, which enter by the sight and hearing, the smell and taste,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8192",4705,"are affirmed by modern philosophy to be without any resembling objects;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8193",4705,"and consequently the idea of solidity, which is supposed to be real, can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8194",4705,"never be derived from any of these senses. There remains, therefore,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8195",4705,"the feeling as the only sense, that can convey the impression, which is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8196",4705,"original to the idea of solidity; and indeed we naturally imagine, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8197",4705,"we feel the solidity of bodies, and need but touch any object in order","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8198",4705,"to perceive this quality. But this method of thinking is more popular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8199",4705,"than philosophical; as will appear from the following reflections.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8200",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8201",4705,"First, It is easy to observe, that though bodies are felt by means of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8202",4705,"their solidity, yet the feeling is a quite different thing from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8203",4705,"solidity; and that they have not the least resemblance to each other.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8204",4705,"A man, who has the palsey in one hand, has as perfect an idea of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8205",4705,"impenetrability, when he observes that hand to be supported by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8206",4705,"table, as when he feels the same table with the other hand. An object,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8207",4705,"that presses upon any of our members, meets with resistance; and that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8208",4705,"resistance, by the motion it gives to the nerves and animal spirits,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8209",4705,"conveys a certain sensation to the mind; but it does not follow, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8210",4705,"the sensation, motion, and resistance are any ways resembling.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8211",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8212",4705,"Secondly, The impressions of touch are simple impressions, except when","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8213",4705,"considered with regard to their extension; which makes nothing to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8214",4705,"present purpose: And from this simplicity I infer, that they neither","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8215",4705,"represent solidity, nor any real object. For let us put two cases, viz.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8216",4705,"that of a man, who presses a stone, or any solid body, with his hand,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8217",4705,"and that of two stones, which press each other; it will readily be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8218",4705,"allowed, that these two cases are not in every respect alike, but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8219",4705,"that in the former there is conjoined with the solidity, a feeling or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8220",4705,"sensation, of which there is no appearance in the latter. In order,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8221",4705,"therefore, to make these two cases alike, it is necessary to remove some","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8222",4705,"part of the impression, which the man feels by his hand, or organ of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8223",4705,"sensation; and that being impossible in a simple impression, obliges","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8224",4705,"us to remove the whole, and proves that this whole impression has","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8225",4705,"no archetype or model in external objects. To which we may add, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8226",4705,"solidity necessarily supposes two bodies, along with contiguity and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8227",4705,"impulse; which being a compound object, can never be represented by a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8228",4705,"simple impression. Not to mention, that though solidity continues always","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8229",4705,"invariably the same, the impressions of touch change every moment upon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8230",4705,"us; which is a clear proof that the latter are not representations of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8231",4705,"the former.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8232",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8233",4705,"Thus there is a direct and total opposition betwixt our reason and our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8298",4705,"is clearly conceived, after any manner, may exist after the same manner.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8299",4705,"This is one principle, which has been already acknowledged. Again, every","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8300",4705,"thing, which is different, is distinguishable, and every thing which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8301",4705,"is distinguishable, is separable by the imagination. This is another","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8302",4705,"principle. My conclusion from both is, that since all our perceptions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8303",4705,"are different from each other, and from every thing else in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8304",4705,"universe, they are also distinct and separable, and may be considered as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8305",4705,"separately existent, and may exist separately, and have no need of any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8332",4705,"somewhere within its dimensions. If it exist within its dimensions, it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8333",4705,"must either exist in one particular part; and then that particular part","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8336",4705,"extended, and separable, and divisible, as well as the body; which is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8659",4705,"the simplicity and immateriality o the soul, without preparing the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8661",4705,"instead o calling thought a modification of the soul, we should give it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8662",4705,"the more antient, and yet more modish name of an action. By an action we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8669",4705,"from the two following reflexions.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8670",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8671",4705,"First, I observe, that the word, action, according to this explication","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8672",4705,"of it, can never justly be applied to any perception, as derived from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8673",4705,"a mind or thinking substance. Our perceptions are all really different,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8674",4705,"and separable, and distinguishable from each other, and from everything","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8676",4705,"how they can be the action or abstract mode of any substance. The","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8677",4705,"instance of motion, which is commonly made use of to shew after what","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8678",4705,"manner perception depends, as an action, upon its substance, rather","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8679",4705,"confounds than instructs us. Motion to all appearance induces no real","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8680",4705,"nor essential change on the body, but only varies its relation to other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8681",4705,"objects. But betwixt a person in the morning walking a garden with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8682",4705,"company, agreeable to him; and a person in the afternoon inclosed in a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8683",4705,"dungeon, and full of terror, despair, and resentment, there seems to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8684",4705,"a radical difference, and of quite another kind, than what is produced","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8685",4705,"on a body by the change of its situation. As we conclude from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8686",4705,"distinction and separability of their ideas, that external objects","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8687",4705,"have a separate existence from each other; so when we make these ideas","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8688",4705,"themselves our objects, we must draw the same conclusion concerning","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8689",4705,"them, according to the precedent reasoning. At least it must be confest,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8690",4705,"that having idea of the substance of the soul, it is impossible for us","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8691",4705,"to tell how it can admit of such differences, and even contrarieties of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8692",4705,"perception without any fundamental change; and consequently can never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8693",4705,"tell in what sense perceptions are actions of that substance. The use,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8713",4705,"than the former, and more important than the latter, viz. concerning the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8714",4705,"cause of our perceptions. Matter and motion, it is commonly said in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8719",4705,"manner, you still find motion or a change of relation. It is absurd to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8720",4705,"imagine, that motion in a circle, for instance, should be nothing but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8721",4705,"merely motion in a circle; while motion in another direction, as in an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8722",4705,"ellipse, should also be a passion or moral reflection: That the shocking","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8727",4705,"any idea of thought or perception, it is concluded to be impossible,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8728",4705,"that thought can ever be caused by matter.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8729",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8730",4705,"Few have been able to withstand the seeming evidence of this argument;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8731",4705,"and yet nothing in the world is more easy than to refute it. We need","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8732",4705,"only reflect on what has been proved at large, that we are never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8733",4705,"sensible of any connexion betwixt causes and effects, and that it is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8734",4705,"only by our experience of their constant conjunction, we can arrive","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8735",4705,"at any knowledge of this relation. Now as all objects, which are not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8737",4705,"objects are contrary [Part III. Sect. 15.]; I have inferred from these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8738",4705,"principles, that to consider the matter A PRIORI, any thing may produce","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8740",4705,"or may not be the cause of any other, however great, or however little","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8741",4705,"the resemblance may be betwixt them. This evidently destroys the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8742",4705,"precedent reasoning concerning the cause of thought or perception. For","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8743",4705,"though there appear no manner of connexion betwixt motion or thought,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8744",4705,"the case is the same with all other causes and effects. Place one body","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8745",4705,"of a pound weight on one end of a lever, and another body of the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8747",4705,"of motion dependent on their distances from the center, more than of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8748",4705,"thought and perception. If you pretend, therefore, to prove a priori,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8749",4705,"that such a position of bodies can never cause thought; because turn it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8750",4705,"which way you will, it is nothing but a position of bodies; you must by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8751",4705,"the same course of reasoning conclude, that it can never produce motion;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8752",4705,"since there is no more apparent connexion in the one case than in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8753",4705,"other. But as this latter conclusion is contrary to evident experience,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8754",4705,"and as it is possible we may have a like experience in the operations of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8755",4705,"the mind, and may perceive a constant conjunction of thought and motion;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8756",4705,"you reason too hastily, when from the mere consideration of the ideas,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8758",4705,"a different position of parts give rise to a different passion or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8759",4705,"reflection. Nay it is not only possible we may have such an experience,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8760",4705,"but it is certain we have it; since every one may perceive, that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"8762",4705,"And should it be said, that this depends on the union of soul and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8763",4705,"body; I would answer, that we must separate the question concerning the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8764",4705,"substance of the mind from that concerning the cause of its thought; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8765",4705,"that confining ourselves to the latter question we find by the comparing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8766",4705,"their ideas, that thought and motion are different from each other,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8767",4705,"and by experience, that they are constantly united; which being all","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8768",4705,"the circumstances, that enter into the idea of cause and effect, when","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8769",4705,"applied to the operations of matter, we may certainly conclude, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8770",4705,"motion may be, and actually is, the cause of thought and perception.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8771",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8772",4705,"There seems only this dilemma left us in the present case; either to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8773",4705,"assert, that nothing can be the cause of another, but where the mind can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8774",4705,"perceive the connexion in its idea of the objects: Or to maintain, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8775",4705,"all objects, which we find constantly conjoined, are upon that account","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8776",4705,"to be regarded as causes and effects. If we choose the first part of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8777",4705,"dilemma, these are the consequences. First, We in reality affirm,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8778",4705,"that there is no such thing in the universe as a cause or productive","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8779",4705,"principle, not even the deity himself; since our idea of that supreme","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8780",4705,"Being is derived from particular impressions, none of which contain any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8781",4705,"efficacy, nor seem to have any connexion with any other existence. As to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8782",4705,"what may be said, that the connexion betwixt the idea of an infinitely","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8783",4705,"powerful being, and that of any effect, which he wills, is necessary and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8784",4705,"unavoidable; I answer, that we have no idea of a being endowed with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8785",4705,"any power, much less of one endowed with infinite power. But if we will","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8786",4705,"change expressions, we can only define power by connexion; and then in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8787",4705,"saying, that the idea, of an infinitely powerful being is connected with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8788",4705,"that of every effect, which he wills, we really do no more than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8789",4705,"assert, that a being, whose volition is connected with every effect,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8790",4705,"is connected with every effect: which is an identical proposition, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8791",4705,"gives us no insight into the nature of this power or connexion. But,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8792",4705,"secondly, supposing, that the deity were the great and efficacious","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8793",4705,"principle, which supplies the deficiency of all causes, this leads us","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8794",4705,"into the grossest impieties and absurdities. For upon the same account,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8795",4705,"that we have recourse to him in natural operations, and assert that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8796",4705,"matter cannot of itself communicate motion, or produce thought, viz.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8797",4705,"because there is no apparent connexion betwixt these objects; I say,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8798",4705,"upon the very same account, we must acknowledge that the deity is the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8799",4705,"author of all our volitions and perceptions; since they have no more","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8800",4705,"apparent connexion either with one another, or with the supposed but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8801",4705,"unknown substance of the soul. This agency of the supreme Being we know","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8802",4705,"to have been asserted by [As father Malebranche and other Cartesians.]","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8803",4705,"several philosophers with relation to all the actions of the mind,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8804",4705,"except volition, or rather an inconsiderable part of volition; though it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8805",4705,"is easy to perceive, that this exception is a mere pretext, to avoid the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8806",4705,"dangerous consequences of that doctrine. If nothing be active but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8807",4705,"what has an apparent power, thought is in no case any more active than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8808",4705,"matter; and if this inactivity must make us have recourse to a deity,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"8809",4705,"the supreme being is the real cause of all our actions, bad as well as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9034",4705,"greatness of the part, not absolutely, but by its proportion to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9035",4705,"whole. The addition or diminution of a mountain would not be sufficient","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9036",4705,"to produce a diversity in a planet: though the change of a very few","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9058",4705,"the changes are at last observed to become considerable, we make a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9059",4705,"scruple of ascribing identity to such different objects. There is,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9060",4705,"however, another artifice, by which we may induce the imagination to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9061",4705,"advance a step farther; and that is, by producing a reference of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9062",4705,"parts to each other, and a combination to some common end or purpose.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9069",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9070",4705,"But this is still more remarkable, when we add a sympathy of parts","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9072",4705,"reciprocal relation of cause and effect in all their actions and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9075",4705,"also a mutual dependence on, and connexion with each other. The effect","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9076",4705,"of so strong a relation is, that though every one must allow, that in a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9077",4705,"very few years both vegetables and animals endure a total change, yet we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9078",4705,"still attribute identity to them, while their form, size, and substance","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9079",4705,"are entirely altered. An oak, that grows from a small plant to a large","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9081",4705,"or figure of its parts the same. An infant becomes a man-, and is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9082",4705,"sometimes fat, sometimes lean, without any change in his identity.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9083",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9084",4705,"We may also consider the two following phaenomena, which are remarkable","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9085",4705,"in their kind. The first is, that though we commonly be able to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9086",4705,"distinguish pretty exactly betwixt numerical and specific identity, yet","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9087",4705,"it sometimes happens, that we confound them, and in our thinking and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9088",4705,"reasoning employ the one for the other. Thus a man, who bears a noise,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9089",4705,"that is frequently interrupted and renewed, says, it is still the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9090",4705,"noise; though it is evident the sounds have only a specific identity or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9091",4705,"resemblance, and there is nothing numerically the same, but the cause,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9092",4705,"which produced them. In like manner it may be said without breach of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9093",4705,"propriety of language, that such a church, which was formerly of brick,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9094",4705,"fell to ruin, and that the parish rebuilt the same church of free-stone,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9095",4705,"and according to modern architecture. Here neither the form nor","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9096",4705,"materials are the same, nor is there any thing common to the two","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9097",4705,"objects, but their relation to the inhabitants of the parish; and yet","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9098",4705,"this alone is sufficient to make us denominate them the same. But","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9099",4705,"we must observe, that in these cases the first object is in a manner","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9100",4705,"annihilated before the second comes into existence; by which means, we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9101",4705,"are never presented in any one point of time with the idea of difference","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9102",4705,"and multiplicity: and for that reason are less scrupulous in calling","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9103",4705,"them the same.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9104",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9105",4705,"Secondly, We may remark, that though in a succession of related objects,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9106",4705,"it be in a manner requisite, that the change of parts be not sudden nor","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9107",4705,"entire, in order to preserve the identity, yet where the objects are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9108",4705,"in their nature changeable and inconstant, we admit of a more sudden","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9109",4705,"transition, than would otherwise be consistent with that relation. Thus","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9110",4705,"as the nature of a river consists in the motion and change of parts;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9111",4705,"though in less than four and twenty hours these be totally altered; this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9112",4705,"hinders not the river from continuing the same during several ages. What","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9113",4705,"is natural and essential to any thing is, in a manner, expected; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9114",4705,"what is expected makes less impression, and appears of less moment, than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9115",4705,"what is unusual and extraordinary. A considerable change of the former","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9116",4705,"kind seems really less to the imagination, than the most trivial","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9117",4705,"alteration of the latter; and by breaking less the continuity of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9118",4705,"thought, has less influence in destroying the identity.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9119",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9120",4705,"We now proceed to explain the nature of personal identity, which has","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9121",4705,"become so great a question ill philosophy, especially of late years in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9122",4705,"England, where all the abstruser sciences are studyed with a peculiar","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9123",4705,"ardour and application. And here it is evident, the same method of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9124",4705,"reasoning must be continued which has so successfully explained the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9125",4705,"identity of plants, and animals, and ships, and houses, and of all","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9126",4705,"the compounded and changeable productions either of art or nature. The","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9127",4705,"identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a fictitious one,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9128",4705,"and of a like kind with that which we ascribe to vegetables and animal","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9129",4705,"bodies. It cannot, therefore, have a different origin, but must proceed","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9130",4705,"from a like operation of the imagination upon like objects.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9131",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9132",4705,"But lest this argument should not convince the reader; though in my","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9133",4705,"opinion perfectly decisive; let him weigh the following reasoning, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9134",4705,"is still closer and more immediate. It is evident, that the identity,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9135",4705,"which we attribute to the human mind, however perfect we may imagine it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9136",4705,"to be, is not able to run the several different perceptions into one,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9137",4705,"and make them lose their characters of distinction and difference, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9138",4705,"are essential to them. It is still true, that every distinct perception,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9139",4705,"which enters into the composition of the mind, is a distinct existence,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9140",4705,"and is different, and distinguishable, and separable from every other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9141",4705,"perception, either contemporary or successive. But, as, notwithstanding","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9142",4705,"this distinction and separability, we suppose the whole train of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9143",4705,"perceptions to be united by identity, a question naturally arises","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9144",4705,"concerning this relation of identity; whether it be something that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9145",4705,"really binds our several perceptions together, or only associates","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9146",4705,"their ideas in the imagination. That is, in other words, whether in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9147",4705,"pronouncing concerning the identity of a person, we observe some real","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9148",4705,"bond among his perceptions, or only feel one among the ideas we form of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9149",4705,"them. This question we might easily decide, if we would recollect what","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9150",4705,"has been already proud at large, that the understanding never observes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9151",4705,"any real connexion among objects, and that even the union of cause","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9152",4705,"and effect, when strictly examined, resolves itself into a customary","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9153",4705,"association of ideas. For from thence it evidently follows, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9154",4705,"identity is nothing really belonging to these different perceptions, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9155",4705,"uniting them together; but is merely a quality, which we attribute to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9156",4705,"them, because of the union of their ideas in the imagination, when we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9157",4705,"reflect upon them. Now the only qualities, which can give ideas an union","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9158",4705,"in the imagination, are these three relations above-mentioned. There","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9159",4705,"are the uniting principles in the ideal world, and without them","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9160",4705,"every distinct object is separable by the mind, and may be separately","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9161",4705,"considered, and appears not to have any more connexion with any other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9162",4705,"object, than if disjoined by the greatest difference and remoteness.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9163",4705,"It is, therefore, on some of these three relations of resemblance,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9165",4705,"of these relations consists in their producing an easy transition","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9170",4705,"The only question, therefore, which remains, is, by what relations this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9173",4705,"evident we must confine ourselves to resemblance and causation, and must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9174",4705,"drop contiguity, which has little or no influence in the present case.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9739",4705,"that as their ultimate and final object; but there is something farther","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9740",4705,"requisite in order to raise them: Something, which is peculiar to one of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9741",4705,"the passions, and produces not both in the very same degree. The first","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9742",4705,"idea, that is presented to the mind, is that of the cause or productive","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9743",4705,"principle. This excites the passion, connected with it; and that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9744",4705,"passion, when excited, turns our view to another idea, which is that of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9745",4705,"self. Here then is a passion placed betwixt two ideas, of which the one","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9746",4705,"produces it, and the other is produced by it. The first idea, therefore,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9749",4705,"To begin with the causes of pride and humility; we may observe, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9750",4705,"their most obvious and remarkable property is the vast variety of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9755",4705,"confined to the mind but extend their view to the body likewise. A man","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9757",4705,"in dancing, riding, and of his dexterity in any manual business","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9768",4705,"which he has himself built and contrived. Here the object of the passion","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9770",4705,"sub-divided into two parts, viz. the quality, which operates upon the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9771",4705,"passion, and the subject in which the quality inheres. The quality is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9772",4705,"the beauty, and the subject is the house, considered as his property or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"9773",4705,"contrivance. Both these parts are essential, nor is the distinction vain","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"9776",4705,"strongest relation alone, without beauty, or something else in its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10031",4705,"We have many instances of such a situation of affairs. The nerves of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10045",4705,"ASSISTED BY THE CO-OPERATION OF OTHER CAUSES? For it is observable, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10046",4705,"in this particular her conduct is different in the different passions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10047",4705,"and sensations. The palate must be excited by an external object, in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10048",4705,"order to produce any relish: But hunger arises internally, without the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10049",4705,"concurrence of any external object. But however the case may stand with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10050",4705,"other passions and impressions, it is certain, that pride requires the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10051",4705,"assistance of some foreign object, and that the organs, which produce","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10052",4705,"it, exert not themselves like the heart and arteries, by an original","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10053",4705,"internal movement. For first, daily experience convinces us, that pride","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10054",4705,"requires certain causes to excite it, and languishes when unsupported by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10055",4705,"some excellency in the character, in bodily accomplishments, in cloaths,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10056",4705,"equipage or fortune. SECONDLY, it is evident pride would be perpetual,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10057",4705,"if it arose immediately from nature; since the object is always the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10058",4705,"same, and there is no disposition of body peculiar to pride, as there","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10059",4705,"is to thirst and hunger. Thirdly, Humility is in the very same situation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10060",4705,"with pride; and therefore, either must, upon this supposition, be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10061",4705,"perpetual likewise, or must destroy the contrary passion from, the very","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10063",4705,"the whole, we may rest satisfyed with the foregoing conclusion, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10064",4705,"pride must have a cause, as well as an object, and that the one has no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10066",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10067",4705,"The difficulty, then, is only to discover this cause, and find what","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10069",4705,"action, which are naturally fitted to produce that emotion. Upon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10070",4705,"my consulting experience, in order to resolve this difficulty, I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10071",4705,"immediately find a hundred different causes, that produce pride; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10072",4705,"upon examining these causes, I suppose, what at first I perceive to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10073",4705,"probable, that all of them concur in two circumstances; which are, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10074",4705,"of themselves they produce an impression, allyed to the passion, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10075",4705,"are placed on a subject, allyed to the object of the passion. When I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10076",4705,"consider after this the nature of relation, and its effects both on the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10077",4705,"passions and ideas, I can no longer doubt, upon these suppositions, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10078",4705,"it is the very principle, which gives rise to pride, and bestows","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10079",4705,"motion on those organs, which being naturally disposed to produce that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10080",4705,"affection, require only a first impulse or beginning to their action.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10081",4705,"Any thing, that gives a pleasant sensation, and is related to self,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10082",4705,"excites the passion of pride, which is also agreeable, and has self for","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10083",4705,"its object.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10084",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10085",4705,"What I have said of pride is equally true of humility. The sensation of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10086",4705,"humility is uneasy, as that of pride is agreeable; for which reason the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10087",4705,"separate sensation, arising from the causes, must be reversed, while","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10088",4705,"the relation to self continues the same. Though pride and humility are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10089",4705,"directly contrary in their effects, and in their sensations, they have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10090",4705,"notwithstanding the same object; so that it is requisite only to change","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10091",4705,"the relation of impressions, without making any change upon that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10092",4705,"of ideas. Accordingly we find, that a beautiful house, belonging to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10093",4705,"ourselves, produces pride; and that the same house, still belonging to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10094",4705,"ourselves, produces humility, when by any accident its beauty is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10095",4705,"changed into deformity, and thereby the sensation of pleasure, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10096",4705,"corresponded to pride, is transformed into pain, which is related to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10097",4705,"humility. The double relation between the ideas and impressions subsists","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10098",4705,"in both cases, and produces an easy transition from the one emotion to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10099",4705,"the other.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10100",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10101",4705,"In a word, nature has bestowed a kind of attraction on certain","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10102",4705,"impressions and ideas, by which one of them, upon its appearance,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10103",4705,"naturally introduces its correlative. If these two attractions or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10104",4705,"associations of impressions and ideas concur on the same object, they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10105",4705,"mutually assist each other, and the transition of the affections and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10106",4705,"of the imagination is made with the greatest ease and facility. When","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10107",4705,"an idea produces an impression, related to an impression, which is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10108",4705,"connected with an idea, related to the first idea, these two impressions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10109",4705,"must be in a manner inseparable, nor will the one in any case be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10110",4705,"unattended with the other. It is after this manner, that the particular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10111",4705,"causes of pride and humility are determined. The quality, which operates","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10112",4705,"on the passion, produces separately an impression resembling it; the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10113",4705,"subject, to which the quality adheres, is related to self, the object of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10114",4705,"the passion: No wonder the whole cause, consisting of a quality and of a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10116",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10118",4705,"have already explained the belief attending the judgments, which we form","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10119",4705,"from causation. I have observed, that in all judgments of this kind,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10120",4705,"there is always a present impression and a related idea; and that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10142",4705,"derived from the very nature of the subject.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10143",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10144",4705,"I. Suppose an agreeable object to acquire a relation to self, the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10145",4705,"first passion, that appears on this occasion, is joy; and this passion","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10146",4705,"discovers itself upon a slighter relation than pride and vain-glory. We","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10147",4705,"may feel joy upon being present at a feast, where our senses are regard","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10148",4705,"with delicacies of every kind: But it is only the master of the feast,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10149",4705,"who, beside the same joy, has the additional passion of self-applause","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10150",4705,"and vanity. It is true, men sometimes boast of a great entertainment,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10151",4705,"at which they have only been present; and by so small a relation convert","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10152",4705,"their pleasure into pride: But however, this must in general be owned,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10153",4705,"that joy arises from a more inconsiderable relation than vanity, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10154",4705,"that many things, which are too foreign to produce pride, are yet able","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10155",4705,"to give us a delight and pleasure, The reason of the difference may be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10156",4705,"explained thus. A relation is requisite to joy, in order to approach","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10157",4705,"the object to us, and make it give us any satisfaction. But beside this,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10158",4705,"which is common to both passions, it is requisite to pride, in order","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10160",4705,"falsification into vanity. As it has a double task to perform, it must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10161",4705,"be endowed with double force and energy. To which we may add, that where","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10162",4705,"agreeable objects bear not a very close relation to ourselves, they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10163",4705,"commonly do to some other person; and this latter relation not only","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10164",4705,"excels, but even diminishes, and sometimes destroys the former, as we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10179",4705,"comparison than from their real and intrinsic merit; and where we cannot","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10187",4705,"influence on vanity. We are rejoiced for many goods, which, on account","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10193",4705,"The reason, why pride is so much more delicate in this particular than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10194",4705,"joy, I take to be, as follows. In order to excite pride, there are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10195",4705,"always two objects we must contemplate, viz. the cause or that object","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10196",4705,"which produces pleasure; and self, which is the real object of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10197",4705,"passion. But joy has only one object necessary to its production, viz.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10198",4705,"that which gives pleasure; and though it be requisite, that this bear","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10199",4705,"some relation to self, yet that is only requisite in order to render it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10200",4705,"agreeable; nor is self, properly speaking, the object of this passion.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10201",4705,"Since, therefore, pride has in a manner two objects, to which it directs","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10202",4705,"our view; it follows, that where neither of them have any singularity,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10203",4705,"the passion must be more weakened upon that account, than a passion,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10204",4705,"which has only one object. Upon comparing ourselves with others, as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10205",4705,"we are every moment apt to do, we find we are not in the least","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10206",4705,"distinguished; and upon comparing the object we possess, we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10207",4705,"discover still the same unlucky circumstance. By two comparisons so","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10209",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10210",4705,"III The third limitation is, that the pleasant or painful object be very","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10211",4705,"discernible and obvious, and that not only to ourselves, but to others","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10217",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10218",4705,"IV. The fourth limitation is derived from the inconstancy of the cause","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10219",4705,"of these passions, and from the short duration of its connexion with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10220",4705,"ourselves. What is casual and inconstant gives but little joy, and less","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10223",4705,"We foresee and anticipate its change by the imagination; which makes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10224",4705,"us little satisfyed with the thing: We compare it to ourselves, whose","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10225",4705,"existence is more durable; by which means its inconstancy appears still","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10226",4705,"greater. It seems ridiculous to infer an excellency in ourselves from an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10227",4705,"object, which is of so much shorter duration, and attends us during so","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10228",4705,"small a part of our existence. It will be easy to comprehend the reason,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10229",4705,"why this cause operates not with the same force in joy as in pride;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10230",4705,"since the idea of self is not so essential to the former passion as to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10232",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10233",4705,"V. I may add as a fifth limitation, or rather enlargement of this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10234",4705,"system, that general rules have a great influence upon pride and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10239",4705,"them of all enjoyment in their possessions. This may be accounted for","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10240",4705,"from the same principles, that explained the influence of general rules","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10241",4705,"on the understanding. Custom readily carries us beyond the just bounds","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10243",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10244",4705,"It may not be amiss to observe on this occasion, that the influence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10246",4705,"facilitate the effects of all the principles, which we shall explain","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10247",4705,"in the progress of this treatise. For it is evident, that if a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10255",4705,"principles, and have settled the just value of every thing; this must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10258",4705,"ought to observe in preferring one object to another. This remark may,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10259",4705,"perhaps, serve to obviate difficulties, that mayarise concerning some","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10260",4705,"causes, which I shall hereafter ascribe to particular passions,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10264",4705,"I shall close this subject with a reflection derived from these five","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10606",4705,"what manner are they related to ourselves? They are parts of the person","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10607",4705,"we value, and consequently connected with these trifles; which are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10622",4705,"the mind, and by what means they become so requisite to the production","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10629",4705,"reasoning, as well as from undoubted experience, we may conclude, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10636",4705,"impression produced by some other principle. The question is, whether","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10644",4705,"to another. If nature produced immediately the passion of pride or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10645",4705,"humility, it would be compleated in itself, and would require no farther","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10646",4705,"addition or encrease from any other affection. But supposing the first","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"10651",4705,"conceived, but I will venture to affirm it is the only manner, in which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10652",4705,"we can conceive this subject. An easy transition of ideas, which, of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10653",4705,"itself, causes no emotion, can never be necessary, or even useful to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10654",4705,"the passions, but by forwarding the transition betwixt some related","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10655",4705,"impressions. Not to mention, that the same object causes a greater","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10656",4705,"or smaller degree of pride, not only in proportion to the encrease or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10657",4705,"decrease of its qualities, but also to the distance or nearness of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10658",4705,"relation; which is a clear argument for the transition of affections","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"10659",4705,"along the relation of ideas; since every change in the relation produces","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11550",4705,"in these experiments, let us first suppose, that being placed in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11551",4705,"situation above-mentioned, viz, in company with some other person, there","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11552",4705,"is an object presented, that has no relation either of impressions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11555",4705,"causing of itself no emotion, or independent pain and pleasure: It is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11556",4705,"evident such an object will produce none of these four passions. Let","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11570",4705,"It is plain, that to consider the matter a priori, no emotion of any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11571",4705,"kind can reasonably be expected. For besides, that a relation of ideas","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11574",4705,"according as the object belongs to ourselves or others; which opposition","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11589",4705,"uncertain connexion with these passions. For besides, that this relation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11592",4705,"passions, which by their opposition destroy each other. But if we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11593",4705,"consider, on the other hand, that this transition from the sensation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11594",4705,"to the affection is not forwarded by any principle, that produces","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11595",4705,"a transition of ideas; but, on the contrary, that though the one","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11597",4705,"objects is supposed contrary to all the principles, that cause a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11598",4705,"transition of that kind; we may from thence infer, that nothing will","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11600",4705,"the passion merely by a relation of impressions. What our reason would","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11601",4705,"conclude from analogy, after balancing these arguments, would be, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11602",4705,"an object, which produces pleasure or uneasiness, but has no manner of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11603",4705,"connexion either with ourselves or others, may give such a turn to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11604",4705,"disposition, as that may naturally fall into pride or love, humility or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11610",4705,"Most fortunately all this reasoning is found to be exactly conformable","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11612",4705,"travelling with a companion through a country, to which we are both","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11618",4705,"passion on some other object, that bears either of us a closer relation,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11619",4705,"my emotions are rather to be considerd as the overflowings of an elevate","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11622",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11623",4705,"Fourth Experiment. Having found, that neither an object without any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11624",4705,"relation of ideas or impressions, nor an object, that has only one","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11625",4705,"relation, can ever cause pride or humility, love or hatred; reason alone","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11626",4705,"may convince us, without any farther experiment, that whatever has a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11627",4705,"double relation must necessarily excite these passions; since it is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11628",4705,"evident they must have some cause. But to leave as little room for doubt","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11629",4705,"as possible, let us renew our experiments, and see whether the event in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11630",4705,"this case answers our expectation. I choose an object, such as virtue,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11632",4705,"to self; and find, that from this disposition of affairs, there","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11633",4705,"immediately arises a passion. But what passion? That very one of pride,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11634",4705,"to which this object bears a double relation. Its idea is related","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11635",4705,"to that of self, the object of the passion: The sensation it causes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11636",4705,"resembles the sensation of the passion. That I may be sure I am not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11637",4705,"mistaken in this experiment, I remove first one relation; then another;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11638",4705,"and find, that each removal destroys the passion, and leaves the object","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11639",4705,"perfectly indifferent. But I am not content with this. I make a still","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11640",4705,"farther trial; and instead of removing the relation, I only change","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11641",4705,"it for one of a different kind. I suppose the virtue to belong to my","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11645",4705,"of love, where they are attracted by a double relation of impressions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11646",4705,"and ideas. By repeating the same experiment, in changing anew the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11647",4705,"relation of ideas, I bring the affections back to pride; and by a new","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11648",4705,"repetition I again place them at love or kindness. Being fully convinced","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11649",4705,"of the influence of this relation, I try the effects of the other; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11650",4705,"by changing virtue for vice, convert the pleasant impression, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11651",4705,"arises from the former, into the disagreeable one, which proceeds from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11685",4705,"Before we consider what they are in fact, let us determine what they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11686",4705,"ought to be, conformable to my hypothesis. It is plain, that, according","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11687",4705,"as the impression is either pleasant or uneasy, the passion of love or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11688",4705,"hatred must arise towards the person, who is thus connected to the cause","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11689",4705,"of the impression by these double relations, which I have all along","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11695",4705,"of my passion, the very same reasoning leads me to think the passion","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11696",4705,"will be carryed farther. The person has a relation of ideas to myself,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11698",4705,"being either agreeable or uneasy, has a relation of impressions to pride","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11699",4705,"or humility. It is evident, then, that one of these passions must arise","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11703",4705,"pleased to find upon trial that every thing answers exactly to my","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11777",4705,"Some may, perhaps, find a contradiction betwixt this phaenomenon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11790",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11791",4705,"Seventh Experiment. To put this whole reasoning to a farther trial, let","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11792",4705,"us make a new experiment; and as we have already seen the effects of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11793",4705,"related passions and ideas, let us here suppose an identity of passions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11794",4705,"along with a relation of ideas; and let us consider the effects of this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11795",4705,"new situation. It is evident a transition of the passions from the one","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11796",4705,"object to the other is here in all reason to be expected; since the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11797",4705,"relation of ideas is supposed still to continue, and identity of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11798",4705,"impressions must produce a stronger connexion, than the most perfect","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11799",4705,"resemblance, that can be imagined. If a double relation, therefore, of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11804",4705,"themselves towards all the contiguous objects, and comprehend the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11805",4705,"friends and relations of him we love or hate. Nothing is more natural","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11806",4705,"than to bear a kindness to one brother on account of our friendship for","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11807",4705,"another, without any farther examination of his character. A quarrel","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11808",4705,"with one person gives us a hatred for the whole family, though entirely","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11812",4705,"There is only one difficulty in this experiment, which it will be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11813",4705,"necessary to account for, before we proceed any farther. It is evident,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11814",4705,"that though all passions pass easily from one object to another related","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11815",4705,"to it, yet this transition is made with greater facility, where the more","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11816",4705,"considerable object is first presented, and the lesser follows it, than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11817",4705,"where this order is reversed, and the lesser takes the precedence. Thus","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11818",4705,"it is more natural for us to love the son upon account of the father,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11819",4705,"than the father upon account of the son; the servant for the master,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11820",4705,"than the master for the servant; the subject for the prince, than the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11821",4705,"prince for the subject. In like manner we more readily contract a hatred","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11822",4705,"against a whole family, where our first quarrel is with the head of it,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11823",4705,"than where we are displeased with a son, or servant, or some inferior","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11824",4705,"member. In short, our passions, like other objects, descend with greater","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11825",4705,"facility than they ascend.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11826",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11827",4705,"That we may comprehend, wherein consists the difficulty of explaining","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11828",4705,"this phaenomenon, we must consider, that the very same reason, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11829",4705,"determines the imagination to pass from remote to contiguous objects,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11830",4705,"with more facility than from contiguous to remote, causes it likewise","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11831",4705,"to change with more ease, the less for the greater, than the greater for","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11832",4705,"the less. Whatever has the greatest influence is most taken notice of;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11833",4705,"and whatever is most taken notice of, presents itself most readily to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11834",4705,"the imagination. We are more apt to over-look in any subject, what is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11835",4705,"trivial, than what appears of considerable moment; but especially if the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11836",4705,"latter takes the precedence, and first engages our attention. Thus if","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11838",4705,"naturally determined to form the idea of that planet; but if we first","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11839",4705,"reflect on the principal planet, it is more natural for us to overlook","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11840",4705,"its attendants. The mention of the provinces of any empire conveys our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11841",4705,"thought to the seat of the empire; but the fancy returns not with the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11842",4705,"same facility to the consideration of the provinces. The idea of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11843",4705,"servant makes us think of the master; that of the subject carries our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11844",4705,"view to the prince. But the same relation has not an equal influence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11845",4705,"in conveying us back again. And on this is founded that reproach of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11916",4705,"that of little, a passion directed to the former, produces always","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11917",4705,"a similar passion towards the latter; when the great and little are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11942",4705,"a violent. In this opposition the passion in the end prevails over the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11943",4705,"imagination; but it is commonly by complying with it, and by seeking","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11944",4705,"another quality, which may counter-ballance that principle, from whence","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11954",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11955",4705,"Eighth Experiment. I have observed that the transition from love or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11956",4705,"hatred to pride or humility, is more easy than from pride or humility to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11957",4705,"love or hatred; and that the difficulty, which the imagination finds in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11958",4705,"passing from contiguous to remote, is the cause why we scarce have any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11959",4705,"instance of the latter transition of the affections. I must, however,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11960",4705,"make one exception, viz, when the very cause of the pride and humility","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11961",4705,"is placed in some other person. For in that case the imagination is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11962",4705,"necessitated to consider the person, nor can it possibly confine its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11965",4705,"character: As on the other hand, nothing inspires us with a stronger","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11966",4705,"hatred, than his blame or contempt. Here it is evident, that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11967",4705,"original passion is pride or humility, whose object is self; and that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11968",4705,"this passion is transfused into love or hatred, whose object is some","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11972",4705,"relation betwixt ourselves and the person; but because that very person","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11973",4705,"is the real cause of our first passion, and of consequence is intimately","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11974",4705,"connected with it. It is his approbation that produces pride; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11975",4705,"disapprobation, humility. No wonder, then, the imagination returns back","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11976",4705,"again attended with the related passions of love and hatred. This is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11977",4705,"not a contradiction, but an exception to the rule; and an exception that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11978",4705,"arises from the same reason with the rule itself.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"11979",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11982",4705,"explained, we shall find that the same principle appears in all of them,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"11995",4705,"effect; which upon examination is found to proceed from some particular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"12351",4705,"objects they possess; such as houses, gardens, equipages; which, being","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"12357",4705,"concur in producing the present phaenomenon. The question is, to which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12358",4705,"of them we ought principally to ascribe it.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12359",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12360",4705,"It is certain, that the first principle, viz, the reflection on","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"12363",4705,"ugly, agreeable or disagreeable, without an emotion of pleasure or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12364",4705,"uneasiness; and though these sensations appear not much in our common","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12365",4705,"indolent way of thinking, it is easy, either in reading or conversation,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12366",4705,"to discover them. Men of wit always turn the discourse on subjects that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12367",4705,"are entertaining to the imagination; and poets never present any objects","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"12385",4705,"tendency to become strong and lively; such as our ideas of the passions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"12407",4705,"arise not from the idea of any beautiful or agreeable objects. It is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12408",4705,"true; money implies a kind of representation of such objects, by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"12431",4705,"of the agreeable objects, which they give him the power to produce,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"12432",4705,"would have but a feeble influence upon us. An avaritious man is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"12436",4705,"himself alone this power seems perfect and entire; and therefore we must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"13324",4705,"limited sympathy depends upon the force of the first sympathy; it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"13325",4705,"follows, that the passion of love or hatred depends upon the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"13335",4705,"Nor have we only our reason to trust to for this principle, but also","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"13336",4705,"experience. A certain degree of poverty produces contempt; but a degree","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"13337",4705,"beyond causes compassion and good-will. We may under-value a peasant","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"13352",4705,"disagreeable. The view of a city in ashes conveys benevolent sentiments;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"15970",4705,"this system. First, As moral good and evil belong only to the actions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15971",4705,"of the mind, and are derived from our situation with regard to external","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15972",4705,"objects, the relations, from which these moral distinctions arise, must","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15973",4705,"lie only betwixt internal actions, and external objects, and must not be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15974",4705,"applicable either to internal actions, compared among themselves, or to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15975",4705,"external objects, when placed in opposition to other external objects.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15976",4705,"For as morality is supposed to attend certain relations, if these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15977",4705,"relations coued belong to internal actions considered singly, it would","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15978",4705,"follow, that we might be guilty of crimes in ourselves, and independent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15979",4705,"of our situation, with respect to the universe: And in like manner, if","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15980",4705,"these moral relations coued be applied to external objects, it would","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15981",4705,"follow, that even inanimate beings would be susceptible of moral beauty","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15982",4705,"and deformity. Now it seems difficult to imagine, that any relation can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15983",4705,"be discovered betwixt our passions, volitions and actions, compared","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15984",4705,"to external objects, which relation might not belong either to these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15985",4705,"passions and volitions, or to these external objects, compared among","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15986",4705,"themselves. But it will be still more difficult to fulfil the second","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15987",4705,"condition, requisite to justify this system. According to the principles","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15988",4705,"of those who maintain an abstract rational difference betwixt moral good","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15989",4705,"and evil, and a natural fitness and unfitness of things, it is not only","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15990",4705,"supposed, that these relations, being eternal and immutable, are the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15991",4705,"same, when considered by every rational creature, but their effects are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15992",4705,"also supposed to be necessarily the same; and it is concluded they have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15993",4705,"no less, or rather a greater, influence in directing the will of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15994",4705,"deity, than in governing the rational and virtuous of our own species.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15995",4705,"These two particulars are evidently distinct. It is one thing to know","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15996",4705,"virtue, and another to conform the will to it. In order, therefore, to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15997",4705,"prove, that the measures of right and wrong are eternal laws, obligatory","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15998",4705,"on every rational mind, it is not sufficient to shew the relations upon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"15999",4705,"which they are founded: We must also point out the connexion betwixt","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16000",4705,"the relation and the will; and must prove that this connexion is so","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16001",4705,"necessary, that in every well-disposed mind, it must take place and have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16002",4705,"its influence; though the difference betwixt these minds be in other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16003",4705,"respects immense and infinite. Now besides what I have already proved,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16004",4705,"that even in human nature no relation can ever alone produce any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16005",4705,"action: besides this, I say, it has been shewn, in treating of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16006",4705,"understanding, that there is no connexion of cause and effect, such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16007",4705,"as this is supposed to be, which is discoverable otherwise than by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16008",4705,"experience, and of which we can pretend to have any security by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16009",4705,"simple consideration of the objects. All beings in the universe,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16010",4705,"considered in themselves, appear entirely loose and independent of each","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16011",4705,"other. It is only by experience we learn their influence and connexion;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16013",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16014",4705,"Thus it will be impossible to fulfil the first condition required to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16015",4705,"system of eternal measures of right and wrong; because it is impossible","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16016",4705,"to shew those relations, upon which such a distinction may be founded:","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16017",4705,"And it is as impossible to fulfil the second condition; because we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16018",4705,"cannot prove A PRIORI, that these relations, if they really existed and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16021",4705,"But to make these general reflections more dear and convincing, we may","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16022",4705,"illustrate them by some particular instances, wherein this character of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16023",4705,"moral good or evil is the most universally acknowledged. Of all crimes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16024",4705,"that human creatures are capable of committing, the most horrid and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16025",4705,"unnatural is ingratitude, especially when it is committed against","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16026",4705,"parents, and appears in the more flagrant instances of wounds and death.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16027",4705,"This is acknowledged by all mankind, philosophers as well as the people;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16028",4705,"the question only arises among philosophers, whether the guilt or moral","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16029",4705,"deformity of this action be discovered by demonstrative reasoning, or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16030",4705,"be felt by an internal sense, and by means of some sentiment, which the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16031",4705,"reflecting on such an action naturally occasions. This question will","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16032",4705,"soon be decided against the former opinion, if we can shew the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16033",4705,"relations in other objects, without the notion of any guilt or iniquity","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16034",4705,"attending them. Reason or science is nothing but the comparing of ideas,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16035",4705,"and the discovery of their relations; and if the same relations have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16036",4705,"different characters, it must evidently follow, that those characters","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16037",4705,"are not discovered merely by reason. To put the affair, therefore, to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16038",4705,"this trial, let us chuse any inanimate object, such as an oak or elm;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16039",4705,"and let us suppose, that by the dropping of its seed, it produces a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16040",4705,"sapling below it, which springing up by degrees, at last overtops and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16041",4705,"destroys the parent tree: I ask, if in this instance there be wanting","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16042",4705,"any relation, which is discoverable in parricide or ingratitude? Is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16043",4705,"not the one tree the cause of the other's existence; and the latter the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16044",4705,"cause of the destruction of the former, in the same manner as when a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16045",4705,"child murders his parent? It is not sufficient to reply, that a choice","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16046",4705,"or will is wanting. For in the case of parricide, a will does not give","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16047",4705,"rise to any DIFFERENT relations, but is only the cause from which the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16048",4705,"action is derived; and consequently produces the same relations, that in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16049",4705,"the oak or elm arise from some other principles. It is a will or choice,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16050",4705,"that determines a man to kill his parent; and they are the laws of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16051",4705,"matter and motion, that determine a sapling to destroy the oak, from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16052",4705,"which it sprung. Here then the same relations have different causes; but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16053",4705,"still the relations are the same: And as their discovery is not in both","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16054",4705,"cases attended with a notion of immorality, it follows, that that notion","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16060",4705,"turpitude and deformity? If it be answered, that this action is innocent","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16063",4705,"restrain him to his duty, the same action instantly becomes criminal to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16064",4705,"him; should this be said, I would reply, that this is evidently","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16065",4705,"arguing in a circle. For before reason can perceive this turpitude, the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16066",4705,"turpitude must exist; and consequently is independent of the decisions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16067",4705,"of our reason, and is their object more properly than their effect.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16068",4705,"According to this system, then, every animal, that has sense, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16069",4705,"appetite, and will; that is, every animal must be susceptible of all the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16070",4705,"same virtues and vices, for which we ascribe praise and blame to human","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16071",4705,"creatures. All the difference is, that our superior reason may serve to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16072",4705,"discover the vice or virtue, and by that means may augment the blame","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16073",4705,"or praise: But still this discovery supposes a separate being in these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16074",4705,"moral distinctions, and a being, which depends only on the will and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16075",4705,"appetite, and which, both in thought and reality, may be distinguished","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16076",4705,"from the reason. Animals are susceptible of the same relations, with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16077",4705,"respect to each other, as the human species, and therefore would also be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16078",4705,"susceptible of the same morality, if the essence of morality consisted","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16079",4705,"in these relations. Their want of a sufficient degree of reason may","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16080",4705,"hinder them from perceiving the duties and obligations of morality,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16083",4705,"them, and can never produce them. This argument deserves to be weighed,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16084",4705,"as being, in my opinion, entirely decisive.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16085",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16086",4705,"Nor does this reasoning only prove, that morality consists not in any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16087",4705,"relations, that are the objects of science; but if examined, will prove","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16088",4705,"with equal certainty, that it consists not in any matter of fact, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16089",4705,"can be discovered by the understanding. This is the second part of our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16092",4705,"that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16180",4705,"pleases after such a particular manner, we in effect feel that it is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16182",4705,"of beauty, and tastes, and sensations. Our approbation is implyed in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16187",4705,"actions of reasonable creatures, any relations, which are not found","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16188",4705,"in external objects; and therefore, if morality always attended these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16189",4705,"relations, it were possible for inanimate matter to become virtuous or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16190",4705,"vicious. Now it may, in like manner, be objected to the present system,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16191",4705,"that if virtue and vice be determined by pleasure and pain, these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16192",4705,"qualities must, in every case, arise from the sensations; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16193",4705,"consequently any object, whether animate or inanimate, rational or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16194",4705,"irrational, might become morally good or evil, provided it can excite","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16195",4705,"a satisfaction or uneasiness. But though this objection seems to be the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16196",4705,"very same, it has by no means the same force, in the one case as in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16197",4705,"the other. For, first, tis evident, that under the term pleasure, we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16198",4705,"comprehend sensations, which are very different from each other, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16199",4705,"which have only such a distant resemblance, as is requisite to make them","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16200",4705,"be expressed by the same abstract term. A good composition of music and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16201",4705,"a bottle of good wine equally produce pleasure; and what is more, their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16202",4705,"goodness is determined merely by the pleasure. But shall we say upon","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16203",4705,"that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the music of a good","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16204",4705,"flavour? In like manner an inanimate object, and the character or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16205",4705,"sentiments of any person may, both of them, give satisfaction; but as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16206",4705,"the satisfaction is different, this keeps our sentiments concerning them","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16207",4705,"from being confounded, and makes us ascribe virtue to the one, and not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16208",4705,"to the other. Nor is every sentiment of pleasure or pain, which arises","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16209",4705,"from characters and actions, of that peculiar kind, which makes us","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16210",4705,"praise or condemn. The good qualities of an enemy are hurtful to us; but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16211",4705,"may still command our esteem and respect. It is only when a character","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16212",4705,"is considered in general, without reference to our particular interest,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16213",4705,"that it causes such a feeling or sentiment, as denominates it morally","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16214",4705,"good or evil. It is true, those sentiments, from interest and morals,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16215",4705,"are apt to be confounded, and naturally run into one another. It seldom","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16216",4705,"happens, that we do not think an enemy vicious, and can distinguish","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16217",4705,"betwixt his opposition to our interest and real villainy or baseness.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16218",4705,"But this hinders not, but that the sentiments are, in themselves,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16219",4705,"distinct; and a man of temper and judgment may preserve himself from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16220",4705,"these illusions. In like manner, though it is certain a musical voice is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16221",4705,"nothing but one that naturally gives a particular kind of pleasure; yet","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16222",4705,"it is difficult for a man to be sensible, that the voice of an enemy is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16223",4705,"agreeable, or to allow it to be musical. But a person of a fine ear, who","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16224",4705,"has the command of himself, can separate these feelings, and give praise","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16225",4705,"to what deserves it.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16226",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16227",4705,"SECONDLY, We may call to remembrance the preceding system of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16228",4705,"passions, in order to remark a still more considerable difference","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16229",4705,"among our pains and pleasures. Pride and humility, love and hatred are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16230",4705,"excited, when there is any thing presented to us, that both bears a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16231",4705,"relation to the object of the passion, and produces a separate sensation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16232",4705,"related to the sensation of the passion. Now virtue and vice are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16233",4705,"attended with these circumstances. They must necessarily be placed","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16234",4705,"either in ourselves or others, and excite either pleasure or uneasiness;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16235",4705,"and therefore must give rise to one of these four passions; which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16236",4705,"clearly distinguishes them from the pleasure and pain arising from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16237",4705,"inanimate objects, that often bear no relation to us: And this is,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16238",4705,"perhaps, the most considerable effect that virtue and vice have upon the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16239",4705,"human mind.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16240",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16241",4705,"It may now be asked in general, concerning this pain or pleasure, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16242",4705,"distinguishes moral good and evil, FROM WHAT PRINCIPLES IS IT DERIVED,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16243",4705,"AND WHENCE DOES IT ARISE IN THE HUMAN MIND? To this I reply, first,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16244",4705,"that it is absurd to imagine, that in every particular instance, these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16245",4705,"sentiments are produced by an original quality and primary constitution.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16246",4705,"For as the number of our duties is, in a manner, infinite, it is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16247",4705,"impossible that our original instincts should extend to each of them,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16248",4705,"and from our very first infancy impress on the human mind all that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16249",4705,"multitude of precepts, which are contained in the compleatest system","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16250",4705,"of ethics. Such a method of proceeding is not conformable to the usual","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16251",4705,"maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles produce all","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16252",4705,"that variety we observe in the universe, and every thing is carryed on","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16253",4705,"in the easiest and most simple manner. It is necessary, therefore, to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16254",4705,"abridge these primary impulses, and find some more general principles,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16255",4705,"upon which all our notions of morals are founded.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16256",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16257",4705,"But in the second place, should it be asked, Whether we ought to search","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16258",4705,"for these principles in nature, or whether we must look for them in some","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16259",4705,"other origin? I would reply, that our answer to this question depends","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16260",4705,"upon the definition of the word, Nature, than which there is none more","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16261",4705,"ambiguous and equivocal. If nature be opposed to miracles, not only the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16262",4705,"distinction betwixt vice and virtue is natural, but also every event,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16263",4705,"which has ever happened in the world, EXCEPTING THOSE MIRACLES, ON WHICH","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16264",4705,"OUR RELIGION IS FOUNDED. In saying, then, that the sentiments of vice","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16265",4705,"and virtue are natural in this sense, we make no very extraordinary","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16266",4705,"discovery.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16267",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16268",4705,"But nature may also be opposed to rare and unusual; and in this sense","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16269",4705,"of the word, which is the common one, there may often arise disputes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16270",4705,"concerning what is natural or unnatural; and one may in general affirm,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16271",4705,"that we are not possessed of any very precise standard, by which these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16272",4705,"disputes can be decided. Frequent and rare depend upon the number of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16273",4705,"examples we have observed; and as this number may gradually encrease","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16274",4705,"or diminish, it will be impossible to fix any exact boundaries betwixt","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16275",4705,"them. We may only affirm on this head, that if ever there was any thing,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16276",4705,"which coued be called natural in this sense, the sentiments of morality","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16277",4705,"certainly may; since there never was any nation of the world, nor any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16278",4705,"single person in any nation, who was utterly deprived of them, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16279",4705,"who never, in any instance, shewed the least approbation or dislike of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16280",4705,"manners. These sentiments are so rooted in our constitution and temper,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16281",4705,"that without entirely confounding the human mind by disease or madness,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16283",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16284",4705,"But nature may also be opposed to artifice, as well as to what is rare","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16285",4705,"and unusual; and in this sense it may be disputed, whether the notions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16286",4705,"of virtue be natural or not. We readily forget, that the designs,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16288",4705,"operation as heat and cold, moist and dry: But taking them to be free","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16289",4705,"and entirely our own, it is usual for us to set them in opposition","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16290",4705,"to the other principles of nature should it, therefore, be demanded,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16291",4705,"whether the sense of virtue be natural or artificial, I am of opinion,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16292",4705,"that it is impossible for me at present to give any precise answer to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16955",4705,"along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16960",4705,"First, we may conclude from it, that a regard to public interest, or a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16961",4705,"strong extensive benevolence, is not our first and original motive for","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16968",4705,"connexions and relations of ideas, which are eternal, immutable, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16973",4705,"shew the change which this must produce in the relations and ideas. But","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16974",4705,"it is evident, that the only cause, why the extensive generosity of man,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16975",4705,"and the perfect abundance of every thing, would destroy the very idea of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16976",4705,"justice, is because they render it useless; and that, on the other hand,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16990",4705,"since any considerable alteration of temper and circumstances destroys","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"16992",4705,"effect only by changing our own and the publick interest; it follows,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16993",4705,"that the first establishment of the rules of justice depends on these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"16994",4705,"different interests. But if men pursued the publick interest naturally,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17002",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17003",4705,"To make this more evident, consider, that though the rules of justice","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17005",4705,"somewhat singular, and is different from what may be observed on other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17007",4705,"interest; and were it to stand alone, without being followed by other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17008",4705,"acts, may, in itself, be very prejudicial to society. When a man of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17010",4705,"or a seditious bigot, he has acted justly and laudably, but the public","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17011",4705,"is a real sufferer. Nor is every single act of justice, considered","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17020",4705,"to separate the good from the ill. Property must be stable, and must be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17027",4705,"is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17028",4705,"supposed in society. When therefore men have had experience enough","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17032",4705,"whole, and to every part; it is not long before justice and property","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17033",4705,"take place. Every member of society is sen sible of this interest: Every","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17034",4705,"one expresses this sense to his fellows, along with the resolution he","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17039",4705,"convention or agreement; that is, by a sense of interest, supposed to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17256",4705,"     because they are conjoined by causation, and are already","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17259",4705,"     any union, it will easily be imagined, that if there be any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17260",4705,"     relations, which depend on the mind, it will readily conjoin","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17271",4705,"     choice of the particular objects, It naturally turns its eye","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17272",4705,"     to such as are related together. They are already united in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17275",4705,"     their conjunction, it would require a very powerful reason","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17276",4705,"     to make us over-look this natural affinity. This we shall","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17407",4705,"     report, they dispatched at once two messengers, one from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17408",4705,"     each colony; who finding on their approach, that their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17556",4705,"     proprietor of the small one; since the transition is in that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17557",4705,"     case very easy from the small object to the great one, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17559",4705,"     fact the case is always found to be otherwise, The empire of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17563",4705,"     naturally imply any title to Great Britain. In short, a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17564",4705,"     small object naturally follows a great one as its accession;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17565",4705,"     but a great one Is never supposed to belong to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17739",4705,"     the cup or ship. Sabinus maintained the affirmative, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"17740",4705,"     asserted that the substance or matter is the foundation of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"17748",4705,"     that it is utterly impossible to trace it in all its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18127",4705,"already, that there is no such act of the mind, and consequently that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18128",4705,"promises impose no natural obligation.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18130",4705,"To confirm this, we may subjoin some other reflections concerning","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18132",4705,"obligation. It is evident, that the will alone is never supposed to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18142",4705,"himself, would not certainly be bound by it. Nay, though he knows its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18144",4705,"evidently he has no serious intention of binding himself, he would not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18241",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18242",4705,"I shall begin with observing, that this quality, which we shall call","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18243",4705,"property, is like many of the imaginary qualities of the peripatetic","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18244",4705,"philosophy, and vanishes upon a more accurate inspection into the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18245",4705,"subject, when considered a-part from our moral sentiments. It is evident","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18246",4705,"property does not consist in any of the sensible qualities of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18247",4705,"object. For these may continue invariably the same, while the property","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18248",4705,"changes. Property, therefore, must consist in some relation of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18249",4705,"object. But it is not in its relation with regard to other external","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18250",4705,"and inanimate objects. For these may also continue invariably the same,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18251",4705,"while the property changes. This quality, therefore, consists in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18252",4705,"relations of objects to intelligent and rational beings. But it is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18253",4705,"not the external and corporeal relation, which forms the essence of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18254",4705,"property. For that relation may be the same betwixt inanimate objects,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18255",4705,"or with regard to brute creatures; though in those cases it forms no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18256",4705,"property. It is, therefore, in some internal relation, that the property","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18257",4705,"consists; that is, in some influence, which the external relations of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18258",4705,"the object have on the mind and actions. Thus the external relation,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18259",4705,"which we call occupation or first possession, is not of itself imagined","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18260",4705,"to be the property of the object, but only to cause its property. Now it","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18261",4705,"is evident, this external relation causes nothing in external objects,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18262",4705,"and has only an influence on the mind, by giving us a sense of duty in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18263",4705,"abstaining from that object, and in restoring it to the first possessor.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18273",4705,"or uneasiness. Thus the restoring a man's goods to him is considered as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18274",4705,"virtuous, not because nature has annexed a certain sentiment of pleasure","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18275",4705,"to such a conduct, with regard to the property of others, but because","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18276",4705,"she has annexed that sentiment to such a conduct, with regard to those","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18277",4705,"external objects, of which others have had the first or long possession,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18278",4705,"or which they have received by the consent of those, who have had first","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18280",4705,"not, naturally, nor antecedent to human conventions, any such thing as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18281",4705,"property. Now, though it seems sufficiently evident, in this dry and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18282",4705,"accurate consideration of the present subject, that nature has annexed","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18283",4705,"no pleasure or sentiment of approbation to such a conduct; yet that I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18284",4705,"may leave as little room for doubt as possible, I shall subjoin a few","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18285",4705,"more arguments to confirm my opinion.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18286",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18287",4705,"First, If nature had given us a pleasure of this kind, it would have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18288",4705,"been as evident and discernible as on every other occasion; nor should","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18289",4705,"we have found any difficulty to perceive, that the consideration of such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18291",4705,"approbation. We should not have been obliged to have recourse to notions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18292",4705,"of property in the definition of justice, and at the same time make use","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18293",4705,"of the notions of justice in the definition of property. This deceitful","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18294",4705,"method of reasoning is a plain proof, that there are contained in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18295",4705,"subject some obscurities and difficulties, which we are not able to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18296",4705,"surmount, and which we desire to evade by this artifice.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18297",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18298",4705,"Secondly, Those rules, by which properties, rights, and obligations","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18299",4705,"are determined, have in them no marks of a natural origin but many of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18300",4705,"artifice and contrivance. They are too numerous to have proceeded from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18301",4705,"nature: They are changeable by human laws: And have all of them a direct","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18302",4705,"and evident tendency to public good, and the support, of civil society.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18303",4705,"This last circumstance is remarkable upon two accounts. First, because,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18304",4705,"though the cause of the establishment of these laws had been a regard","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18305",4705,"for the public good, as much as the public good is their natural","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18306",4705,"tendency, they would still have been artificial, as being purposely","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18307",4705,"contrived and directed to a certain end. Secondly, because, if men had","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18308",4705,"been endowed with such a strong regard for public good, they would never","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18309",4705,"have restrained themselves by these rules; so that the laws of justice","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18310",4705,"arise from natural principles in a manner still more oblique and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18311",4705,"artificial. It is self-love which is their real origin; and as the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18312",4705,"self-love of one person is naturally contrary to that of another, these","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18313",4705,"several interested passions are obliged to adjust themselves after such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18314",4705,"a manner as to concur in some system of conduct and behaviour. This","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18315",4705,"system, therefore, comprehending the interest of each individual, is of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18316",4705,"course advantageous to the public; though it be not intended for that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18317",4705,"purpose by die inventors.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18318",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18319",4705,"(2) In the second place we may observe, that all kinds of vice and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18320",4705,"virtue run insensibly into each other, and may approach by such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18321",4705,"imperceptible degrees as will make it very difficult, if not absolutely","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18322",4705,"impossible, to determine when the one ends, and the other begins; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18323",4705,"from this observation we may derive a new argument for the foregoing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18324",4705,"principle. For whatever may be the case, with regard to all kinds","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18325",4705,"of vice and virtue, it is certain, that rights, and obligations, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18326",4705,"property, admit of no such insensible gradation, but that a man either","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18327",4705,"has a full and perfect property, or none at all; and is either entirely","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18328",4705,"obliged to perform any action, or lies under no manner of obligation.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18329",4705,"However civil laws may talk of a perfect dominion, and of an imperfect,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18330",4705,"it is easy to observe, that this arises from a fiction, which has no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18331",4705,"foundation in reason, and can never enter into our notions of natural","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18332",4705,"justice and equity. A man that hires a horse, though but for a day, has","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18333",4705,"as full a right to make use of it for that time, as he whom we call its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18334",4705,"proprietor has to make use of it any other day; and it was evident, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18335",4705,"however the use may be bounded in time or degree, the right itself is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18336",4705,"not susceptible of any such gradation, but is absolute and entire, so","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18337",4705,"far as it extends. Accordingly we may observe, that this right both","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18338",4705,"arises and perishes in an instant; and that a man entirely acquires the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18339",4705,"property of any object by occupation, or the consent of the proprietor;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18340",4705,"and loses it by his own consent; without any of that insensible","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18341",4705,"gradation, which is remarkable in other qualities and relations, Since,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18342",4705,"therefore, this is die case with regard to property, and rights, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18343",4705,"obligations, I ask, how it stands with regard to justice and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18344",4705,"injustice? After whatever manner you answer this question, you run into","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18345",4705,"inextricable difficulties. If you reply, that justice and injustice","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18346",4705,"admit of degree, and run insensibly into each other, you expressly","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18347",4705,"contradict the foregoing position, that obligation and property are not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18348",4705,"susceptible of such a gradation. These depend entirely upon justice and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18349",4705,"injustice, and follow them in all their variations. Where the justice is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18350",4705,"entire, the property is also entire: Where the justice is imperfect, the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18351",4705,"property must also be imperfect And vice versa, if the property admit of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18352",4705,"no such variations, they must also be incompatible with justice. If you","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18353",4705,"assent, therefore, to this last proposition, and assert, that justice","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18801",4705,"their interest to perform, independent of these promises; as when they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18804",4705,"the performance of promises, besides its moral obligation, is general,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18805",4705,"avowed, and of the last consequence in life. Other interests may be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18809",4705,"are often required for fuller satisfaction and security. But supposing","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18810",4705,"those other interests to be as general and avowed as the interest in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18811",4705,"performance of a promise, they will be regarded as on the same footing,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18812",4705,"and men will begin to repose the same confidence in them. Now this is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18813",4705,"exactly the case with regard to our civil duties, or obedience to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18817",4705,"the other. Our civil duties, therefore, must soon detach themselves from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18818",4705,"our promises, and acquire a separate force and influence. The interest","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18819",4705,"in both is of the very same kind: It is general, avowed, and prevails in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18820",4705,"all times and places. There is, then, no pretext of reason for founding","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18821",4705,"the one upon the other; while each of them has a foundation peculiar","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18822",4705,"to itself. We might as well resolve the obligation to abstain from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18823",4705,"possessions of others, into the obligation of a promise, as that of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18824",4705,"allegiance. The interests are not more distinct in the one case than the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18825",4705,"other. A regard to property is not more necessary to natural society,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18826",4705,"than obedience is to civil society or government; nor is the former","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18827",4705,"society more necessary to the being of mankind, than the latter to their","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18828",4705,"well-being and happiness. In short, if the performance of promises be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18829",4705,"advantageous, so is obedience to government: If the former interest be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18830",4705,"general, so is the latter: If the one interest be obvious and avowed, so","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18831",4705,"is the other. And as these two rules are founded on like obligations of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18832",4705,"interest, each of them must have a peculiar authority, independent of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18834",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18835",4705,"But it is not only the natural obligations of interest, which are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18839",4705,"close connexion there is betwixt the natural and moral obligations, we","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18840",4705,"shall find this conclusion to be entirely unavoidable. Our interest","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18843",4705,"making us over-look the remote interest, which we have in the preserving","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18844",4705,"of peace and order in society. But though a present interest may thus","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18845",4705,"blind us with regard to our own actions, it takes not place with regard","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18846",4705,"to those of others; nor hinders them from appearing in their true","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18847",4705,"colours, as highly prejudicial to public interest, and to our own in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18848",4705,"particular. This naturally gives us an uneasiness, in considering such","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18849",4705,"seditious and disloyal actions, and makes us attach to them the idea of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18850",4705,"vice and moral deformity. It is the same principle, which causes us to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18851",4705,"disapprove of all kinds of private injustice, and in particular of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18852",4705,"breach of promises. We blame all treachery and breach of faith; because","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18853",4705,"we consider, that the freedom and extent of human commerce depend","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18854",4705,"entirely on a fidelity with regard to promises. We blame all disloyalty","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"18857",4705,"the performance of promises, is impossible, without submission to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18858",4705,"government. As there are here two interests entirely distinct from each","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18859",4705,"other, they must give rise to two moral obligations, equally separate","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18860",4705,"and independent. Though there was no such thing as a promise in the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"18861",4705,"world, government would still be necessary in all large and civilized","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19045",4705,"assert to be entirely the present case. When men submit to the authority","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19129",4705,"lawful magistrates? In order to answer this question, let us recollect","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19130",4705,"what we have already established concerning the origin of government and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19136",4705,"transgress the laws of society. Government, therefore, arises from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19137",4705,"same voluntary conversation of men; and it is evident, that the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19138",4705,"convention, which establishes government, will also determine the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19139",4705,"persons who are to govern, and will remove all doubt and ambiguity in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19140",4705,"this particular. And the voluntary consent of men must here have the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19141",4705,"greater efficacy, that the authority of the magistrate does at first","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19142",4705,"stand upon the foundation of a promise of the subjects, by which they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19143",4705,"bind themselves to obedience; as in every other contract or engagement.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19144",4705,"The same promise, then, which binds them to obedience, ties them down to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19149",4705,"submission, has produced a separate sentiment of morality, the case","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19151",4705,"particular magistrate since it is no longer considered as the foundation","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19152",4705,"of government. We naturally suppose ourselves born to submission; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19153",4705,"imagine, that such particular persons have a right to command, as we on","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19154",4705,"our part are bound to obey. These notions of right and obligation are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19157",4705,"displeased with any instance of it in others. But here it is remarkable,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19158",4705,"that in this new state of affairs, the original sanction of government,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19160",4705,"to obey, as the original sanction did at first, when affairs were on","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19161",4705,"the footing of a promise. A promise fixes and determines the persons,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19162",4705,"without any uncertainty: But it is evident, that if men were to regulate","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19163",4705,"their conduct in this particular, by the view of a peculiar interest,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19164",4705,"either public or private, they would involve themselves in endless","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19165",4705,"confusion, and would render all government, in a great measure,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19168",4705,"the source of as great dissentions, by reason of the different opinions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19169",4705,"of particular persons concerning it. The same interest, therefore,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19173",4705,"the utmost perfection in either. The case is here the same as in that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19174",4705,"law of nature concerning the stability of possession. It is highly","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19175",4705,"advantageous, and even absolutely necessary to society, that possession","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19176",4705,"should be stable; and this leads us to the establishment of such a rule:","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19177",4705,"But we find, that were we to follow the same advantage, in assigning","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19179",4705,"our end, and perpetuate the confusion, which that rule is intended to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19180",4705,"prevent. We must, therefore, proceed by general rules, and regulate","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19184",4705,"frivolousness of those interests, by which it is determined. The impulse","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19187",4705,"any thing to it, or diminishing from it. It is the same case with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19188",4705,"government. Nothing is more advantageous to society than such an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19189",4705,"invention; and this interest is sufficient to make us embrace it with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19199",4705,"is certain, that if we remount to the first origin of every nation,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19206",4705,"upon us than custom, or turns our imagination more strongly to any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19985",4705,"are several circumstances, which render this hypothesis much more","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19986",4705,"probable with regard to the natural than the artificial virtues. It is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19987",4705,"certain that the imagination is more affected by what is particular,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19989",4705,"with difficulty, where their objects are, in any degree, loose and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19990",4705,"undetermined: Now every particular act of justice is not beneficial to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19991",4705,"society, but the whole scheme or system: And it may not, perhaps, be any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19992",4705,"individual person for whom we are concerned, who receives benefit from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19993",4705,"justice, but the whole society alike. On the contrary, every particular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19994",4705,"act of generosity, or relief of the industrious and indigent, is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"19995",4705,"beneficial; and is beneficial to a particular person, who is not","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"19999",4705,"that the approbation of the former arises from their tendencies, we may","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20000",4705,"ascribe, with better reason, the same cause to the approbation of the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"20007",4705,"Before I proceed farther, I must observe two remarkable circumstances in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20008",4705,"this affair, which may seem objections to the present system. The first","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20009",4705,"may be thus explained. When any quality, or character, has a tendency to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20010",4705,"the good of mankind, we are pleased with it, and approve of it; because","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20011",4705,"it presents the lively idea of pleasure; which idea affects us by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20012",4705,"sympathy, and is itself a kind of pleasure. But as this sympathy is very","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20013",4705,"variable, it may be thought that our sentiments of morals must admit of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20014",4705,"all the same variations. We sympathize more with persons contiguous to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20015",4705,"us, than with persons remote from us: With our acquaintance, than","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20016",4705,"with strangers: With our countrymen, than with foreigners. But","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20017",4705,"notwithstanding this variation of our sympathy, we give the same","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20018",4705,"approbation to the same moral qualities in China as in England. They","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20019",4705,"appear equally virtuous, and recommend themselves equally to the esteem","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20020",4705,"of a judicious spectator. The sympathy varies without a variation in our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20021",4705,"esteem. Our esteem, therefore, proceeds not from sympathy.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20022",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20023",4705,"To this I answer: The approbation of moral qualities most certainly","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20024",4705,"is not derived from reason, or any comparison of ideas; but proceeds","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20025",4705,"entirely from a moral taste, and from certain sentiments of pleasure","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20026",4705,"or disgust, which arise upon the contemplation and view of particular","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20027",4705,"qualities or characters. Now it is evident, that those sentiments,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20028",4705,"whence-ever they are derived, must vary according to the distance or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20029",4705,"contiguity of the objects; nor can I feel the same lively pleasure from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"20032",4705,"I do not say, that I esteem the one more than the other: And therefore,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20033",4705,"if the variation of the sentiment, without a variation of the esteem,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20034",4705,"be an objection, it must have equal force against every other system, as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20035",4705,"against that of sympathy. But to consider the matter a-right, it has no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20036",4705,"force at all; and it is the easiest matter in the world to account","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20037",4705,"for it. Our situation, with regard both to persons and things, is in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"20044",4705,"continual contradictions, and arrive at a more stable judgment of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"20915",4705,"involuntary, and have therefore no merit attending them, as having no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20916",4705,"dependance on liberty and free-will. But to this I answer, first, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20917",4705,"many of those qualities, which all moralists, especially the antients,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20918",4705,"comprehend under the title of moral virtues, are equally involuntary and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20919",4705,"necessary, with the qualities of the judgment and imagination. Of this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20920",4705,"nature are constancy, fortitude, magnanimity; and, in short, all the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20921",4705,"qualities which form the great man. I might say the same, in some","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20922",4705,"degree, of the others; it being almost impossible for the mind to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20923",4705,"change its character in any considerable article, or cure itself of a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20924",4705,"passionate or splenetic temper, when they are natural to it. The greater","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20925",4705,"degree there is of these blameable qualities, the more vicious they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20926",4705,"become, and yet they are the less voluntary. Secondly, I would have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20927",4705,"anyone give me a reason, why virtue and vice may not be involuntary, as","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20928",4705,"well as beauty and deformity. These moral distinctions arise from the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20929",4705,"natural distinctions of pain and pleasure; and when we receive those","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20930",4705,"feelings from the general consideration of any quality or character,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20931",4705,"we denominate it vicious or virtuous. Now I believe no one will assert,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20932",4705,"that a quality can never produce pleasure or pain to the person who","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20933",4705,"considers it, unless it be perfectly voluntary in the person who","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20934",4705,"possesses it. Thirdly, As to free-will, we have shewn that it has no","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20935",4705,"place with regard to the actions, no more than the qualities of men. It","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20936",4705,"is not a just consequence, that what is voluntary is free. Our actions","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20937",4705,"are more voluntary than our judgments; but we have not more liberty in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20938",4705,"the one than in the other.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20939",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"20941",4705,"sufficient to justify the distinction betwixt natural abilities and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20942",4705,"moral virtues, yet the former distinction will afford us a plausible","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20943",4705,"reason, why moralists have invented the latter. Men have observed, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20944",4705,"though natural abilities and moral qualities be in the main on the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20945",4705,"same footing, there is, however, this difference betwixt them, that the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"20947",4705,"or at least, the actions, that proceed from them, may be changed by the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20948",4705,"motives of rewards and punishments, praise and blame. Hence legislators,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20949",4705,"and divines, and moralists, have principally applied themselves to the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20950",4705,"regulating these voluntary actions, and have endeavoured to produce","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20951",4705,"additional motives, for being virtuous in that particular. They","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20952",4705,"knew, that to punish a man for folly, or exhort him to be prudent and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20953",4705,"sagacious, would have but little effect; though the same punishments","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"20954",4705,"and exhortations, with regard to justice and injustice, might have a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21168",4705,"pleasure, which a rich man gives us, by the view of the beautiful","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21235",4705,"observe, that all the circumstances requisite for its operation are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21236",4705,"found in most of the virtues; which have, for the most part, a tendency","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21237",4705,"to the good of society, or to that of the person possessed of them. If","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21238",4705,"we compare all these circumstances, we shall not doubt, that sympathy is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21239",4705,"the chief source of moral distinctions; especially when we reflect, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21240",4705,"no objection can be raised against this hypothesis in one case, which","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21250",4705,"Most people will readily allow, that the useful qualities of the mind","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21251",4705,"are virtuous, because of their utility. This way of thinking is so","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21252",4705,"natural, and occurs on so many occasions, that few will make any scruple","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21253",4705,"of admitting it. Now this being once admitted, the force of sympathy","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21254",4705,"must necessarily be acknowledged. Virtue is considered as means to an","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21345",4705,"ingenuity of his temper. I have not yet been so fortunate as to discover","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21346",4705,"any very considerable mistakes in the reasonings delivered in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21347",4705,"the preceding volumes, except on one article: But I have found by","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21348",4705,"experience, that some of my expressions have not been so well chosen,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21349",4705,"as to guard against all mistakes in the readers; and it is chiefly to","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21350",4705,"remedy this defect, I have subjoined the following appendix.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21351",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21352",4705,"We can never be induced to believe any matter of fact, except where its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21353",4705,"cause, or its effect, is present to us; but what the nature is of that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21354",4705,"belief, which arises from the relation of cause and effect, few have","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21355",4705,"had the curiosity to ask themselves. In my opinion, this dilemma is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21356",4705,"inevitable. Either the belief is some new idea, such as that of reality","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21357",4705,"or existence, which we join to the simple conception of an object, or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21358",4705,"it is merely a peculiar feeling or sentiment. That it is not a new","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21359",4705,"idea, annexed to the simple conception, may be evinced from these two","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21360",4705,"arguments. First, We have no abstract idea of existence, distinguishable","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21361",4705,"and separable from the idea of particular objects. It is impossible,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21362",4705,"therefore, that this idea of existence can be annexed to the idea of any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21363",4705,"object, or form the difference betwixt a simple conception and belief.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21364",4705,"Secondly, The mind has the command over all its ideas, and can separate,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21365",4705,"unite, mix, and vary them, as it pleases; so that if belief consisted","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21366",4705,"merely in a new idea, annexed to the conception, it would be in a man's","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21367",4705,"power to believe what he pleased. We may, therefore, conclude, that","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21368",4705,"belief consists merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21369",4705,"that depends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21370",4705,"causes and principles, of which we are not masters. When we are","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21371",4705,"convinced of any matter of fact, we do nothing but conceive it, along","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21372",4705,"with a certain feeling, different from what attends the mere reveries","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21373",4705,"of the imagination. And when we express our incredulity concerning any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21374",4705,"fact, we mean, that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21375",4705,"Did not the belief consist in a sentiment different from our mere","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21376",4705,"conception, whatever objects were presented by the wildest imagination,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21377",4705,"would be on an equal footing with the most established truths founded on","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21378",4705,"history and experience. There is nothing but the feeling, or sentiment,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21382",4705,"nothing but a peculiar feeling, different from the simple conception,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21383",4705,"the next question, that naturally occurs, is, what is the nature of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21384",4705,"this feeling, or sentiment, and whether it be analogous to any other","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21385",4705,"sentiment of the human mind? This question is important. For if it be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21386",4705,"not analogous to any other sentiment, we must despair of explaining its","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21387",4705,"causes, and must consider it as an original principle of the human mind.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21388",4705,"If it be analogous, we may hope to explain its causes from analogy,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21389",4705,"and trace it up to more general principles. Now that there is a greater","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21390",4705,"firmness and solidity in the conceptions, which are the objects of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21391",4705,"conviction and assurance, than in the loose and indolent reveries of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21392",4705,"a castle-builder, every one will readily own. They strike upon us with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21393",4705,"more force; they are more present to us; the mind has a firmer hold of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21394",4705,"them, and is more actuated and moved by them. It acquiesces in them;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21395",4705,"and, in a manner, fixes and reposes itself on them. In short, they","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21396",4705,"approach nearer to the impressions, which are immediately present to us;","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21397",4705,"and are therefore analogous to many other operations of the mind.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21398",4705,"","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21399",4705,"There is not, in my opinion, any possibility of evading this conclusion,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21401",4705,"some impression or feeling, distinguishable from the conception. It does","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21402",4705,"not modify the conception, and render it more present and intense: It","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21403",4705,"is only annexed to it, after the same manner that will and desire","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21404",4705,"are annexed to particular conceptions of good and pleasure. But the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21405",4705,"following considerations will, I hope, be sufficient to remove this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21406",4705,"hypothesis. First, It is directly contrary to experience, and our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21407",4705,"immediate consciousness. All men have ever allowed reasoning to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21408",4705,"merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas; and however those ideas","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21409",4705,"may be varied to the feeling, there is nothing ever enters into our","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21410",4705,"conclusions but ideas, or our fainter conceptions. For instance; I hear","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21411",4705,"at present a person's voice, whom I am acquainted with; and this sound","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21412",4705,"comes from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21413",4705,"conveys my thoughts to the person, along with all the surrounding","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21414",4705,"objects. I paint them out to myself as existent at present, with the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21415",4705,"same qualities and relations, that I formerly knew them possessed of.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21416",4705,"These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than the ideas of an inchanted","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21417",4705,"castle. They are different to the feeling; but there is no distinct or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21418",4705,"separate impression attending them. It is the same case when I recollect","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21419",4705,"the several incidents of a journey, or the events of any history. Every","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21420",4705,"particular fact is there the object of belief. Its idea is modified","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21421",4705,"differently from the loose reveries of a castle-builder: But no distinct","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21422",4705,"impression attends every distinct idea, or conception of matter of fact.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21423",4705,"This is the subject of plain experience. If ever this experience can","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21424",4705,"be disputed on any occasion, it is when the mind has been agitated with","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21425",4705,"doubts and difficulties; and afterwards, upon taking the object in a new","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21426",4705,"point of view, or being presented with a new argument, fixes and reposes","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21427",4705,"itself in one settled conclusion and belief. In this case there is a","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21428",4705,"feeling distinct and separate from the conception. The passage from","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21429",4705,"doubt and agitation to tranquility and repose, conveys a satisfaction","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21430",4705,"and pleasure to the mind. But take any other case. Suppose I see the","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21431",4705,"legs and thighs of a person in motion, while some interposed object","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21432",4705,"conceals the rest of his body. Here it is certain, the imagination","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21433",4705,"spreads out the whole figure. I give him a head and shoulders, and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21434",4705,"breast and neck. These members I conceive and believe him to be","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21435",4705,"possessed of. Nothing can be more evident, than that this whole","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21436",4705,"operation is performed by the thought or imagination alone. The","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21437",4705,"transition is immediate. The ideas presently strike us. Their customary","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21438",4705,"connexion with the present impression, varies them and modifies them in","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21439",4705,"a certain manner, but produces no act of the mind, distinct from this","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21440",4705,"peculiarity of conception. Let any one examine his own mind, and he will","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21443",4705,"Secondly, Whatever may be the case, with regard to this distinct","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21444",4705,"impression, it must be allowed, that the mind has a firmer hold, or","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21445",4705,"more steady conception of what it takes to be matter of fact, than of","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21451",4705,"conception exhaust the whole subject, and nothing is left to produce any","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21452",4705,"other effect. An inference concerning a matter of fact is nothing but","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21453",4705,"the idea of an object, that is frequently conjoined, or is associated","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21454",4705,"with a present impression. This is the whole of it. Every part is","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21455",4705,"requisite to explain, from analogy, the more steady conception; and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21456",4705,"nothing remains capable of producing any distinct impression.","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21458",4705,"Fourthly, The effects of belief, in influencing the passions and","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21474",4705,"find the cause of the firmness and strength of conception: And this I do","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21475",4705,"not esteem a difficult task. The transition from a present impression,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21476",4705,"always enlivens and strengthens any idea. When any object is presented,","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
"21477",4705,"the idea of its usual attendant immediately strikes us, as something","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"

"21479",4705,"impression, from which it is derived, in its force and influence. This I","A Treatise of Human Nature","Hume, David","Philosophy","en"
