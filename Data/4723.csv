"460",4723,"it. For example, having demonstrated that the three angles of an isosceles","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"1341",4723,"use of the word IDEA, and do not rather in compliance with custom","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"1343",4723,"the term THING in contra-distinction to IDEA, is generally supposed","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"1386",4723,"may be considered that in a DREAM we do oft perceive things as","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"2589",4723,"necessary to conceive more bodies than one, yet it may be that one","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"2593",4723,"which changes its distance from some other body, whether the force","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"2596",4723,"the ordinary affairs of life, it should seem that every man of common","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2597",4723,"sense knows what it is as well as the best philosopher. Now, I ask any","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2598",4723,"one whether, in his sense of motion as he walks along the streets, the","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2599",4723,"stones he passes over may be said to move, because they change distance","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2600",4723,"with his feet? To me it appears that though motion includes a relation of","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2601",4723,"one thing to another, yet it is not necessary that each term of the","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2602",4723,"relation be denominated from it. As a man may think of somewhat which","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2603",4723,"does not think, so a body may be moved to or from another body which is","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2604",4723,"not therefore itself in motion.","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2605",4723,"","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2606",4723,"114. As the place happens to be variously defined, the motion which is","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2607",4723,"related to it varies. A man in a ship may be said to be quiescent with","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2608",4723,"relation to the sides of the vessel, and yet move with relation to the","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2609",4723,"land. Or he may move eastward in respect of the one, and westward in","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2610",4723,"respect of the other. In the common affairs of life men never go beyond","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2611",4723,"the earth to define the place of any body; and what is quiescent in","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2612",4723,"respect of that is accounted absolutely to be so. But philosophers, who","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2613",4723,"have a greater extent of thought, and juster notions of the system of","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2614",4723,"things, discover even the earth itself to be moved. In order therefore to","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2615",4723,"fix their notions they seem to conceive the corporeal world as finite,","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2616",4723,"and the utmost unmoved walls or shell thereof to be the place whereby","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2617",4723,"they estimate true motions. If we sound our own conceptions, I believe we","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2618",4723,"may find all the absolute motion we can frame an idea of to be at bottom","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2619",4723,"no other than relative motion thus defined. For, as has been already","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2620",4723,"observed, absolute motion, exclusive of all external relation, is","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2621",4723,"incomprehensible; and to this kind of relative motion all the","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2622",4723,"above-mentioned properties, causes, and effects ascribed to absolute","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2623",4723,"motion will, if I mistake not, be found to agree. As to what is said of","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2624",4723,"the centrifugal force, that it does not at all belong to circular","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2625",4723,"relative motion, I do not see how this follows from the experiment which","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2626",4723,"is brought to prove it. See Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2627",4723,"in Schol. Def. VIII. For the water in the vessel at that time wherein it","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2628",4723,"is said to have the greatest relative circular motion, has, I think, no","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2629",4723,"motion at all; as is plain from the foregoing section.","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2630",4723,"","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2631",4723,"115. For, to denominate a body moved it is requisite, first, that it","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2632",4723,"change its distance or situation with regard to some other body; and","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2633",4723,"secondly, that the force occasioning that change be applied to it. If","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2634",4723,"either of these be wanting, I do not think that, agreeably to the sense","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2635",4723,"of mankind, or the propriety of language, a body can be said to be in","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2636",4723,"motion. I grant indeed that it is possible for us to think a body which","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2637",4723,"we see change its distance from some other to be moved, though it have no","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2638",4723,"force applied to it (in which sense there may be apparent motion), but","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2639",4723,"then it is because the force causing the change of distance is imagined","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2640",4723,"by us to be applied or impressed on that body thought to move; which","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2641",4723,"indeed shows we are capable of mistaking a thing to be in motion which is","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2642",4723,"not, and that is all.","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"2644",4723,"116. ANY IDEA OF PURE SPACE RELATIVE.--From what has been said it follows","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2645",4723,"that the philosophic consideration of motion does not imply the","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2646",4723,"being of an absolute Space, distinct from that which is perceived","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2647",4723,"by sense and related bodies; which that it cannot exist without the","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2648",4723,"mind is clear upon the same principles that demonstrate the like","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2649",4723,"of all other objects of sense. And perhaps, if we inquire narrowly,","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2650",4723,"we shall find we cannot even frame an idea of pure Space exclusive","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2651",4723,"of all body. This I must confess seems impossible, as being a most","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2652",4723,"abstract idea. When I excite a motion in some part of my body,","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2653",4723,"if it be free or without resistance, I say there is Space; but if I","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2654",4723,"find a resistance, then I say there is Body; and in proportion as the","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2655",4723,"resistance to motion is lesser or greater, I say the space is more or","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2656",4723,"less pure. So that when I speak of pure or empty space, it is not to be","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2657",4723,"supposed that the word ""space"" stands for an idea distinct from or","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2658",4723,"conceivable without body and motion--though indeed we are apt to think","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2659",4723,"every noun substantive stands for a distinct idea that may be separated","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2660",4723,"from all others; which has occasioned infinite mistakes. When, therefore,","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2661",4723,"supposing all the world to be annihilated besides my own body, I say","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2662",4723,"there still remains pure Space, thereby nothing else is meant but only","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2663",4723,"that I conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be moved on all","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2664",4723,"sides without the least resistance, but if that, too, were annihilated","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2665",4723,"then there could be no motion, and consequently no Space. Some, perhaps,","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2666",4723,"may think the sense of seeing doth furnish them with the idea of pure","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"2667",4723,"space; but it is plain from what we have elsewhere shown, that the ideas","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"3017",4723,"if we had, we might know our own soul as we do a triangle. To this","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"3018",4723,"I answer, that, in case we had a new sense bestowed upon us, we","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"3019",4723,"could only receive thereby some new sensations or ideas of sense.","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"3040",4723,"","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"3041",4723,"138. I answer, if it does not in those mentioned, it is impossible it","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"3044",4723,"wherein the idea can be like a spirit. For, by the word spirit we mean","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"3049",4723,"","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"3050",4723,"139. But it will be objected that, if there is no idea signified by the","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
"3051",4723,"terms soul, spirit, and substance, they are wholly insignificant, or have","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"3053",4723,"thing, which is neither an idea nor like an idea, but that which","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"

"3061",4723,"that they are entirely passive, and their existence consists only in","A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","Berkeley, George","Philosophy","en"
