"266",4920,"just discovered one of the senses. He was a splendid man and, if the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"267",4920,"word may be employed of the sterner sex, one of beauty. His features","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"268",4920,"were even; that is to be noted, his nose chiselled straight and to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"296",4920,"It was a most fortunate incident. It was a strange case. That mere act","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"304",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"305",4920,"The man was not hard to distinguish; he was standing on the forward deck","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"306",4920,"facing the wind and peering through the mist at the grey, heavy heave of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"307",4920,"the water. Alongside of them the dim shadow of a sister ferry screamed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"308",4920,"its way through the fogbank. That he was a landsman was evidenced by his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"310",4920,"shift sidewise. An unusually heavy roll caught him slightly off-balance","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"311",4920,"and jostled him against the detective. The latter held up his hand and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"312",4920,"caught him by the arm.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"319",4920,"cigar clerk. The same effect of the age melting into youth and--the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"320",4920,"officer being much more accustomed to reading men--a queer sense of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"321",4920,"latent and potent vision. The eyes were soft and receptive but for","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"322",4920,"all that of the delicate strength and colour that comes from abnormal","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"349",4920,"It was an answer altogether unexpected. Again the officer found himself","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"350",4920,"gazing into the strange, refined face and wonderful eyes. The man was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"351",4920,"not blind, of that he was certain. Neither was his voice harsh or testy.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"352",4920,"Rather was it soft and polite, of one merely stating a fact. Yet how","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"353",4920,"could it be? He remembered the cigar clerk. Neither cigar nor sun! From","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"354",4920,"what manner of land could the man come? A detective has a certain","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"355",4920,"gift of intuition. Though on the face of it, outside of the man's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"356",4920,"personality, there could be nothing to it but a joke, he chose to act","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"357",4920,"upon the impulse. He pulled back the door which had been closed behind","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"380",4920,"and beyond at the citied shoreline, whose sea of housetops extended and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"739",4920,"in any way whatsoever; nor did he know a single thing of philosophy","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"740",4920,"or anything else in Holcomb's teaching. He knew the doctor as a man","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"741",4920,"of eminent standing and respectability. It was hardly natural that he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"742",4920,"should suspect anything sinister to grow out of this meeting of two","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"743",4920,"refined scholars. He attached no great importance to the trend of their","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"758",4920,"Jerome could not crowd too closely. He had no certainty of trouble; no","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"759",4920,"proof whatever; he was known to the professor. The best he could do was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"760",4920,"to keep aloof and follow their movements. At the ferry building they","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"761",4920,"hailed a taxi and started up Market Street. Jerome watched them. In","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"762",4920,"another moment he had another driver and was winding behind in their","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"763",4920,"wheel tracks. The cab made straight for Chatterton Place. In front of a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"764",4920,"substantial two-story house it drew up. The two men alighted. Jerome's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"766",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"767",4920,"They were then at the head of the steps; a woman of slender beauty","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"768",4920,"with a wonderful loose fold of black hair was talking. It seemed to the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"769",4920,"detective that her voice was fearful, of a pregnant warning, that she","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"770",4920,"was protesting. Nevertheless, the old men entered and the door slammed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"771",4920,"behind them. Jerome slipped from the taxi and spoke a few words to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"772",4920,"the driver. A moment later the two men were holding the house under","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"773",4920,"surveillance.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"774",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"775",4920,"They did not have long to wait. The man called Rhamda had asked for","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"776",4920,"fifteen minutes. At the stroke of the second the front door re-opened.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"777",4920,"Someone was laughing; a melodious enchanting laugh and feminine. A woman","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"778",4920,"was speaking. And then there were two forms in the doorway. A man and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"779",4920,"a woman. The man was Rhamda Avec, tall, immaculate, black clad and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"780",4920,"distinguished. The woman, Jerome was not certain that she was the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"781",4920,"same who opened the door or not; she was even more beautiful. She","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"782",4920,"was laughing. Like her companion she was clad in black, a beautiful","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"783",4920,"shimmering material which sparkled in the sun like the rarest silk.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"784",4920,"The man glanced carelessly up and down the street for a moment. Then he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"785",4920,"assisted the lady down the steps and into the taxi. The door slammed;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"786",4920,"and before the detective could gather his scattered wits they were lost","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"787",4920,"in the city.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"788",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"789",4920,"Jerome was expecting the professor. Naturally when the door opened he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"790",4920,"looked for the old gentleman and his companion. It was the doctor he was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"791",4920,"watching, not the other. Though he had no rational reason for expecting","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"792",4920,"trouble he had still his hunch and his intuition. The man and woman","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"793",4920,"aroused suspicion; and likewise upset his calculation. He could not","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"794",4920,"follow them and stay with the professor. It was a moment for quick","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"795",4920,"decision. He wondered. Where was Dr. Holcomb? This was the day he was to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"796",4920,"deliver his lecture on the Blind Spot. He had read the announcement in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"797",4920,"the paper on the way back, together with certain comments by the editor.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"798",4920,"In the lecture itself there was mystery. This strange one, Rhamda,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"799",4920,"was mixed in the Blind Spot. Undoubtedly he was the essential fact and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"800",4920,"substance. Until now he had not scented tragedy. Why had Rhamda and the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"801",4920,"woman come out together? Where was the professor?","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"802",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"805",4920,"At the end of a half-hour Jerome ventured across the street. He noted","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"806",4920,"the number 288. Then he ascended the steps and clanged at the knocker.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"807",4920,"From the sounds that came from inside, the place was but partly","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"808",4920,"furnished. Hollow steps sounded down the hallway, shuffling, like weary","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"810",4920,"peered out of the crack. She coughed. Though it was not a loud cough","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1425",4920,"It happened as it happened since God first made the maiden. One autumn","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1434",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1435",4920,"It was a night in September. Hobart had completed his affairs and had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1436",4920,"booked passage to South America. He was to sail next morning. We had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1437",4920,"dinner that day with his family, and then came up to San Francisco for","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1438",4920,"a last and farewell bachelor night. We could take in the opera together,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1439",4920,"have supper at our favourite cafe, and then turn in. It was a long hark","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1440",4920,"back to our childhood; but for all that we were still boys together.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1441",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1442",4920,"I remember that night. It was our favourite opera--""Faust."" It was the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1443",4920,"one piece that we could agree on. Looking back since, I have wondered at","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1444",4920,"the coincidence. The old myth of age to youth and the subcurrent of sin","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1445",4920,"with its stalking, laughing, subtle Mephistopheles. It is strange that","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1446",4920,"we should have gone to this one opera on this one evening. I recall","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1447",4920,"our coming out of the theatre; our minds thrilling to the music and the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1448",4920,"subtle weirdness of the theme.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1449",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1450",4920,"A fog had fallen--one of those thick, heavy, grey mists that sometimes","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1451",4920,"come upon us in September. Into its sombre depths the crowd disappeared","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1452",4920,"like shadows. The lights upon the streets blurred yellow. At the cold","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1453",4920,"sheer contact we hesitated upon the pavement.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1454",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1455",4920,"I had on a light overcoat. Hobart, bound for the tropics, had no such","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1456",4920,"protection. It was cold and miserable, a chill wind stirring from the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1457",4920,"north was unusually cutting. Hobart raised his collar and dug his hands","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1458",4920,"into his pockets.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1459",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1462",4920,"The sidewalks were wet and slippery, the mists settling under the lights","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1472",4920,"voice. He stood still and peered into the fog bank. His stop was sudden","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1473",4920,"and suggestive. Just then a passing taxicab almost caught us and we","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1474",4920,"were compelled to dodge quickly. Hobart ducked out of the way and I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1475",4920,"side-stepped in another direction. We came up on the sidewalk. Again he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1502",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1504",4920,"During the past few days I had been thinking of Dr. Holcomb; and for the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1505",4920,"last few hours the tale had clung with reiterating persistence. Perhaps","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1506",4920,"it was the weirdness and the tremulous intoxication of the music. I was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1507",4920,"one of the vast majority who disbelieved it. Was it possible that it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1508",4920,"was, after all, other than the film of fancy? There are times when we","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1509",4920,"are receptive; at that moment I could have believed it.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1510",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1511",4920,"We entered the cafe and chose a table slightly to the rear. It was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1512",4920,"a contrast to the cold outside; the lights so bright, the glasses","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1513",4920,"clinking, laughter and music. A few young people were dancing. I sat","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1514",4920,"down; in a moment the lightness and jollity had stirred my blood. Hobart","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1515",4920,"took a chair opposite. The place was full of beauty. In the back of my","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1516",4920,"mind blurred the image of Rhamda. I had never seen him; but I had read","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1517",4920,"the description. I wondered absently at the persistence.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1518",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1519",4920,"I have said that I do not believe in fate. I repeat it. Man should","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1520",4920,"control his own destiny. A great man does. Perhaps that is it. I am not","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1522",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1523",4920,"In the back part of the room at one of the tables was a young man","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1524",4920,"sitting alone. Something caught my attention. Perhaps it was his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1525",4920,"listlessness or the dreamy unconcern with which he watched the dancers;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1526",4920,"or it may have been the utter forlornness of his expression. I noted his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1527",4920,"unusual pallor and his cast of dissipation, also the continual working","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1528",4920,"of his long, lean fingers. There are certain set fixtures in the night","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1529",4920,"life of any city. But this was not one. He was not an habitue. There was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1530",4920,"a certain greatness to his loneliness and his isolation. I wondered.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1531",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1532",4920,"Just then he looked up. By a mere coincidence our eyes met. He smiled,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1533",4920,"a weak smile and a forlorn one, and it seemed to me rather pitiful. Then","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1534",4920,"as suddenly his glance wandered to the door behind me. Perhaps there","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1535",4920,"was something in my expression that caught Hobart's attention. He turned","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1536",4920,"about.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1542",4920,"The young man looked up again. The same weary smile. He nodded. And","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1543",4920,"again he glanced over my shoulder toward the door. His face suddenly","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1544",4920,"hardened.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1545",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1547",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1548",4920,"Now Hobart was sitting with his face toward the entrance. He could see","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1549",4920,"anyone coming or going. Following the young man's glance he looked over","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1550",4920,"my shoulder. He suddenly reached over and took me by the forearm.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1551",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1552",4920,"""Don't look round,"" he warned; ""take it easy. As I said--on my honour as","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1554",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1555",4920,"The very words foretold. I could not but risk a glance. Across the room","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1556",4920,"a man was coming down the aisle--a tall man, dark, and of a very decided","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1557",4920,"manner. I had read his description many times; I had seen his likeness","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1558",4920,"drawn by certain sketch artists of the city. They did not do him","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1559",4920,"justice. He had a wonderful way and presence--you might say, magnetism.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1560",4920,"I noticed the furtive wondering glances that were cast, especially by","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1561",4920,"the women. He was a handsome man beyond denying, about the handsomest I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1562",4920,"had ever seen. The same elusiveness.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1563",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1564",4920,"At first I would have sworn him to be near sixty; the next minute I was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1565",4920,"just as certain of his youth. There was something about him that could","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1566",4920,"not be put to paper, be it strength, force or vitality; he was subtle.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1567",4920,"His step was prim and distinctive, light as shadow, in one hand","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1568",4920,"he carried the red case that was so often mentioned. I breathed an","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1569",4920,"exclamation.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1570",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1571",4920,"Hobart nodded.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1572",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1573",4920,"""Am I a fat man? The famous Rhamda! What say! Ah, ha! He has business","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1575",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1576",4920,"And it was so. He took a chair opposite the wan one. The young man","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1577",4920,"straightened. His face was even more familiar, but I could not place","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1578",4920,"him. His lips were set; in their grim line--determination; whatever his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1579",4920,"exhaustion there was still a will. Somehow one had a respect for this","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1580",4920,"weak one; he was not a mere weakling. Yet I was not so sure that he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1581",4920,"was not afraid of the Rhamda. He spoke to the waiter. The Rhamda began","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1582",4920,"talking. I noted the poise in his manner; it was not evil, rather was it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1583",4920,"calm--and calculating. He made an indication. The young man drew back.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1584",4920,"He smiled; it was feeble and weary, but for all of that disdainful.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1585",4920,"Though one had a pity for his forlornness, there was still an","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1586",4920,"admiration. The waiter brought glasses.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1588",4920,"The young man swallowed his drink at a gulp, the other picked his up and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1589",4920,"sipped it. Again he made the indication. The youth dropped his hand upon","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1590",4920,"the table, a pale blue light followed the movement of his fingers. The","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1591",4920,"older man pointed. So that was their contention? A jewel? After all our","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1592",4920,"phantom was material enough to desire possession; his solicitude was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1593",4920,"calmness, but for all that aggression. I could sense a battle, but the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1594",4920,"young man turned the jewel to the palm side of his fingers; he shook his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1595",4920,"head.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1596",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1597",4920,"The Rhamda drew up. For a moment he waited. Was it for surrender? Once","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1598",4920,"he started to speak, but was cut short by the other. For all of his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1599",4920,"weakness there was spirit to the young man. He even laughed. The Rhamda","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1600",4920,"drew out a watch. He held up two fingers. I heard Hobart mumble.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1601",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1602",4920,"""Two minutes. Well, I'm betting on the young one. Too much soul. He's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"1607",4920,"He lit a cigarette; from the flicker and jerk of the flame he was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1608",4920,"trembling. But he was still emphatic. The other rose from the table,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"1609",4920,"walked down the aisle and out of the building. The youth spread out both","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"2159",4920,"door. Whether it was the ring or not I do not know. At the time I did","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"2160",4920,"not reason. I acted upon impulse. It was an act beyond good breeding. I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"2167",4920,"bridged nose and the red, red lips that smiled, it seemed to me, in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"2168",4920,"sadness. She hesitated, and as if puzzled, lifted a jewelled hand to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"2169",4920,"her raven mass of hair. To this minute I cannot account for my action,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"2176",4920,"Somewhere I had seen her, had known her. She was looking and she was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"2570",4920,"of incandescence. Hobart turned and I leaped. It was a blur, the form","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"2571",4920,"of a man melting into nothing. I sprang into the room, tearing down the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4394",4920,"always been a lover of dogs. I was lonely. There is a bond between a dog","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4405",4920,"Happily Jerome was fond of dogs. He was reading. When I entered with","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4406",4920,"Queen tugging at the chain he looked up. The dog recognised the heart","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4407",4920,"of the man; when he stooped to pet her she moved her stub tail in an","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4408",4920,"effusion of affectionate acceptance. Jerome had been reading Le Bon's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4409",4920,"theory on the evolution of force. His researches after the mystery had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4410",4920,"led him into the depths of speculation; he had become quite a scholar.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4411",4920,"After our first greeting I unhooked the chain and let Queen have the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4412",4920,"freedom of the house. I related what had happened. The detective closed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4413",4920,"the book and sat down. The dog waited a bit for further petting; but","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4414",4920,"missing that she began sniffing about the room. There was nothing","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4415",4920,"strange about it of course. I myself paid not the slightest attention.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4416",4920,"But the detective was watching. While I was telling my story he was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4417",4920,"following every movement of the shepherd. Suddenly he held up one","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4418",4920,"finger. I turned.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4419",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4420",4920,"It was Queen. A low growl, guttural and suspicious. She was standing","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4421",4920,"about a foot from the portieres that separated the library from the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4422",4920,"other room--where we had lost Watson, and where Jerome had had his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4423",4920,"experience with the old lady. Tense and rigid, one forepaw held up","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4424",4920,"stealthily, her stub tail erect and the hair along her back bristled.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4425",4920,"Again the low growl. I caught Jerome's eyes. It was queer.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4426",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4427",4920,"""What is it, Queen?"" I spoke.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4428",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4429",4920,"At the sound of my voice she wagged her tail and looked round, then","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4430",4920,"stepped between the curtains. Just her head. She drew back; her lips","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4431",4920,"drawn from her teeth, snarling. She was rigid, alert, vitalised. Somehow","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4432",4920,"it made me cold. She was a brave dog; she feared nothing. The detective","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4433",4920,"stepped forward and pulled the curtains apart. The room was empty. We","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4434",4920,"looked into each other's faces. What is there to instinct? What is its","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4435",4920,"range? We could see nothing.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4436",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4437",4920,"But not to the dog. Her eyes glowed. Hate, fear, terror, her whole body","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4439",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4440",4920,"""I wonder,"" I said. I stepped into the room. But I hadn't counted on the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4441",4920,"dog. With a yelp she was upon me, had me by the calf of the leg and was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4442",4920,"drawing me back. She stepped in front of me; a low, guttural growl of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4443",4920,"warning. But there was nothing in that room; of that we were certain.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4444",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4445",4920,"""Beats me,"" said the detective. ""How does she know? Wonder if she would","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4446",4920,"stop me?"" He stepped forward. It was merely a repetition. She caught","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4447",4920,"him by the trouser-leg and drew him back. She crowded us away from the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4448",4920,"curtain. It was almost magnetic. We could see nothing, neither could we","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4449",4920,"feel; was it possible that the dog could see beyond us? The detective","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4450",4920,"spoke first:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4451",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4452",4920,"""Take her out of the room. Put her in the hall; tie her up.""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4453",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4454",4920,"""What's the idea?""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4455",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4456",4920,"""Merely this; I am going to examine the room. No, I am not afraid. I'll","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4457",4920,"be mighty glad if it does catch me. Anything so long as I get results.""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4458",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4459",4920,"But it did us no good. We examined the room many times that night; both","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4460",4920,"of us. In the end there was nothing, only the weirdness and uncertainty","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4461",4920,"and the magnetic undercurrent which we could feel, but could not fathom.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4462",4920,"When we called in the dog she stepped to the portieres and commenced her","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4463",4920,"vigil. She crouched slightly behind the curtains, alert, ready, waiting,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4464",4920,"at her post of honour. From that moment she never left the spot except","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4465",4920,"under compulsion. We could hear her at all times of the night; the low","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4466",4920,"growl, the snarl, the defiance.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4467",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4468",4920,"But there was a great deal more that we were to learn from the dog. It","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4469",4920,"was Jerome who first called my attention. A small fact at the beginning;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4470",4920,"but of a strange sequence. This time it was the ring. Queen had the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4471",4920,"habit that is common to most dogs; she would lick my hand to show her","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4472",4920,"affection. It was nothing in itself; but for one fact--she always chose","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4473",4920,"the left hand. It was the detective who first noticed it. Always and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4474",4920,"every opportunity she would lick the jewel. We made a little test to try","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4475",4920,"her. I would remove the ring from one hand to the other; then hold it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4476",4920,"behind me. She would follow.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4477",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4478",4920,"It was a strange fact; but of course not inexplicable. A scent or the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4479",4920,"attraction of taste might account for it. However, these little tests","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4480",4920,"led to a rather remarkable discovery.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4481",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4482",4920,"One night we had called the dog from her vigil. As usual she came to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4483",4920,"the jewel; by chance I pressed the gem against her head. It was a mere","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4484",4920,"trifle; yet it was of consequence. A few minutes before I had dropped a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4485",4920,"handkerchief on the opposite side of the room; I was just thinking about","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4486",4920,"picking it up. It was only a small thing, yet it put us on the track","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4487",4920,"of the gem's strangest potency. The dog walked to the handkerchief. She","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4488",4920,"brought it back in her mouth. At first I took it for a pure coincidence.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4489",4920,"I repeated the experiment with a book. The same result. I looked up at","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4490",4920,"Jerome.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4491",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4492",4920,"""What's the matter?"" Then when I explained: ""The dickens! Try it again.""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4493",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4494",4920,"Over and over again we repeated it, using different articles, pieces of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4495",4920,"which I was certain she didn't know the name. There was a strange bond","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4496",4920,"between the gem and the intelligence, some strange force emanating from","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4497",4920,"its lustre. On myself it was depressing; on the dog it was life itself.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4498",4920,"At last Jerome had an inspiration.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4499",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4500",4920,"""Try the Rhamda,"" he said; ""think of him. Perhaps--""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4501",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4502",4920,"It was most surprising. Certainly it was remarkable. It was too much","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4503",4920,"like intelligence; a bit too uncanny. At the instant of the thought the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4504",4920,"dog leaped backward.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4505",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4506",4920,"Such a strange transformation; she was naturally gentle. In one","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4507",4920,"instant she had gone mad. Mad? Not in the literal interpretation; but","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4508",4920,"figuratively. She sprang back, snapping; her teeth bared, her hair","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4509",4920,"bristled. Her nostrils drawn. With one bound she leaped between the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4510",4920,"curtains.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4511",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4512",4920,"Jerome jumped up. With an exclamation he drew the portieres. I was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4513",4920,"behind him. The dog was standing at the edge of the room, bristling.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4514",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4515",4920,"The room was empty. What did she see? What?","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4516",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4517",4920,"One thing was certain. Though we were sure of nothing else we were","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4518",4920,"certain of the Rhamda. We could trust the canine's instinct. Every","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4519",4920,"previous experiment we had essayed had been crowned with success. We had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4520",4920,"here a fact but no explanation. If we could only put things together and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4521",4920,"extract the law.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4522",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4523",4920,"It was late when we retired. I could not sleep. The restlessness of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4524",4920,"dog held back my slumber. She would growl sullenly, then stir about for","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4525",4920,"a new position; she was never quite still. I could picture her there","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4526",4920,"in the library, behind the curtains, crouched, half resting, half","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4527",4920,"slumbering, always watching. I would awaken in the night and listen; a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4528",4920,"low guttural warning, a sullen whine--then stillness. It was the same","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4529",4920,"with my companion. We could never quite understand it. Perhaps we were a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4530",4920,"bit afraid.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4531",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4532",4920,"But one can become accustomed to almost anything. It went on for many","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4533",4920,"nights without anything happening, until one night.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4534",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4535",4920,"It was dark, exceedingly dark, with neither moon nor starlight; one of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4536",4920,"those nights of inky intenseness. I cannot say just exactly what woke","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4537",4920,"me. The house was strangely silent and still; the air seemed stretched","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4538",4920,"and laden. It was summer. Perhaps it was the heat. I only knew that I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4539",4920,"woke suddenly and blinked in the darkness.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4540",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4541",4920,"In the next room with the door open I could hear the heavy breathing","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4542",4920,"of the detective. A heavy feeling lay against my heart. I had grown","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4543",4920,"accustomed to dread and isolation; but this was different. Perhaps","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4544",4920,"it was premonition. I do not know. And yet I was terribly sleepy; I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4545",4920,"remember that.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4546",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4547",4920,"I struck a match and looked at my watch on the bureau--twelve","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4548",4920,"thirty-five. No sound--not even Queen--not even a rumble from the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4549",4920,"streets. I lay back and dropped into slumber. Just as I drifted off to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4550",4920,"sleep I had a blurring fancy of sound, guttural, whining, fearful--then","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4551",4920,"suddenly drifting into incoherent rumbling phantasms--a dream. I awoke","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4552",4920,"suddenly. Someone was speaking. It was Jerome.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4553",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4556",4920,"I was frightened. It was like something clutching out of the darkness.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4557",4920,"I sat up. I didn't answer. It wasn't necessary. The incoherence of my","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4558",4920,"dream had been external. The library was just below me. I could hear the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4559",4920,"dog pacing to and fro, and her snarling. Snarling? It was just that. It","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4560",4920,"was something to arouse terror.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4561",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4562",4920,"She had never growled like that--I was positive, I could hear her","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4563",4920,"suddenly leap back from the curtains. She barked. Never before had she","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4564",4920,"come to that. Then a sudden lunge into the other room--a vicious series","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4565",4920,"of snapping barks, yelps--pandemonium--I could picture her leaping--at","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4566",4920,"what? Then suddenly I leaped out of bed. The barks grew faint, faint,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4567",4920,"fainter--into the distance.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4568",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4569",4920,"In the darkness I couldn't find the switch. I bumped into Jerome. We","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4570",4920,"were lost in our confusion. It was a moment before we could find either","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4571",4920,"a match or a switch to turn on the lights. But at last--I shall not","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4572",4920,"forget that moment; nor Jerome. He was rigid; one arm held","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4573",4920,"aloft, his eyes bulged out. The whole house was full of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4574",4920,"sound--full-toned--vibrant--magnetic. It was the bell.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4575",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4576",4920,"I jumped for the stairway, but not so quick as Jerome. With three bounds","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4577",4920,"we were in the library with the lights on. The sound was running down","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4578",4920,"to silence. We tore down the curtains and rushed into the room. It was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4579",4920,"empty!","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4580",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4581",4920,"There was not even the dog. Queen had gone! In a vain rush of grief I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4587",4920,"nothing. Only the ring. At the suggestion of the detective I touched the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4588",4920,"match to the sapphire. It was the same. The colour diminishing, and the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4589",4920,"translucent corridors deepening into the distance; then the blur and the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4590",4920,"coming of shadows--the men, Watson and the professor--and my dog.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4591",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4592",4920,"Of the men, only the heads showed; but the dog was full figure; she was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4594",4920,"mouth and her face of that gentle intelligence which only the Australian","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4595",4920,"shepherd is heir to. That is all--no more--nothing. If we had hoped to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4603",4920,"fear. Nevertheless, the thing was magnetic. A subtle weirdness pervaded","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4604",4920,"the building. I did not sleep soundly. I was lonely; the isolation was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4672",4920,"It was about eight months after Hobart had left for South America. I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4673",4920,"remember those eight months as the longest in my life; because of Harry.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4674",4920,"I am a girl and I like attention; all girls do. Ordinarily he would come","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4675",4920,"over every fortnight at least. After Hobart had gone he came once only,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4676",4920,"and of course I resented the inattention.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4677",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4678",4920,"It seemed to me that no business could be of enough importance if he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4679",4920,"really loved me. Even his letters were few and far between. What he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4680",4920,"wrote were slow and weary and of an undertone that I could not fathom.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4686",4920,"Afraid? I will not say that--exactly. It was rather a suspicion, a queer","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4687",4920,"undercurrent of wonder and doubt. The beauty of the girl, her interest","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4688",4920,"in Harry and myself, her concern over this ring, put me a bit on guard.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4689",4920,"I wondered what this ring had to do with Harry Wendel.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4690",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4691",4920,"She did not tell me in exact words or in literal explanation; but she","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4692",4920,"managed to convey all too well a lurking impression of its sinister","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4693",4920,"potency. It was something baleful, something the very essence of which","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4694",4920,"would break down the life of one who wore it. Harry had come into its","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4695",4920,"possession by accident and she would save him. She had failed through","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4696",4920,"direct appeal. Now she had come to me. She did not say a word of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4697",4920,"Blind Spot.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4698",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4699",4920,"And the next day came Harry. It was really a shock, though I had been","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4700",4920,"warned by the girl. He was not Harry at all, but another. His eyes were","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4701",4920,"dim and they had lost their lustre; when they did show light at all,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4702",4920,"it was a kind that was a bit fearful. He was wan, worn, and shrunk to a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4703",4920,"shadow, as if he had gone through a long illness.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4704",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4705",4920,"He said he had not been sick. He maintained that he was quite well","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4706",4920,"physically. And on his finger was the ring of which the girl had spoken.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4707",4920,"Its value must have been incalculable. Wherever he moved his hand its","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4708",4920,"blue flame cut a path through the darkness. But he said nothing about","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4709",4920,"it. I waited and wondered and was afraid. It was not until our walk","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4710",4920,"under the elm trees that it was mentioned.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4711",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4712",4920,"It was a full moon; a wonderful, mellow moon of summer. He stopped","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4713",4920,"suddenly and gazed up at the orb above us. It seemed to me that his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4714",4920,"mind was wandering, he held me closely--tenderly. He was not at all","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4715",4920,"like Harry. There was a missing of self, of individuality; he spoke in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4716",4920,"abstractions.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4717",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4719",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4720",4920,"And then I asked him. He has already told of our conversation. It was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4721",4920,"the ring of which the Nervina had told me. It had to do with the Blind","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4722",4920,"Spot--the great secret that had taken Dr. Holcomb. He would not give it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4723",4920,"to me. I worked hard, for even then I was not afraid of it. Something","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4724",4920,"told me--I must do it to save him. It was weird, and something I could","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4725",4920,"not understand--but I must do it for Harry.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4726",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4727",4920,"I failed. Though he was broken in every visible way there was one thing","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4728",4920,"as strong as ever--his honour. He was not afraid; he had been the same","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4729",4920,"in his boyhood. When we parted that night he kissed me. I shall never","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4730",4920,"forget how long he looked into my eyes, nor his sadness. That is all.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4732",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4733",4920,"And then came the end. A message; abrupt and sudden. It was some time","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4734",4920,"after and put a period to my increasing stress and worry. It read:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4739",4920,"It was a short message and a bit twisted. In ordinary circumstances he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4740",4920,"would have motored down and brought me back to greet Hobart. It was a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4741",4920,"bit strange that I should meet him at the pier. However, I had barely","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4746",4920,"It was dark when I reached San Francisco. I was a full twenty minutes","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4747",4920,"early at the pier. A few people were waiting. I looked about for Harry.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4748",4920,"He was to meet me and I was certain that I would find him. But he was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4749",4920,"not there. Of course there was still time. He was sure to be on hand to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4751",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4752",4920,"Nevertheless, I had a vague mistrust. Since that strange visit I had not","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4753",4920,"been sure. Harry wasn't well. There was something to this mystery that","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4754",4920,"he had not told me. Why had he asked me to meet him at the pier? Why","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4755",4920,"didn't he come? When the boat docked and he was still missing I was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4756",4920,"doubly worried.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4757",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4758",4920,"Hobart came down the gangplank. He was great, strong, healthy, and it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4759",4920,"seemed to me in a terrible hurry. He scanned the faces hurriedly and ran","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4760",4920,"over to me.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4761",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4764",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4768",4920,"He was afraid. Plainly I could see that! There were lines of anxiety","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4776",4920,"frightened; but at that moment there was that in his eyes which I could","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4777",4920,"not understand. He caught me by the arm and started out almost at a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4778",4920,"run. There were many people and we dodged in and out among them. Hobart","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4779",4920,"carried a suitcase. He hailed a taxi.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4780",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4781",4920,"I don't know how I got into the car. It was a blur. I was frightened.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4782",4920,"Some terrible thing had occurred, and Hobart knew it. I remember a few","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4783",4920,"words spoken to the driver. ""Speed, speed, no limit; never mind the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4785",4920,"cobbled streets, a climbing over hills and twisted corners. And Hobart","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4786",4920,"at my side. ""Faster--faster,"" he was saying; ""faster! My lord, was there","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4793",4920,"as that light; it was grey, uncertain, scarcely a flicker. Perhaps","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"4802",4920,"wineglass. The gem upon his finger glowed with a flame that was almost","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"4803",4920,"wicked; it was blue, burning, giving out sparkles of light--like a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5148",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5149",4920,"Before resuming, however, I should mention one detail which Harry was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5150",4920,"too modest to mention. He was--or is--unusually good-looking. I don't","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5157",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5158",4920,"Moreover, simply because he had given his word to Chick Watson that he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5159",4920,"would wear the ring, Harry took upon himself the most dangerous task","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5160",4920,"that any man could assume, and he had lost. But had he known in advance","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5161",4920,"exactly what was going to happen to him, he would have stuck to his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5163",4920,"the thing was not perfectly sure to end tragically, he probably enjoyed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5168",4920,"a much greater admiration for results. For instance, I have seldom given","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5312",4920,"indicated a spot almost in the exact middle, a spot covering a space","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5321",4920,"though no liquid had ever touched it. Johnson dipped his brush into the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5338",4920,"traces of the varnish where, presumably, it had seeped through. There","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5339",4920,"was no sign. Then I inspected the reverse side of the finish, just","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5365",4920,"I sent Johnson after more varnish. Also, I secured several other fluids,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5367",4920,"returned we proceeded with a very thorough test indeed.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5368",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5369",4920,"Presently it became clear that we were dealing with a phenomenon of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5370",4920,"Blind Spot. All told, we poured about nine pints of liquid into an area","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5375",4920,"Ten minutes later I went down into the basement to dispose of some","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5376",4920,"rubbish. (Charlotte didn't know of this defection in our housekeeping.)","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5377",4920,"It was bright sunlight outside. Thanks to the basement windows, I needed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5378",4920,"no artificial luminant. And when my gaze rested upon the ground directly","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5379",4920,"under the parlour, I saw something there that I most certainly had never","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5381",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5382",4920,"The fact is, the basement at 288 Chatterton Place never did possess","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5384",4920,"Harry Wendel and Jerome, the detective, were the first in years to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5385",4920,"penetrate--except for that secret doorway, there was nothing down there","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5386",4920,"to attract attention. To be sure, there was a quantity of up-turned","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5387",4920,"earth, the result of Jerome's vigorous efforts to see whether or not","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5388",4920,"there was any connection between the Blind Spot phenomena which he had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5389",4920,"witnessed and the cellar. He had secured nothing but an appetite for all","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5391",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5392",4920,"However, it was still too dark for me to identify what I saw at once. I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5394",4920,"the thing gleamed oddly like a piece of glass, and that it possessed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5395",4920,"a nearly circular outline about two feet across, I couldn't tell much","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5398",4920,"Then I stooped and examined it closely. At once I became conscious of a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5514",4920,"Consequently, if I hoped to keep the man, and force him to tell us what","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5515",4920,"we wanted to know, then I must make use of something other than physical","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5516",4920,"means. Moreover, I gave him credit for an exceptional amount of insight.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5517",4920,"Call it super-instinct, or what you will, the fellow's intellect was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5520",4920,"Once having decided that it must be a battle of wits I took a step which","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5521",4920,"may seem, at first, a little peculiar.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5522",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5523",4920,"I called upon a certain lady to whom I shall give the name of Clarke,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5525",4920,"confidence. It is the only way, when dealing with a practitioner. And","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5526",4920,"since, like most of my fellow citizens, she had heard something of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5527",4920,"the come and go, elusive habits of our men, together with the Holcomb","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5528",4920,"affair, it was easy for her to understand just what I wanted.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5529",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5530",4920,"""I see,"" she mused. ""You wish to be surrounded by an influence that will","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5531",4920,"not so much protect you, as vitalise and strengthen you whenever you","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5532",4920,"come in contact with Avec. It will be a simple matter. How far do","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5533",4920,"you wish to go?"" And thus it was arranged, the plan calling for the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5534",4920,"co-operation of some twenty of her colleagues.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5535",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5536",4920,"My fellow engineers may sneer, if they like. I know the usual notion:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5537",4920,"that the ""power of mind over matter"" is all in the brain of the patient.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5538",4920,"That the efforts of the practitioner are merely inductive, and so on.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5539",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5540",4920,"But I think that the most sceptical will agree that I did quite right in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5541",4920,"seeking whatever support I could get before crossing swords with a man","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5542",4920,"as keen as Avec.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5545",4920,"intellectual machinery which my money had started into operation,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5546",4920,"something occurred which almost threw the whole thing out of gear.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5547",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5548",4920,"It was the evening after I had returned from Miss Clarke's office. Both","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5549",4920,"Charlotte and I had a premonition, after supper, that things were going","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5550",4920,"to happen. We all went into the parlour, sat down, and waited.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5551",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5552",4920,"Presently we started the gramophone. Jerome sat nearest the instrument,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5553",4920,"where he could without rising, lean over and change the records. And all","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5554",4920,"three of us recall that the selection being played at the moment was ""I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5555",4920,"Am Climbing Mountains,"" a sentimental little melody sung by a popular","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5556",4920,"tenor. Certainly the piece was far from being melancholy, mysterious, or","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5557",4920,"otherwise likely to attract the occult.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5558",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5559",4920,"I remember that we played it twice, and it was just as the singer","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5560",4920,"reached the beginning of the final chorus that Charlotte, who sat","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5561",4920,"nearest the door, made a quick move and shivered, as though with cold.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5562",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5563",4920,"From where I sat, near the dining-room door, I could see through into","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5564",4920,"the hall. Charlotte's action made me think that the door might have","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5565",4920,"become unlatched, allowing a draught to come through. Afterwards she","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5566",4920,"said that she had felt something rather like a breeze pass her chair.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5567",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5568",4920,"In the middle of the room stood a long, massive table, of conventional","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5569",4920,"library type. Overhead was a heavy, burnished copper fixture, from which","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5570",4920,"a cluster of electric bulbs threw their brilliance upward, so that the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5571",4920,"room was evenly lighted with the diffused rays as reflected from the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5572",4920,"ceiling. Thus, there were no shadows to confuse the problem.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5573",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5574",4920,"The chorus of the song was almost through when I heard from the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5575",4920,"direction of the table a faint sound, as though someone had drawn","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5576",4920,"fingers lightly across the polished oak. I listened; the sound was not","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5577",4920,"repeated, at least not loud enough for me to catch it above the music.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5578",4920,"Next moment, however, the record came to an end; Jerome leaned forward","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5579",4920,"to put on another, and Charlotte opened her mouth as though to suggest","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5580",4920,"what the new selection might be. But she never said the words.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5581",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5582",4920,"It began with a scintillating iridescence, up on the ceiling, not eight","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5583",4920,"feet from where I sat. As I looked the spot grew, and spread, and flared","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5584",4920,"out. It was blue like the elusive blue of the gem; only, it was more","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5585",4920,"like flame--the flame of electrical apparatus.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5586",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5587",4920,"Then, down from that blinding radiance there crept, rather than dropped","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5588",4920,"a single thread of incandescence, vivid, with a tinge of the colour","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5589",4920,"from which it had surged. Down it crept to the floor; it was like an","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5590",4920,"irregular streak of lightning, hanging motionless between ceiling and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5591",4920,"floor, just for the fraction of a second. All in total silence.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5592",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5593",4920,"And then the radiance vanished, disappeared, snuffed out as one might","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5594",4920,"snuff out a candle. And in its stead--","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5595",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5608",4920,"Even now I find it curiously hard to describe her. For me to say that","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5610",4920,"leave unsaid the secret of her loveliness.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5611",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5612",4920,"For this stranger, coming out of the thin air into our midst, held me","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5613",4920,"with a glorious fascination. From the first I felt no misgivings, such","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5614",4920,"as Harry confesses he experienced when he fell under the Nervina's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5615",4920,"charm. I knew as I watched the stranger's wondering, puzzled features,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5616",4920,"that I had never before seen anyone so lovely, so attractive, and so","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5617",4920,"utterly beyond suspicion.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5618",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5619",4920,"It was only later that I noted her amazingly delicate complexion, fair","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5620",4920,"as her hair was golden; her deep blue eyes, round face, and the girlish","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5621",4920,"supple figure; or her robe-like garments of very soft, white material.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5622",4920,"For she commenced almost instantly to talk.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5623",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5624",4920,"But we understood only with the greatest of difficulty. She spoke as","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5625",4920,"might one who, after living in perfect solitude for a score of years, is","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5626",4920,"suddenly called upon to use language. And I remembered that Rhamda Avec","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5627",4920,"had told Jerome that he had only BEGUN the use of language.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5628",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5629",4920,"""Who are you?"" was her first remark, in the sweetest voice conceivable.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5630",4920,"But there was both fear and anxiety in her manner. ""How--did","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5631",4920,"I--get--here?""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5632",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5633",4920,"""You came out of the Blind Spot!"" I spoke, jerking out the words","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5634",4920,"nervously and, as I saw, too rapidly. I repeated them more slowly. But","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5635",4920,"she did not comprehend.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5636",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5637",4920,"""The--Blind--Spot,"" she pondered. ""What--is that?""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5639",4920,"Next instant, before I could think to warn her, the room trembled with","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5640",4920,"the terrific clang of the Blind Spot bell. Just one overwhelming peal;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5641",4920,"no more. At the same time there came a revival of the luminous spot in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5646",4920,"with one hand--something that I had not dared to do as long as the Spot","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5647",4920,"remained open. The touch of my fingers, as she swayed, had the effect of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5648",4920,"bringing her to herself. She listened intelligently to what I said.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"5665",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5666",4920,"I noted the odd way in which the newcomer walked, unsteadily,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5667",4920,"uncertainly, like a child taking its first steps. I glanced at Jerome,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5668",4920,"wondering if this tallied with what he recalled of the Rhamda; and he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"5669",4920,"gave a short nod.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6360",4920,"what I was trying to do. One great service she was rendering has already","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6361",4920,"been made clear: she wore the ring constantly, thus relieving me of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6362",4920,"the anxiety of caring for it. I was very cautious not to have it in my","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6363",4920,"possession for more than a few minutes at a time.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6364",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6365",4920,"My first move was to set down, in orderly fashion, the list of the gem's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6366",4920,"attributes. I grouped together the fluctuating nature of its pale blue","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6367",4920,"colour, its power of reproducing those who had gone into the Blind Spot,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6368",4920,"its combination of perfect solidity with extreme lightness; its quality","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6369",4920,"of coldness to the touch of a male, and warmth to that of a female; and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6370",4920,"finally its ability to induct--I think this is the right term--to induct","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6371",4920,"sounds out of the unknown. This last quality might be called spasmodic","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6372",4920,"or accidental, whereas the others were permanent and constant.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6373",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6374",4920,"Now, to this list I presently was able to add that the gem possessed no","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6375",4920,"radioactive properties that I could detect with the usual means. It was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6376",4920,"only when I began dabbling in chemistry that I learned things.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6377",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6378",4920,"By placing the gem inside a glass bell, and exhausting as much air as","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6379",4920,"possible from around it, the way was cleared for introducing other forms","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6380",4920,"of gases. Whereupon I discovered this:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6381",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6382",4920,"The stone will absorb any given quantity of hydrogen gas.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6383",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6384",4920,"In this respect it behaves analogously to that curious place on","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6385",4920,"the door-frame. Only, it absorbs gas, no liquid; and not any gas,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6386",4920,"either--none but hydrogen.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6387",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6388",4920,"Now, obviously this gem cannot truly absorb so much material, in the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6389",4920,"sense of retaining it as well. The simple test of weighing it afterwards","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6390",4920,"proves this; for its weight remains the same in any circumstances.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6391",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6392",4920,"Moreover, unlike the liquids which I poured into the wood and saw","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6393",4920,"afterwards in the basement, the gas does not escape back into the air. I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6394",4920,"kept it under the Dell long enough to be sure of that. No; that hydrogen","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6395",4920,"is, manifestly, translated into the Blind Spot.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6396",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6397",4920,"Learning nothing further about the gem at that time, I proceeded to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6398",4920,"investigate the trim of the door. I began by trying to find out the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6399",4920,"precise thickness of that liquid-absorbing layer.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6400",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6401",4920,"To do this I scraped off the ""skin"" of the air-darkened wood. This layer","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6402",4920,"was .02 of an inch thick. And--that was the total amount of the active","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6403",4920,"material!","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6404",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6405",4920,"I put these scrapings through a long list of experiments. They told","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6406",4920,"me nothing valuable. I learned only one detail worth mentioning; if a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6407",4920,"fragment of the scrapings be brought near to the Holcomb gem--say, to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6408",4920,"within two inches--the scrapings will burst into flame. It is merely","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6409",4920,"a bright, pinkish flare, like that made by smokeless rifle-powder. No","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6410",4920,"ashes remain. After that we took care not to bring the ring near the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6411",4920,"remaining material on the board.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6412",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6413",4920,"All this occurred on the first day after Ariadne was stricken. Jerome","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6414",4920,"phoned to say that he had engaged the services of a dozen private","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6415",4920,"detectives, and expected to get wind of the Rhamda any hour. Both Dr.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6416",4920,"Hansen and Dr. Higgins called twice, without being able to detect any","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6669",4920,"Immediately it was followed by a steady clicking, such as might be made","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6670",4920,"by gently striking a stick against the pavement; only sharper. This","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6671",4920,"lasted a minute, during which the other sounds ceased.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6672",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6673",4920,"Once more the footsteps. They were not very loud, but in the stillness","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6674",4920,"of that room they all but resounded.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6675",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6676",4920,"Presently Charlotte could stand it no longer. She placed the ring on the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6677",4920,"table, where it continued to emit those unplaceable sounds.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6678",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6679",4920,"""Well! Do--do you people,"" stammered Dr. Malloy, ""do you people all hear","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6680",4920,"THAT?""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6681",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6682",4920,"Miss Clarke's face was rather pale. But her mouth was firm. ""It is","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6683",4920,"nothing,"" said she, with theosophical positiveness. ""You must not","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6684",4920,"believe it--it is not the truth of--""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6685",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6686",4920,"""Pardon me,"" interrupted Sir Henry, ""but this isn't something to argue","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6687",4920,"about! It is a reality; and the sooner we all admit it, the better.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6688",4920,"There is a living creature of some kind making that sound!""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6689",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6690",4920,"""It is the spirit of some two-footed creature,"" asserted Mme. Le Fabre,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6691",4920,"plainly at her ease. She was on familiar ground now. ""If only we had a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6692",4920,"medium!""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6693",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6694",4920,"Abruptly the sounds left the vicinity of the ring. At first we could","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6695",4920,"not locate their new position. Then Herold declared that they came","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6696",4920,"from under the table; and presently we were all gathered on the floor,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6697",4920,"listening to those odd little sounds, while the ring remained thirty","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6698",4920,"inches above, on the top of the table!","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6699",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6700",4920,"It may be that the thing, whatever it was, did not care for such a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6701",4920,"crowd. For shortly the shuffling ceased. And for a while we stared and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6702",4920,"listened, scarcely breathing, trying to locate the new position.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6703",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6704",4920,"Finally we went back to our chairs. We had heard nothing further.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6705",4920,"Nevertheless, we continued to keep silence, with our ears alert for","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6706",4920,"anything more.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6707",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6708",4920,"""Hush!"" whispered Charlotte all of a sudden. ""Did you hear that?"" And","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6709",4920,"she looked up toward the ceiling.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6710",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6711",4920,"In a moment I caught the sound. It was exceedingly faint, like the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6712",4920,"distant thrumming of a zither. Only it was a single note, which did","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6713",4920,"not rise and fall, although there seemed a continual variation in its","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6714",4920,"volume.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6715",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6716",4920,"Unexpectedly the other sounds came again, down under the table. This","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6717",4920,"time we remained in our seats and simply listened. And presently Sir","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6718",4920,"Henry, referring to the ring, made this suggestion:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6719",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6720",4920,"""Suppose we seal it up, and see whether it inducts the sound then as","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6721",4920,"well as when exposed.""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6722",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6723",4920,"This appealed to Herold very strongly; the others were agreeable; so I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6724",4920,"ran upstairs to my room and secured a small screw-top metal canister,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6725",4920,"which I knew to be airtight. It was necessary to remove the stone from","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6726",4920,"the ring, in order to get it into the opening in the can. Presently this","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6727",4920,"was done; and while our invisible visitor continued his scratchy little","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6728",4920,"walking as before, I screwed the top of the can down as tightly as I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6729",4920,"could.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6730",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6731",4920,"Instantly the footsteps halted.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6732",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6733",4920,"I unscrewed the top a trifle. As instantly the stepping was resumed.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6734",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6735",4920,"""Ah!"" cried Herold. ""It's a question of radioactivity, then! Remember Le","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6736",4920,"Bon's experiments, Sir Henry?""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6737",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6738",4920,"But Miss Clarke was sorely mystified by this simple matter, and herself","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6739",4920,"repeated the experiments. Equally puzzled was Mme. Le Fabre. According","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6740",4920,"to her theory, a spirit wouldn't mind a little thing like a metal box.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6741",4920,"Of them all, Dr. Malloy was the least disturbed; so decidedly so that","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6742",4920,"General Hume eyed him quizzically.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6743",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6744",4920,"""Fine bunch of hallucinations, doctor.""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6745",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6746",4920,"""Almost commonplace,"" retorted Malloy.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6747",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6748",4920,"Presently I mentioned that the Rhamda had come from the basement on the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6749",4920,"night that Ariadne had materialised; and I showed that the only possible","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6750",4920,"route into the cellar was through the locked door in the breakfast","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6751",4920,"room, since the windows were all too small, and there was no other door.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6752",4920,"Query: How had the Rhamda got there? Immediately they all became alert.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6753",4920,"As Herold said:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6754",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6755",4920,"""One thing or the other is true; either there is something downstairs","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6756",4920,"which has escaped you, Fenton, or else Avec is able to materialise in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6757",4920,"any place he chooses. Let's look!""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6758",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6759",4920,"We all went down except Charlotte, who went upstairs to stay with","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6760",4920,"Ariadne. By turns, each of us held the ring. And as we unlocked the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6761",4920,"basement door we noted that the invisible, walking creature had reached","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6762",4920,"there before us.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6763",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6764",4920,"Down the steps went those unseen little feet, jumping from one step to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6765",4920,"the next just ahead of us all the way. When within three or four steps","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6766",4920,"of the bottom, the creature made one leap do for them all.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6767",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6768",4920,"I had previously run an extension cord down into the basement, and both","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6769",4920,"compartments could now be lighted by powerful electric lamps. We gave","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6770",4920,"the place a quick examination.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6771",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6772",4920,"""What's all this newly turned earth mean?"" inquired Sir Henry, pointing","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6773",4920,"to the result of Jerome's efforts a few months before. And I explained","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6774",4920,"how he and Harry, on the chance the basement might contain some clue","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6775",4920,"as to the localisation of the Blind Spot, had dug without result in the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6776",4920,"bluish clay.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6777",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6778",4920,"Sir Henry picked up the spade, which had never been moved from where","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6779",4920,"Jerome had dropped it. And while I went on to tell about the pool of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6780",4920,"liquids, which for some unknown reason had not seeped into the soil","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6781",4920,"since forming there, the Englishman proceeded to dig vigorously into the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6782",4920,"heap I had mentioned.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6783",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6784",4920,"The rest of us watched him thoughtfully. We remembered that Jerome's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6785",4920,"digging had been done after Queen's disappearance. And the dog had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6786",4920,"vanished in the rear room, the one in which Chick and Dr. Holcomb had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6787",4920,"last been seen. Now, when Jerome had dug the clay from the basement","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6788",4920,"under this, the dining-room, he had thrown it through the once concealed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6789",4920,"opening in the partition; had thrown the clay, that is, in a small heap","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6790",4920,"under the library. And--after Jerome had done this the phenomena had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6791",4920,"occurred in the library, not in the dining-room.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6792",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6793",4920,"""By Jove!"" ejaculated General Hume, as I pointed this out. ""This may be","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6794",4920,"something more, you know, that mere coincidence!""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6795",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6796",4920,"Sir Henry said nothing, but continued his spading. He paid attention to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6797",4920,"nothing save the heap that Jerome had formed. And with each spadeful he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6798",4920,"bent over and examined the clay very carefully.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6799",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6800",4920,"Miss Clarke and Mme. Le Fabre both remained very calm about it all.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6801",4920,"Each from her own viewpoint regarded the work as more or less a waste of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6802",4920,"time. But I noticed that they did not take their eyes from the spade.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6803",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6804",4920,"Sir Henry stopped to rest. ""Let me,"" offered Herold; and went on as the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6805",4920,"Englishman had done, holding up each spadeful for inspection. And it was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6806",4920,"thus that we made a strange discovery.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6807",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6808",4920,"We all saw it at the same time. Embedded in the bluish earth was a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6809",4920,"small, egg-shaped piece of light-coloured stone. And protruding from its","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6810",4920,"upper surface was a tiny, blood-red pebble, no bigger than a good-sized","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6811",4920,"shot.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6812",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6813",4920,"Herold thrust the point of his spade under the stone, to lift it up.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6814",4920,"Whereupon he gave a queer exclamation.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6815",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6816",4920,"""Well, that's funny!"" holding the stone up in front of us. ""That little","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6817",4920,"thing's as heavy as--as--it's HEAVIER than lead!""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6818",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6819",4920,"Sir Henry picked the stone off the spade. Immediately the material","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6820",4920,"crumbled in his hands, as though rotting, so that it left only the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6821",4920,"small, red pebble intact. Sir Henry weighed this thoughtfully in his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6822",4920,"palm, then without a word handed it around.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6823",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6824",4920,"We all wondered at the pebble. It was most astonishingly heavy. As I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6825",4920,"say, it was no bigger than a fair-sized shot, yet it was vastly heavier.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6826",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6827",4920,"Afterward we weighed it, upstairs, and found that the trifle weighed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6828",4920,"over half a pound. Considering its very small bulk, this worked out to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6829",4920,"be a specific gravity of 192.6 or almost ten times as heavy as the same","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6830",4920,"bulk of pure gold. And gold is heavy.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6831",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6832",4920,"Inevitably we saw that there must be some connection between this","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6833",4920,"unprecedentedly heavy speck of material and that lighter-than-air gem","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6834",4920,"of mystery. For the time being we were careful to keep the two apart. As","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6835",4920,"for the unexplained footsteps, they were still slightly audible, as the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6836",4920,"invisible creatures moved around the cellar.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6837",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6838",4920,"At last we turned to go. I let the others lead the way. Thus I was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6839",4920,"the last to approach the steps; and it was at that moment that I felt","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6840",4920,"something brush against my foot.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6841",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6842",4920,"I stooped down. My hands collided with the thing that had touched me.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6843",4920,"And I found myself clutching--","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6844",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6845",4920,"Something invisible--something which, in that brilliant light, showed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6846",4920,"absolutely nothing to my eyes. But my hands told me I was grasping a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6847",4920,"very real thing, as real as my fingers themselves.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6848",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6849",4920,"I made some sort of incoherent exclamation. The others turned and peered","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6850",4920,"at me.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6851",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6852",4920,"""What is it?"" came Herold's excited voice.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6853",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6854",4920,"""I don't know!"" I gasped. ""Come here.""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6855",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6856",4920,"But Sir Henry was the first to reach me. Next instant he, too, was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6857",4920,"fingering the tiny, unseen object. And such was his iron nerve and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6858",4920,"superior self-control, he identified it almost at once.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6859",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6861",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6862",4920,"Another second and they were all there. I was glad enough of it; for,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6863",4920,"like a flash, with an unexpectedness that startles me even now as I","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6864",4920,"think of it--","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6865",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6866",4920,"The thing became visible. Right in my grasp, a little fluttering bird","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6877",4920,"It was a tiny thing, and most amazingly beautiful. It could not have","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6878",4920,"stood as high as a canary; and had its feathers been made of gleaming","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6879",4920,"silver they could not have been lovelier. And its black-plumed head, and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6880",4920,"long, blossom-like tail, were such as no man on earth ever set eyes on.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6882",4920,"Like a flash it was gone. Not more than a half a second was this","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6883",4920,"enchanting apparition visible to us. Before we could discern any more","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6884",4920,"than I have mentioned, it not only vanished but it ceased to make any","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6885",4920,"sounds whatever. And each of us drew a long breath, as one might after","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6937",4920,"from my friends: Miss Clarke, Mme. Le Fabre, General Hume, Dr. Malloy,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6938",4920,"and Herold. These people are still in the house with me; I think they","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6940",4920,"credit to myself for what I have found out. The others supplied most of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6955",4920,"some distance away from where I sat. No ill effects when I ventured into","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"6960",4920,"Malloy. The lead bracelets were Mme. Le Fabre's suggestion; they","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"6961",4920,"work fine. Sir Henry was the one who pointed out the advantage of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"7047",4920,"weighing in the retrospect. They know just where they are going.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7048",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7049",4920,"The coming of Chick Watson brought new perspective. Hitherto we had been","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7050",4920,"looking into the darkness. Whatever had been caught in the focus of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7051",4920,"Spot had become lost to our five senses.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7052",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7053",4920,"Yet, facts are facts. It was no mere trickery that had caught Dr.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7054",4920,"Holcomb in the beginning. One by one, men of the highest standards and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"7056",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7057",4920,"So the coming of Watson may well be set down as one of the deciding","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7058",4920,"moments of history. He who had been the victim a year before was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7059",4920,"returning through the very Spot that had engulfed him. He was the herald","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"7065",4920,"talked with him on that memorable night in the cafe. Well he remembered","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7066",4920,"the incident, and the subject of that strange conversation--the secret","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7067",4920,"of life that had been discovered by the missing Dr. Holcomb. And Dr.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"7080",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7081",4920,"But he did not see them at first. He groped about blindly, moving slowly","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"7598",4920,"The first thing was light and a sense of great pain. There was a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7599",4920,"pressure at the back of the eyeballs, a poignant sensation not unlike","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"7603",4920,"The abrupt return of consciousness in such a condition is not easy to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7604",4920,"imagine. After all he had gone through, this strange sequel must have","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7605",4920,"been terribly puzzling to him. He was a man of good education, well","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7606",4920,"versed in psychology; in the first rush of consciousness he tried, as","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7607",4920,"best he could, to weigh himself up in the balance of aberration. And it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7608",4920,"was this very fact that gave him his reassurance; for it told him that","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7609",4920,"he could think, could reason, could count on a mind in full function.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7610",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7611",4920,"But he could not see. The pain in his eyeballs was blinding. There was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7612",4920,"nothing he could distinguish; everything was woven together, a mere","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7613",4920,"blaze of wonderful, iridescent, blazing coloration.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7614",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7615",4920,"But if he could not see, he could feel. The pain was excruciating.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7616",4920,"He closed his eyes and fell to thinking, curiously enough, that the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7617",4920,"experience was similar to what he had gone through when upon learning to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7618",4920,"swim, he had first opened his eyes under the water. It had been under","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7619",4920,"a blazing sun. The pain and the colour--it was much the same, only","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7620",4920,"intensified.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7621",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7622",4920,"Then he knew that he was very tired. The mere effort of that one thought","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7623",4920,"had cost him vitality. He dropped back into unconsciousness, such as","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7624",4920,"was more insensibility than slumber. He had strange dreams, of people","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7625",4920,"walking, of women, and of many voices. It was blurred and indistinct,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7626",4920,"yet somehow not unreal. Then, after an unguessable length of time--he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7627",4920,"awoke.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7628",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7629",4920,"He was much stronger. The lapse may have been very long; he could not","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7630",4920,"know. But the pain in his eyes was gone; and he ventured to open the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7631",4920,"lids again in the face of the light that had been so baffling. This time","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7632",4920,"he could see; not distinctly, but still enough to assure him of reality.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7633",4920,"By closing his eyes at intervals he was able to rest them and to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7634",4920,"accustom them gradually to the new degree of light. And after a bit he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7635",4920,"could see plainly.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7636",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7637",4920,"He was on a cot, and in a room almost totally different from any that","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7638",4920,"he had ever seen before. The colour of the walls, even, was dissimilar;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7639",4920,"likewise the ceiling. It was white, in a way, and yet unlike it; neither","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7640",4920,"did it resemble any of the various tints; to give it a name that he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7641",4920,"afterward learned--alna--implies but little. It was utterly new to him.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7642",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7643",4920,"Apparently he was alone. The room was not large; about the size of an","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7644",4920,"ordinary bedroom. And after the first novelty of the unplaceable colour","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7645",4920,"had worn off he began to take stock of his own person.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7646",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7647",4920,"First, he was covered by the finest of bed clothing, thick but","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7648",4920,"exceedingly light. There was no counterpane, but two blankets and two","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7649",4920,"sheets; and none of them corresponded to any colour or material he had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7650",4920,"ever known. He only knew that their tints were light rather than dark.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7651",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7652",4920,"Next, he moved his hands out from under the coverings, and held them up","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7653",4920,"before his eyes. He was immensely puzzled. He naturally expected to see","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7654",4920,"the worn, emaciated hands which had been his on that dramatic night; but","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7655",4920,"the ones before him were plump, normal, of a healthy pink. The wrists","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7656",4920,"likewise were in perfect condition, also his arms. He could not account","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7657",4920,"for this sudden return to health, of the vigour he had known before he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7658",4920,"began to wear the ring. He lay back pondering.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7659",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7660",4920,"Presently he fell to examining his clothes. There were two garments made","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7661",4920,"of a silk-like textile, rather heavy as to weight, but exceedingly soft","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7662",4920,"as to touch. They were slightly darker than the bed clothing. In a way","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7663",4920,"they were much like pyjamas, except that both were designed to be merely","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7664",4920,"slipped into place, without buttons or draw-strings. That is, they were","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7665",4920,"tailored to fit snugly over the shoulders and waist, while loose enough","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7666",4920,"elsewhere.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7667",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7668",4920,"Then he noticed the walls of the room. They were after a simple,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7669",4920,"symmetrical style; coved--to use an architectural expression--or curved,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7670",4920,"where the corner would come with a radius much larger than common,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7671",4920,"amounting to four or five feet; so that a person of ordinary height","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7672",4920,"could not stand close to the wall without stooping. Where the coved","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7673",4920,"portion flowed into the perpendicular of the wall there was a broad","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7674",4920,"moulding, like a plate rail, which acted as a support for the hanging","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7675",4920,"pictures.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7676",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7677",4920,"Watson counted four of these pictures. Instinctively he felt that they","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7678",4920,"might give him a valuable clue as to his whereabouts. For, while his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7679",4920,"mind had cleared enough for him to feel sure that he had truly come","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7680",4920,"through the Spot, he knew nothing more. Where was he? What would the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7681",4920,"pictures tell?","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7682",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7683",4920,"The first was directly before his eyes. In size perhaps two by three","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7684",4920,"feet, with its greater length horizontal, it was more of a landscape","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7685",4920,"than a portrait. And Watson's eagerness for the subject itself made him","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7686",4920,"forget to note whether the work was mechanically or manually executed.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7687",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7688",4920,"For it revealed a girl--about ten or twelve--very slightly draped,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7689",4920,"enjoying a wild romp with a most extraordinary creature. It was this","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7690",4920,"animal that made the picture amazing; there was no subtle significance","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7691",4920,"in the scene--there was nothing remarkable about the technique. The","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7692",4920,"whole interest, for Watson, was in the animal.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7693",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7694",4920,"It was a deer; perfect and beautiful, but cast in a Lilliputian mould.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7695",4920,"It stood barely a foot high, the most delicate thing he had ever looked","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7696",4920,"upon. Mature in every detail of its proportion, the dainty hoofs, the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7697",4920,"fragile legs, smooth-coated body, and small, wide-antlered head--a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7698",4920,"miniature eight-pointer--made such a vision as might come to the dreams","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7699",4920,"of a hunter.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7700",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7701",4920,"Chick rose up in bed, in order to examine it more closely. Immediately","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7702",4920,"he fell back again slightly dizzy. He closed his eyes.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7703",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7704",4920,"Shortly he began examining the other pictures. Two of these were","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7705",4920,"simple flower studies. Watson scarcely knew which puzzled him most; the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7706",4920,"blossoms or their containers. For the vases were like large-sized loving","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7707",4920,"cups, broad as to body, and provided with a handle on either side. Their","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7708",4920,"colours were unfamiliar. As for the blossoms--in one study the blooms","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7709",4920,"were a half-dozen in number, and more like Shasta daisies than anything","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7710",4920,"else. But their colour was totally unlike, while they possessed wide,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7711",4920,"striped stamens that gave the flowers an identity all their own. In","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7712",4920,"the other vase were several varieties, and every one absolutely","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7713",4920,"unrecognisable.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7714",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7715",4920,"On the opposite side of the room was something fairly familiar. At","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7716",4920,"first glance it seemed a simple basket of kittens, done in black and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7717",4920,"white--something like crayon, and yet resembling sepia. Alongside the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7718",4920,"basket, however, was a spoon, one end resting on the edge of a saucer.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7719",4920,"And it was the size of the spoon that commanded Chick's attention;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7720",4920,"rather, the size of the kittens, any one of which could have curled up","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7721",4920,"comfortably in the bowl of the spoon! Judging relatively, if it were an","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7722",4920,"ordinary tablespoon, then the kittens were smaller than the smallest of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7723",4920,"mice.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7724",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7725",4920,"Chick gave it up. Presently he began speculating about the time. He","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7726",4920,"decided that, whatever the hour might be, it was still daylight. In one","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7727",4920,"wall of the room was a large, oval window, of a material which may as","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7728",4920,"well be called glass, frosted, so as to permit no view of what might lie","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7729",4920,"outside. But it allowed plenty of light to enter.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7730",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7731",4920,"Cut in the opposite wall was a doorway, hung with a curtain instead of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7732",4920,"a door. This curtain was a gauzy material, but its maroonlike shade","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7733",4920,"completely hid all view of whatever lay beyond.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7734",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7735",4920,"Chick waited and listened. Hitherto he had not heard a sound. There was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7736",4920,"not even that subtle, mixed hum from the distance that we are accustomed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7737",4920,"to associate with silence. He felt certain that he was inside the Blind","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7738",4920,"Spot; but as to just where that locality might lie, he knew as little","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7739",4920,"as before. He knew only that he in a building of some sort. Where, and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7740",4920,"what, was the building?","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7741",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7742",4920,"Just then he noticed a cord dangling from the ceiling. It came down to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7743",4920,"within six inches of his head. He gave it a pull.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7744",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7745",4920,"Whereupon he heard a faint, musical jangling in the distance. He tried","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7746",4920,"to analyse the sound. It was not bell-like; perhaps the word ""tinkling""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7747",4920,"would serve better. Provisionally, Chick placed the key at middle D.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7748",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7749",4920,"A moment later he heard steps outside the curtain. They were very soft","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7750",4920,"and light and deliberate; and almost at the same instant a delicate","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7751",4920,"white hand moved the curtain aside.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7752",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7753",4920,"It was a woman. Chick lay back and wondered. Although not beautiful she","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7754",4920,"was very good to look at, with large blue eyes of a deep tenderness and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7755",4920,"sympathy, even features, and a wonderful fold of rich brown hair held in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7756",4920,"place by a satiny net.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7757",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7758",4920,"She started when she saw Chick's wide open eyes; then smiled, a motherly","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7759",4920,"smile and compassionate. She was dressed in a manner at once becoming","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7760",4920,"and odd, to one unaccustomed, in a gown that draped the entire figure,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7761",4920,"yet left the right arm and shoulder bare. Chick noticed that arm","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7762",4920,"especially; it was white as marble, moulded full, and laced with fine","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7763",4920,"blue veins. He had never seen an arm like that. Nor such a woman. She","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7764",4920,"might have been forty.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7765",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7766",4920,"She came over to the bed and placed a hand on Chick's forehead. Again","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7767",4920,"she smiled, and nodded.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7768",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"7772",4920,"although she did not speak English, yet he could understand her quite","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"7773",4920,"well. At the moment it seemed perfectly obvious; afterward, the fact","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10397",4920,"need not be said, presented somewhat different aspects from what is","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10398",4920,"known on the earth.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10399",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10400",4920,"It seemed that the Jarados had come miraculously. That is, he had come","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10403",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10405",4920,"love, virtue, and the higher ethics such as are inherent in all great","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10406",4920,"philosophies. But he did not call himself a religionist. That was the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10407",4920,"queer point. He said that he had come to teach an advanced philosophy of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10408",4920,"life; and he expressly stated that his teachings were absolute only to a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10414",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10415",4920,"But on some points he was adamant. He had arrived at a time when the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10416",4920,"unthinking, self-glorifying Thomahlians had all but exterminated the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10417",4920,"lower orders of creation. The Jarados sought to remove the handicap","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10418",4920,"which the people had set upon themselves, and gave them, in the place","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10419",4920,"of kindness which they had forgotten, how to use, a burning desire for","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10420",4920,"a positive knowledge, where before had been only blind faith. Also, he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10421",4920,"taught good-fellowship, as a means to this end. He taught beauty, love,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10422",4920,"and laughter, the three great cleansers of humanity. And yet, through it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10424",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10425",4920,"The Jarados was a mystic.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10426",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10427",4920,"He studied life after a manner of his own. He was a stickler for getting","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10428",4920,"down to the very heart of things, for prodding around among causes until","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10429",4920,"he found the cause itself. And thus he learned the secret of the occult.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10430",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10431",4920,"For so he taught. And presently the Jarados was recognized as an","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10432",4920,"authority on what the Thomahlia called ""the next world."" Only he showed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10433",4920,"that death, instead of being an ushering into a void, was merely a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10434",4920,"translation onto another plane of life, a higher plane and a more","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10435",4920,"glorious one. In short, a thing to be desired and attained, not to be","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10436",4920,"avoided.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10437",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10438",4920,"This put the Spot of Life on an entirely different basis. No longer","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10439",4920,"was it a fearsome thing. The Jarados elevated death to the plane of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10440",4920,"motherhood--something to glory in. And Chick gathered that his famous","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10441",4920,"prophecy--which he had yet to read, where it hung on the wall of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10442",4920,"temple--gave every detail of the Jarados' profound convictions and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10443",4920,"teachings regarding the mystery of the next life.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10444",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10445",4920,"And now comes a curious thing. As Chick read these details, he became","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10446",4920,"more and more conscious of--what shall it be called?--the presence of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10447",4920,"someone or something beside him, above and all about him, watching his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10448",4920,"every movement. He could not get away from the feeling, although it was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10449",4920,"broad daylight, and he was seemingly quite alone in the room. Chick was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10450",4920,"not frightened; but he could have sworn that a very real personality was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10451",4920,"enveloping his own as he read.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10452",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10453",4920,"Every word, somehow, reminded him of the miraculous sequence of facts","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10454",4920,"as he knew them; the unerring accuracy with which he, quite unthinkingly","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10455",4920,"and almost without volition, had solved problem after problem, although","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10456",4920,"the chances were totally against him. He became more and more convinced","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10457",4920,"that he himself had practically no control over his affairs; that he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10458",4920,"was in the hands of an irresistible Fate; and that--he could not help","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10459",4920,"it--his good angel was none other than the prophet who, almost ninety","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10460",4920,"centuries ago, had lived and taught upon the Thomahlia, and in the end","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10461",4920,"had returned to the unknown.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10462",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10463",4920,"But how could such a thing be? Watson did not even know where he was!","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10464",4920,"Small wonder that, again and again, he felt the need of assurance. He","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10802",4920,"not supported by the foundation, but rather the reverse--the floor was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10803",4920,"suspended from the ceiling. It was the work of the Titans--so high","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10804",4920,"and stupendous that at the first instant Watson felt numb with","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10805",4920,"insignificance. What chance had he against men of such colossal","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10806",4920,"conception.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10807",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10808",4920,"How large the building was he could not see. The Gargantuan facade","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10809",4920,"itself was enough to smother comprehension. It was laid out in the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10810",4920,"form of a triangle, one end of which was open towards the city; the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10811",4920,"two sections of the facade met under a huge, arched opening--the door","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10812",4920,"itself. Watson recognised the structure as the one he had seen from","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10813",4920,"the June Bug on the outskirts of the Mahovisal. The enormous plaza was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10814",4920,"packed with people, leaving only a narrow lane for the procession; and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10815",4920,"as far back as Chick could see crowds in the streets converged towards","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10816",4920,"this vast space. Their numbers were incalculable.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10817",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10818",4920,"The car stopped. The guards, both crimson and blue, formed a twenty-fold","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10819",4920,"cordon. Watson could feel the suspended breath of the waiting multitude.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10820",4920,"The three men stepped out--the Geos first, then the Jan Lucar, and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10821",4920,"Watson last. Chick caught the Lucar's eye; it was confident; the man was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10822",4920,"springing with vigour, jovial in spite of the moment.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10823",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10824",4920,"They passed between two of the huge pillars, and under the giant arch.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10825",4920,"For a few minutes they walked through what seemed, to Chick, a perfect","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10826",4920,"maze of those titanic columns. And every foot was marked by the lines of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10827",4920,"crimson and blue, flanking either side.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10828",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10829",4920,"An immense sea of people rose high into the forest of pillars as far as","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10830",4920,"his eye could reach. He had never been in such a concourse of humanity.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10831",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10832",4920,"They passed through an inner arch, a smaller and lower one, into what","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10833",4920,"Chick guessed was the temple proper. And if Chick had thought the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10834",4920,"anteroom stupendous, he saw that a new word, one which went beyond all","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10835",4920,"previous experience, was needed to describe what he now saw.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10836",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10837",4920,"It was almost too immense to be grasped in its entirety. Gone was the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10838",4920,"maze of columns; instead, far, far away to the right and to the left,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10839",4920,"stood single rows of herculean pillars. There were but seven on a side,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10840",4920,"separated by great distances; and between them stretched a space so","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10841",4920,"immense, so incredibly vast, that a small city could have been housed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10842",4920,"within it. And over it all was not the open sky, but a ceiling of such","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10843",4920,"terrific grandeur that Chick almost halted the procession while he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10844",4920,"gazed.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10845",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10846",4920,"For that ceiling was the under side of a cloud, a grey-black, forbidding","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10847",4920,"thundercloud. And the fourteen pillars, seven on either side, were","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10848",4920,"prodigious waterspouts, monster spirals of the hue of storm, with","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10849",4920,"flaring sweeps at top and bottom that welded roof and floor into one","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10850",4920,"terrific whole. Sheer from side to side stretched that portentous level","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10851",4920,"cloud; it was a span of an epoch; and on either side it was rooted in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10852",4920,"those awful columns, seemingly alive, as though ready at any instant to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10853",4920,"suck up the earth into the infinite.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10854",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10855",4920,"By downright will-power Watson tore his attention away and directed it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10856",4920,"upon the other features of that unprecedented interior. It was lighted,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10857",4920,"apparently, by great windows behind the fourteen pillars; windows","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10858",4920,"too far to be distinguishable. And the light revealed, directly ahead","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10859",4920,"something that Chick at first thought to be a cascade of black water.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10860",4920,"It leaped out of the rear wall of the temple, and at its crest it","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10861",4920,"was bordered with walls of solid silver, cut across and designed with","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10862",4920,"scrolls of gold and gem work; walls that swooped down and ended with two","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10863",4920,"huge green columns at the base of that fantastic fall.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10864",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10865",4920,"As they approached a swarm of tiny bronze objects, silver winged,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10866",4920,"fluttered out through the temple--tiny birds, smaller than swallows,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10867",4920,"beautiful and swift-winged, elusive. They were without number; in a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10868",4920,"moment the air of the temple was alive with flitting, darting spots of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10869",4920,"glinting colour.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10870",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10871",4920,"Then Chick saw that there were two people sitting high on the crest","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10872",4920,"of that cascade. Wondering, Chick and the rest marched on through the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10873",4920,"silent crowd; all standing with bared heads and bated breaths. The","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10874",4920,"worshipping Thomahlians filled every inch of that enormous place. Only","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10875",4920,"a narrow lane permitted the procession to pass towards that puzzling,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10876",4920,"silent, black waterfall.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10877",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10878",4920,"They were almost at its base when Chick saw the vanguard of the Rhamdas","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10879",4920,"unhesitatingly stride straight against the torrent, and then mount upon","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10880",4920,"it. Up they marched; and Chick knew that the black water was black jade,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10881",4920,"and that the two people at its crest were seated upon a landing at the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10882",4920,"top of the grandest stairway he had ever seen.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10883",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10884",4920,"Up went the Rhamdas deploying to right and left against the silver","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10885",4920,"walls. The crimson and blue uniformed guards remained behind, lining","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10886",4920,"the lane through the throng. At the foot of the steps Chick stopped and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10887",4920,"looked around, and again he felt numb at the sheer vastness of it all.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10888",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10889",4920,"For he was looking back now at the portal through which the procession","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10890",4920,"had marched; a portal now closed; and above it, covering a great expanse","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10891",4920,"of that wall and extending up almost into the brooding cloud above, was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10892",4920,"spread a mighty replica of the tri-coloured Sign of the Jarados.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10893",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10894",4920,"For the first time Chick felt the full significance of symbolism.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10895",4920,"Whereas before it had been but an incident of adventure, now it was the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10896",4920,"symbol of mystic revelation. It was not only the motif for all other","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10897",4920,"decoration upon the walls and minor elements of the temple; it was the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10898",4920,"emblem of the trinity, deep, holy, significant of the mystery of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10899",4920,"the universe and the hereafter. There was something deeper than mere","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10900",4920,"fatalism; behind all was the fact-rooted faith of a civilisation.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10901",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10902",4920,"But at that moment, as Chick paused with one foot on the bottom step of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10903",4920,"the flight, something happened that sent quivers of joy and confidence","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10904",4920,"all through him. Someone was talking--talking in English!","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10905",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10906",4920,"Chick looked. The speaker was a man in the blue garb of the Senestro's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10907",4920,"guard. He was standing at the end of the line nearest the stair, and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10908",4920,"slightly in front of his fellows. Like the rest, he was holding his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10909",4920,"weapon, a black, needled-pointed sword, at the salute. Chick gave him","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10910",4920,"only a glance, then had the presence of mind to look elsewhere as a man","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10911",4920,"said, in a low, guarded voice:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10912",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10913",4920,"""Y' air right, me lad; don't look at me. I know what ye're thinkin'. But","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10914",4920,"she ain't as bad as she looks! Keep yer heart clear; never fear. You an'","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10915",4920,"me can lick all Thomahlia! Go straight up them stairs, an' stand that","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10916",4920,"blackguard Senestro on his 'ead, just like y'd do in Frisco!""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10917",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10918",4920,"""Who are you?"" asked Watson, intent upon the great three-leafed clover.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10919",4920,"He used the same low, cautious tone the other had employed. ""Who are","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10920",4920,"you, friend?""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10921",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10922",4920,"""Pat MacPherson, of course,"" was the answer. ""An' Oi've said a plenty.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10923",4920,"Now, go aboot your business.""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10924",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10925",4920,"Watson did not quibble. There was no time to learn more. He did not wish","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10926",4920,"it to be noticed; yet he could not hide it from the Jan Lucar and the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10927",4920,"Rhamda Geos, who were still at his side. They had heard that tongue","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10928",4920,"before. The looks they exchanged told, however, that they were gratified","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10929",4920,"rather than displeased by the interruption. Certainly all feelings of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10930",4920,"depression left Chick, and he ascended the stairs with a glad heart and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10931",4920,"a resilient stride that could not but be noticed.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10932",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10943",4920,"Reaching the top of the jade steps, Chick found the landing to be a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10944",4920,"great dais, nearly a hundred feet across. On the right and left this","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10945",4920,"dais was hedged in by the silver walls, on each of which was hung a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10946",4920,"huge, golden scrollwork. These scrolls bore legends, which for the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10947",4920,"moment Chick ignored. At the rear of the dais was a large object like a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10948",4920,"bronze bell.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10949",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10950",4920,"The floor was of the usual mosaic, except in the centre, where there","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10951",4920,"was a plain, circular design. Chick took careful note of this, a circle","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10952",4920,"about twenty feet across, as white and unbroken as a bed of frozen snow.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10953",4920,"Whether it was stone or not he could not determine. All around its edge","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10954",4920,"was a gap that separated it from the dais, a gap several inches across.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10955",4920,"Chick turned to Geos:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10959",4920,"""Even so. It is the strangest thing in all the Thomahlia, my lord. Can","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10961",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10962",4920,"For Watson had reached out with his toe and touched the white surface.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10963",4920,"He drew it back suddenly.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10964",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10965",4920,"""It has a feeling,"" he replied, ""that I cannot describe. It is cold, and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10969",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10970",4920,"What the Rhamda meant by that Chick could not tell. He was interested","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10971",4920,"in the odd white substance. It was as smooth as glass, although at","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10972",4920,"intervals there were faint, almost imperceptible, dark lines, like the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10973",4920,"finest scratches in old ivory. Yet the whiteness was not dazzling. Again","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10974",4920,"Watson touched it with his foot, and noted the inexplicable feeling of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10975",4920,"exhilaration. In the moment of absorption he quite forgot the concourse","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10976",4920,"about him. He knew that he was now standing on the crux of the Blind","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"10981",4920,"a small throne-like chair of some translucent green material. On the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10982",4920,"right sat the Bar Senestro, in a chair differing only in that its colour","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10983",4920,"was a bright blue. In the centre of the dais stood a third chair--a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10984",4920,"crimson one--empty.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10985",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10986",4920,"The Senestro stood up. He was royally clad, his breast gleaming with","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10987",4920,"jewels. He was certainly handsome; he had the carriage of confident","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"10988",4920,"royalty. There was no fear in this man, no uncertainty, no weakness.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11189",4920,"opponent turn slowly about, and in the next split second he was spinning","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11210",4920,"himself by a new hold. The struggle became a blur--muscle, legs, the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11689",4920,"""For a purpose known only to the Jarados, my lord. There are only two of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11692",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11693",4920,"Wondering, Chick helped the Aradna don her garment and then slipped","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11694",4920,"into his own. Nevertheless, he pinned more faith in the automatic in his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11695",4920,"pocket. He did not make use of the hood which was intended to cover his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11697",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11698",4920,"""Pardon me,"" spoke the queen. She reached over and extended the hood","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11701",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11702",4920,"Chick obeyed with only an inward demur. What puzzled him most was the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11703",4920,"isolation. Seemingly they were quite alone; there was nothing, no one,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11704",4920,"to oppose them.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11705",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11706",4920,"But he had merely taken something for granted. He, being from the earth,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11707",4920,"had assumed that strife meant noise. It was only when the Aradna caught","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11708",4920,"him by the arm, and whispered for him to listen, that he understood.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11709",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11710",4920,"It was like a breeze, that sound. To be more precise, it was like the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11711",4920,"heavy passage of breath, almost uninterrupted, coming from all about","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11712",4920,"them. And presently Chick caught a queer odour.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11713",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11714",4920,"""What is it?"" he breathed in the Aradna's ear.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11719",4920,"a battle which was fought with noiseless and terribly efficient","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11720",4920,"weapons--so efficient that there were no wounded to give voice to pain.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11721",4920,"Before he could ask a question a familiar voice sounded out of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11746",4920,"Chick did not answer--he had heard a low command from the Geos. Next","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11747",4920,"instant the space before them was illuminated by clear white light, in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11748",4920,"the form of a circle--bright as day. In the centre shimmered an object","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11749",4920,"like a mist of blue flame, a nimbus of dazzling, actinic lightning.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11750",4920,"There was no sign of man or life, no suggestion of sound--nothing but","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11751",4920,"the nimbus, and the brilliant space about it. The whole phenomenon","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11758",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11759",4920,"He did not finish. A red line of soldiers had rushed straight out of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11760",4920,"blackness into the circle of light. It seemed that they were charging","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11761",4920,"the nimbus. They were stooping now, discharging their queer weapons;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11762",4920,"about three hundred of them--an inspiring sight. They charged in","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11763",4920,"determined silence.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11764",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11765",4920,"Then--Watson blinked. The line disappeared; the thing was like a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11766",4920,"miracle. It took time for Chick to realise that he was looking upon","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11767",4920,"the ""pink death"" MacPherson had warned him against--the work of the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11768",4920,"deherers, whatever the word meant. For where had been a column of","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11769",4920,"gallant guards there was now only a broad stream of pink liquid","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11770",4920,"trickling over the ground. It was annihilation itself--too quick to","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11771",4920,"be horrible--inexorable and instantaneous. Chick involuntarily placed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11772",4920,"himself in front of the Aradna.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11785",4920,"Watson waited. He knew enough now to cling to the shadow, there with","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11786",4920,"MacPherson, the Geos, and the Aradna. In the centre of the great","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11787",4920,"light-circle the nimbus of blue stood out like a vibrating haze, while","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11788",4920,"all about, in the darkness, could be heard the weird sound made by the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11795",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11796",4920,"For the nimbus had suddenly dissolved, and in its place there appeared","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11797",4920,"one of the quaintest, yet most beautiful buildings that Watson had ever","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11798",4920,"seen. It was a three-cornered structure, low-set, and of unspeakably","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11799",4920,"dazzling magnificence; a building carved and chiselled from solid","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11800",4920,"carbon. Chick momentarily forgot the doctor.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11801",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11802",4920,"In front of it stood a line of Blue Guards, headed by the Senestro.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11803",4920,"Their confusion showed that something altogether unexpected had","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11804",4920,"happened. They were ducking here and there, seemingly bewildered by the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11805",4920,"sudden vanishing of that protecting blue dazzle. The Senestro was trying","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11806",4920,"to restore order; and in a moment he succeeded. He led the way toward a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11807",4920,"low, triangular platform, at the entrance--a single white door--to the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11808",4920,"palace.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11809",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11810",4920,"Pat MacPherson's automatic flashed and barked. Next instant Watson","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11811",4920,"was in action. The Bar next to the Senestro staggered, then collapsed","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11812",4920,"against his chieftain. Another rolled against his feet, causing him","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11813",4920,"to stumble; an act that probably saved his life, for the platform in a","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11814",4920,"second was covered with writhing, bleeding, dying Bars.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11815",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11816",4920,"The Senestro managed to reach the doorway. MacPherson cursed.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11817",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11818",4920,"""Come on!"" he yelled to Watson. ""Well git him alive!"" Watson remembered","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11819",4920,"little of that rush. There stood the great Bar at the doorway,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11820",4920,"surrounded by his dying and panic-stricken men. The cloak given Chick by","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11821",4920,"the Geos impeded his progress; with a quick movement he threw it off and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11822",4920,"ran unprotected alongside the Irishman. The Blue guards saw them coming;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11823",4920,"they levelled their weapons. But before they could discharge them they","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11824",4920,"met the same fate as had the Reds. A tremor in the air, and they were","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11825",4920,"gone, leaving only a pink pool on the ground.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11826",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11827",4920,"Senestro alone remained untouched. He was about to open the white door;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11828",4920,"for a second he posed, defiant and handsome. Then the great Bar ducked","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11829",4920,"swiftly and almost with the same motion dodged into the building. Chick","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11830",4920,"and Pat were right after him.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11831",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11832",4920,"Inside was darkness. Chick ran head on against the side wall; turning,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11833",4920,"he bumped into another. The sudden transition from brilliance","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11834",4920,"to blackness was overwhelming. He stopped and felt about","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11835",4920,"carefully--momentarily blind. What if the Senestro found him now?","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11836",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11837",4920,"He called MacPherson's name. There was no reply. He tried to feel his","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11838",4920,"way along, finding the wall irregular, jagged, sharp cornered. But the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11839",4920,"way must lead somewhere. He reached a turn in the passage; it was","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11840",4920,"still too dark for him to see anything. He proceeded more cautiously,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11841",4920,"wondering at those craggy walls. And then--","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11842",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11843",4920,"Chick slapped his hands to his eyes. It was as if he had been shot into","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11844",4920,"the core of the sun--the obsidian darkness flashed into light--a light","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11845",4920,"beyond all enduring. Chick staggered, and cried in pain. And yet, reason","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11846",4920,"told him just what it was, just what had happened. It was the carbon; he","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11847",4920,"was in the heart of the diamond; the Senestro had led him on and on, and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11848",4920,"then--had flashed some intense light upon the vast jewel. Watson knew","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11849",4920,"the terrible helplessness of the blind. His end had come!","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11850",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11851",4920,"And so it seemed. Next instant someone came up to him--someone he could","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11852",4920,"hear if he could not see. It was the Senestro.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11853",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11854",4920,"""Hail, Sir Phantom! Pardon my abrupt manner of welcome. I suppose you","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11855",4920,"have come for the Jarados?"" And he laughed, a laugh full of mockery and","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11856",4920,"triumph. ""Perhaps you think I intend to kill you?""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11857",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11858",4920,"Watson said no word. He had been outwitted. He awaited the end. But the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11859",4920,"Senestro saw fit to say, with an irony that told how sure he was:","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11860",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11861",4920,"""However, I am opposed to killing in cold blood. Open your eyes, Sir","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"

"11864",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11865",4920,"Watson slowly opened his eyes. The blinding light had dimmed to a soft","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11866",4920,"glow. They were in a sort of gallery whose length was uncertain;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11867",4920,"between him and the outlet, about ten feet away, stood the confident,","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11868",4920,"ever-smiling Bar.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11869",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11870",4920,"""You or I,"" said he, jauntily. ""Are you ready to try it? I have given","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11871",4920,"you a fair chance!""","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11872",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11873",4920,"He raised his dagger-like weapon, as though aiming it. At the same","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11874",4920,"instant Chick pulled the trigger from the hip, snap aim.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11875",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11876",4920,"The gun was empty.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11877",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11878",4920,"Another second, and Watson would have been like those spots of colour","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11879",4920,"on the ground outside. He breathed a prayer to his Maker. The Senestro's","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11880",4920,"weapon was in line with his throat.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11881",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11882",4920,"But it was not to be. There came a flash and a stunning report; the","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11883",4920,"deherer clattered against the wall, and the Senestro clutched a stinging","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11884",4920,"hand. He was staring in surprise at something behind Chick--something","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11885",4920,"that made him turn and dart out of sight.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11886",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11887",4920,"Chick wheeled.","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11888",4920,"","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11889",4920,"Right behind him stood the familiar form of the Jan Lucar; and a few","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
"11890",4920,"feet beyond, a figure from which came a clear, cool, nonchalant voice;","The Blind Spot",NA,"Science Fiction","en"
