"60",545,"I came upon him quite suddenly, and no less unexpectedly, upon the rim","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"61",545,"of the great Sahara Desert.  He was standing before a goat-skin tent","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"62",545,"amidst a clump of date palms within a tiny oasis.  Close by was an Arab","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"67",545,"approached the little clump of verdure I saw the man come from his tent","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"100",545,"I was born in Connecticut about thirty years ago.  My name is David","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"101",545,"Innes.  My father was a wealthy mine owner.  When I was nineteen he","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"102",545,"died.  All his property was to be mine when I had attained my","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"103",545,"majority--provided that I had devoted the two years intervening in","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"104",545,"close application to the great business I was to inherit.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"105",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"106",545,"I did my best to fulfil the last wishes of my parent--not because of","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"107",545,"the inheritance, but because I loved and honored my father.  For six","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"108",545,"months I toiled in the mines and in the counting-rooms, for I wished to","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"109",545,"know every minute detail of the business.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"110",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"111",545,"Then Perry interested me in his invention.  He was an old fellow who","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"112",545,"had devoted the better part of a long life to the perfection of a","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"113",545,"mechanical subterranean prospector.  As relaxation he studied","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"114",545,"paleontology.  I looked over his plans, listened to his arguments,","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"115",545,"inspected his working model--and then, convinced, I advanced the funds","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"116",545,"necessary to construct a full-sized, practical prospector.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"117",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"118",545,"I shall not go into the details of its construction--it lies out there","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"119",545,"in the desert now--about two miles from here.  Tomorrow you may care to","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"120",545,"ride out and see it.  Roughly, it is a steel cylinder a hundred feet","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"121",545,"long, and jointed so that it may turn and twist through solid rock if","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"122",545,"need be.  At one end is a mighty revolving drill operated by an engine","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"123",545,"which Perry said generated more power to the cubic inch than any other","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"124",545,"engine did to the cubic foot.  I remember that he used to claim that","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"125",545,"that invention alone would make us fabulously wealthy--we were going to","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"126",545,"make the whole thing public after the successful issue of our first","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"127",545,"secret trial--but Perry never returned from that trial trip, and I only","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"128",545,"after ten years.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"129",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"130",545,"I recall as it were but yesterday the night of that momentous occasion","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"131",545,"upon which we were to test the practicality of that wondrous invention.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"132",545,"It was near midnight when we repaired to the lofty tower in which Perry","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"133",545,"had constructed his ""iron mole"" as he was wont to call the thing.  The","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"134",545,"great nose rested upon the bare earth of the floor.  We passed through","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"135",545,"the doors into the outer jacket, secured them, and then passing on into","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"140",545,"life-giving chemicals with which he was to manufacture fresh air to","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"141",545,"replace that which we consumed in breathing; to his instruments for","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"142",545,"recording temperatures, speed, distance, and for examining the","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"144",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"145",545,"He tested the steering device, and overlooked the mighty cogs which","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"146",545,"transmitted its marvelous velocity to the giant drill at the nose of","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"148",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"149",545,"Our seats, into which we strapped ourselves, were so arranged upon","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"151",545,"ploughing her way downward into the bowels of the earth, or running","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"152",545,"horizontally along some great seam of coal, or rising vertically toward","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"153",545,"the surface again.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"154",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"155",545,"At length all was ready.  Perry bowed his head in prayer.  For a moment","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"156",545,"we were silent, and then the old man's hand grasped the starting lever.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"157",545,"There was a frightful roaring beneath us--the giant frame trembled and","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"158",545,"vibrated--there was a rush of sound as the loose earth passed up","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"159",545,"through the hollow space between the inner and outer jackets to be","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"160",545,"deposited in our wake.  We were off!","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"161",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"162",545,"The noise was deafening.  The sensation was frightful.  For a full","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"163",545,"minute neither of us could do aught but cling with the proverbial","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"164",545,"desperation of the drowning man to the handrails of our swinging seats.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"165",545,"Then Perry glanced at the thermometer.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"166",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"170",545,"That and the speedometer were both on my side of the cabin, and as I","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"171",545,"turned to take a reading from the former I could see Perry muttering.","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"172",545,"","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"173",545,"""Ten degrees rise--it cannot be possible!"" and then I saw him tug","At the Earth's Core","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
