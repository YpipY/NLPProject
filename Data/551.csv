"1793",551,"struck the thing in the neck, just above its body; but instead of","The Land That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"1819",551,"shaken by the frightfulness of the tragedy--until Olson remarked that","The Land That Time Forgot","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
