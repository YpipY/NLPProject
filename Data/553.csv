"94",553,"It all happened in a few seconds; but they were seconds that seemed","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"99",553,"might have given him safety and turn back in the direction of the bear.","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"101",553,"thing that should have been extinct ages before--ran for it and fired","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"102",553,"even as the beast was almost upon Bradley.  The men in the trees","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"103",553,"scarcely breathed.  It seemed to them such a futile thing for Tippet to","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"144",553,"erect and had features with just a shade more of the human cast about","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"975",553,"ending in strong, bony hands with clawlike fingers--almost talonlike in","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"976",553,"their suggestiveness.  The white robe was separated in front, revealing","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"977",553,"skinny legs and the further fact that the thing wore but the single","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"1929",553,"dated doubtlessly back into remote ages, far beyond what the outer","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"1937",553,"reaching down toward the surface of the water, and discovered that the","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"1941",553,"and that was to lower himself into the stream.  For only an instant he","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2091",553,"stepped to the edge of the platform and dumped the rubbish into the","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2094",553,"if it turned toward him there was none at all.  Bradley held his breath.","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2096",553,"The Wieroo paused a moment, gazing down into the water, then it","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2097",553,"straightened up and turned toward the Englishman.  Bradley did not","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2098",553,"move.  The Wieroo stopped and stared intently at him.  It approached","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2099",553,"him questioningly.  Still Bradley remained as though carved of stone.","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2100",553,"The creature was directly in front of him.  It stopped.  There was no","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2106",553,"platform, while Bradley, acting almost instinctively to the urge of the","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2107",553,"first law of nature, rolled the inanimate body over the edge into the","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2111",553,"within the apartment beyond.  What he saw was a large room, dimly","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2112",553,"lighted, and about the side rows of wooden vessels stacked one upon","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2113",553,"another.  There was no Wieroo in sight, so the Englishman entered.  At","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2114",553,"the far end of the room was another door, and as he crossed toward it,","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2115",553,"he glanced into some of the vessels, which he found were filled with","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2122",553,"that he might discover some easier way out of the city than that","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2127",553,"yards from the storeroom a ladder rose from the corridor through an","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2128",553,"aperture in the ceiling.  Bradley paused at the foot of it, debating","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2129",553,"the wisdom of further investigation against a return to the river; but","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2130",553,"strong within him was the spirit of exploration that has scattered his","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2131",553,"race to the four corners of the earth.  What new mysteries lay hidden","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2132",553,"in the chambers above?  The urge to know was strong upon him though his","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2133",553,"better judgment warned him that the safer course lay in retreat.  For a","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2134",553,"moment he stood thus, running his fingers through his hair; then he","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2135",553,"cast discretion to the winds and began the ascent.","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2141",553,"climbed fully fifty feet from the river level.  Here he discovered a","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"

"2145",553,"the room--a Wieroo, and a girl of human proportions.  She was standing","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
"2146",553,"with her back against a column which rose from the center of the","Out of Time's Abyss","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Science Fiction","en"
