"283",5699,"single garment, made of the skin of some yellow, short-haired animal. It","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"371",5699,"sound; and shortly the fourth Sanusian appeared. He was by far the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"372",5699,"larger; but his size was a matter of width rather than of height. An","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"378",5699,"His face was strong and handsome in a somewhat fierce, relentless way;","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"421",5699,"These four skin-clad savages seemed to be enjoying an aboriginal picnic.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"422",5699,"For lunch, they munched on various fruits and nuts picked up en route,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"423",5699,"together with handfuls of some wheat-like cereal which the big man had","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"436",5699,"learned that day was the strange manner in which the excursion came to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"437",5699,"an end. The quartet was at that moment climbing a small hill, apparently","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"438",5699,"on the edge of an extensive range of mountains. An occasional tree,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"439",5699,"something like an oak, broke the monotony of the brush at this point,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"441",5699,"Kinney could see surrounding country with any degree of clearness. Even","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"443",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"444",5699,"The hill was placed on one edge of a valley about forty miles in width.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"445",5699,"A good part of it was covered with dusty vegetation, presumably wild;","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"446",5699,"but the rest was plainly under cultivation. There were large green","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"447",5699,"areas, such as argued grain fields; elsewhere were what looked like","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"448",5699,"orchards and vineyards, some of which were in full bloom--refuting the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"449",5699,"notion that the season was a late one. Nowhere was there a spot of land","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"474",5699,"startling change came over him. Downright fear drove the anger from his","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"475",5699,"face; his massive body suddenly relaxed, and all his power and vigor","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"476",5699,"seemed to crumble and wilt. His hands shook; his mouth trembled. At the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"477",5699,"same time the two women shrank from him, each giving an inarticulate cry","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"478",5699,"of alarm and distress. Dulnop gave no sound, but the anger which had","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"479",5699,"left the herdsman seemed to have come to him; the youngster's eyes","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"480",5699,"flared and his breast heaved. His gaze was fixed upon Corrus's neck,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"482",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"483",5699,"Suddenly the big man dropped his head, as though in surrender. He gasped","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"484",5699,"and found voice; this time a voice as shaky and docile as it had been","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"485",5699,"strong and dominant a moment before.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"490",5699,"And instantly all four turned about, and in perfect silence took the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"500",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"501",5699,"Immediately upon going into tele-consciousness Smith became aware of a","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"502",5699,"decided change in his surroundings. The interior of the study had been","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"503",5699,"darkened with drawn shades; now he was using eyes that were exposed to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"504",5699,"the most intense sunlight. The first sight that he got, in fact, was","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"505",5699,"directed toward the sky; and he noted with an engineer's keen interest","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"506",5699,"that the color of the sky was blue, slightly tinged with orange. This,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"507",5699,"he knew, meant that the atmosphere of Sanus contained at least one","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"508",5699,"chemical element which is lacking on the earth.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"509",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"510",5699,"For a minute or two the sky remained entirely clear. There were no","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"511",5699,"clouds whatever; neither did any form of winged life make its","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"512",5699,"appearance. So Smith took note of sounds.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"513",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"514",5699,"Presumably his agent--whoever or whatever it might be--was located in","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"515",5699,"some sort of aircraft; for an extremely loud and steady buzzing,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"516",5699,"suggesting a powerful engine, filled the engineer's borrowed ears. Try","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"517",5699,"as he might, however, he could not identify the sound exactly. It was","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"518",5699,"more like an engine than anything else, except that the separate sounds","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"519",5699,"which comprised the buzz occurred infinitely close together. Smith","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"520",5699,"concluded that the machine was some highly developed rotary affair,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"521",5699,"working at perhaps six or eight thousand revolutions a minute--three or","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"522",5699,"four times as fast as an ordinary engine.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"523",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"524",5699,"Meanwhile his agent continued to stare into the sky. Shortly something","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"525",5699,"arrived in the field of vision; a blurred speck, far to one side. It","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"526",5699,"approached leisurely, with the unknown agent watching steadfastly. It","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"527",5699,"still remained blurred, however; for a long time the engineer knew as","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"528",5699,"little about its actual form as he knew about his mysterious agent.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"529",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"530",5699,"Then, like a flash, the vision cleared. All the blurring disappeared","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"531",5699,"instantly, and the form of a buzzard was disclosed. It was almost","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"532",5699,"directly overhead, about a quarter of a mile distant, and soaring in a","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"533",5699,"wide spiral. No sound whatever came from it. Smith's agent made no move","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"534",5699,"of any kind, but continued to watch.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"535",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"536",5699,"Shortly the buzzard ""banked"" for a sharper turn; and the engineer saw,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"537",5699,"by the perspective of its apparent speed, that the aircraft whose use he","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"538",5699,"was enjoying was likewise on the move. Apparently it was flying in a","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"539",5699,"straight line, keeping the sun--an object vastly too brilliant to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"540",5699,"examine--on the right.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"541",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"542",5699,"The buzzard went out of sight. Once more the clear sky was all that","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"543",5699,"could be seen; that, and the continual roar of the engine, were all that","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"544",5699,"Smith actually knew. He became impatient for his agent to look","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"545",5699,"elsewhere; it might be that the craft contained other specimens of the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"546",5699,"unknown creatures. But there was no change in the vigilant watch which","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"547",5699,"was being kept upon the sky.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"548",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"549",5699,"Suddenly the engineer became exceedingly alert. He had noticed something","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"550",5699,"new--something so highly different from anything he had expected to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"551",5699,"learn that it was some minutes before he could believe it true.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"552",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"553",5699,"His borrowed eyes had no eyelids! At least, if they did, they were never","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"554",5699,"used. Not once did they flicker in the slightest; not once did they","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"555",5699,"blink or wink, much less close themselves for a momentary rest from the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"556",5699,"sun's glare. They remained as stonily staring as the eyes of a marble","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"557",5699,"statue.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"558",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"559",5699,"Then something startling happened. With the most sickening suddenness","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"560",5699,"the aircraft came to an abrupt halt. Smith's senses swam with the jolt","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"561",5699,"of it. All about him was a confused jumble of blurred figures and forms;","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"562",5699,"it was infinitely worse than his first ride in a hoist. In a moment,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"563",5699,"however, he was able to examine things fairly well.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"564",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"565",5699,"The aircraft had come to a stop in the middle of what looked like a cane","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"566",5699,"brake. On all sides rose yellowish-green shafts, bearing leaves","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"567",5699,"characteristic of the maize family. Smith knew little about cane, yet","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"568",5699,"felt sure that these specimens were a trifle large. ""Possibly due to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"569",5699,"difference in gravitation,"" he thought.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"570",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"571",5699,"However, he could not tell much about the spot on which the machine had","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"572",5699,"landed. For a moment it was motionless; the engine had been stopped, and","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"573",5699,"all was silent except for the gentle rustling of the cane in the field.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"574",5699,"The unknown operator did not change his position in the slightest. Then","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"575",5699,"the craft began to move over the surface, in a jerky lurching fashion","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"576",5699,"which indicated a very rough piece of ground. At the same time a queer,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"577",5699,"leathery squeaking came to the engineer's borrowed ears; he concluded","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"578",5699,"that the machine was being sorely strained by the motion. At the time he","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"579",5699,"was puzzled to account for the motion itself. Either there was another","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"580",5699,"occupant of the craft, who had climbed out and was now pushing the thing","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"581",5699,"along the ground, or else some form of silent mechanism was operating","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"582",5699,"the wheels upon which, presumably, the craft was mounted. Shortly the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"583",5699,"motion stopped altogether.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"584",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"585",5699,"It was then that Smith noticed something he had so far ignored because","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"586",5699,"he knew his own dinner hour was approaching. His agent was hungry, like","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"587",5699,"himself. He noticed it because, just then, he received a very definite","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"588",5699,"impression of the opposite feeling; the agent was eating lunch of some","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"589",5699,"sort, and enjoying it. There was no doubt about this. All that Smith","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"590",5699,"could do was to wish, for the hundredth time, that he could look around","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"591",5699,"a little and see what was being eaten, and how.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"592",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"593",5699,"The meal occupied several minutes. Not once did the strange occupant of","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"594",5699,"that machine relax his stony stare at the sky, and Smith tried to forget","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"595",5699,"how hungry he was by estimating the extent of his vision. He decided","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"596",5699,"that the angle subtended about a hundred and sixty degrees, or almost","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"597",5699,"half a circle; and he further concluded that if his agent possessed a","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"598",5699,"nose, it was a pretty trifling affair, too small to be noticed. It was","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"599",5699,"obvious, too, that the fellow's mouth was located much lower in the face","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"600",5699,"than normal. He ate without showing a single particle of food, and did","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"601",5699,"it very quietly.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"602",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"603",5699,"At length hunger was satisfied. There was complete stillness and silence","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"604",5699,"for a moment, then another short lurching journey through the cane; and","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"605",5699,"next, with an abruptness that made the engineer's senses swim again, the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"606",5699,"fellow once more took to the air. The speed with which he ""got away"" was","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"607",5699,"enough to make a motorcyclist, doing his best, seem to stand still.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"608",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"609",5699,"It took time for Smith to regain his balance. When he did, the same","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"612",5699,"bleary forms which shortly resolved themselves into mountain tops. It","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"613",5699,"was odd, the way things suddenly flashed into full view. One second they","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"614",5699,"would be blurred and unrecognizable; the next, sharply outlined and","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"615",5699,"distinct as anything the engineer had ever seen. Yet, there seemed to be","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"616",5699,"no change in the focus of those eyes. It wasn't as though they were","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"617",5699,"telescopic, either. Not until long afterward did Smith understand the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"620",5699,"The mountains grew higher and nearer. Before long it seemed as though","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"621",5699,"the aircraft was entering some sort of a canon. Its sides were only","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"622",5699,"sparsely covered with vegetation, and all of it was quite brown, as","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"623",5699,"though the season were autumn. For the most part the surface was of","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"624",5699,"broken rock and boulders.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"625",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"626",5699,"Within a space of three or four minutes the engineer counted not less","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"628",5699,"attention to them, but continued his extraordinary watch of the heavens.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"629",5699,"Smith began to wonder if the chap were not seated in an air-tight,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"637",5699,"landed approximately in the middle of the canon, and presumably among","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"638",5699,"the boulders in its bottom. For all about it were the tops of gigantic","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"639",5699,"rocks, most of them worn smooth from water action. And, as soon as the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"640",5699,"engine stopped, Smith plainly heard the roar of water right at hand. He","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"641",5699,"could not see it, however. Why in the name of wonder didn't the fellow","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"642",5699,"look down, for a change?","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"643",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"644",5699,"The craft began to move. This time its motion was smoother arguing an","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"646",5699,"astonishment, it began to move straight down a slope so steep that no","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"648",5699,"As this happened, his adopted eyes told him that the craft was located","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"649",5699,"upon one of those enormous boulders, in the center of a stream of such","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"650",5699,"absolute immensity that he fairly gasped. The thing was--colossal!","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"651",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"652",5699,"And yet it was true. The unseen machine deliberately moved along until","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"661",5699,"again for indications of eyelids. He saw not one flicker, but noticed a","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"662",5699,"certain tiny come-and-go, the merest sort of vibration, which indicated","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"663",5699,"the agent's heart-action. Apparently it beat more than twice as fast as","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"665",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"666",5699,"But it relieved him to know that his agent was at least a genuine living","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"668",5699,"Suppose this Sanusian were not any form of natural creature at all, but","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"669",5699,"some sort of supermachine, capable of functioning like an organism? The","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"674",5699,"water was exceedingly rough, and only a confused brownish blur could be","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"675",5699,"made out. Once he caught a queer sound above the noise of the water; a","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"679",5699,"And then, with that peculiar sound fresh in his ears, came the crowning","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"680",5699,"shock of the whole experience. Floating toward the boulder, but some","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"681",5699,"distance away, was what looked like a black seed. Next moment the vision","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"682",5699,"flashed clear, as usual, and the engineer saw that the object was really","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"683",5699,"a beetle; and in a second it was so near that Smith's own body, back on","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"684",5699,"the earth, involuntarily shrank back into the recesses of his chair.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"685",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"686",5699,"For that beetle was an enormity in the most unlimited sense of the word.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"690",5699,"But before Smith could get over his amazement there was a rush and a","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2722",5699,"A large drone passed within six feet of them. Both heard the buzz, and","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2730",5699,"The two sped over the rocks, making pretty good time considering the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2732",5699,"fruits and nuts, also a gourd not so full. In fact, it had been some","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2733",5699,"while since they had had fresh water. Cunora was further weighed down by","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2734",5699,"some six pounds of dried rabbit meat; the animals had been caught in","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2735",5699,"snares. Both, however, discarded their palm leaves; they would be of no","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2739",5699,"before the drone would return with enough soldiers to compel obedience.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2740",5699,"For the most part, the surface was rough granite, with very little sign","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2741",5699,"of erosion. There was almost no water; both women showed intense joy","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2742",5699,"when they found a tiny pool of it standing in a crevasse. They filled","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2745",5699,"A few steps farther on, and the pair stepped out of the shallow gully in","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2746",5699,"which they had been walking. Immediately they were exposed to a very","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2747",5699,"strong and exceedingly cold wind, such as seemed to surprise them in no","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2748",5699,"way, but compelled both to actually lean against its force. Moreover,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2749",5699,"although this pressure was all from the left, it proved exceedingly","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2750",5699,"difficult to go on. Their legs seemed made of lead, and their breathing","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2751",5699,"was strangely labored. This, also, appeared to be just what they had","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2752",5699,"expected.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2753",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2754",5699,"Presently, however, they found another slight depression the rocks; and","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2755",5699,"sheltered from the wind, made a little better progress ahead. It was","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2756",5699,"bitter cold, however; only the violence of their exercise could make","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2757",5699,"them warm enough to stand it. All in all, the two were considerably over","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2758",5699,"three hours in making the last mile; they had to stop frequently to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2759",5699,"rest. The only compensating thing was their freedom from worry; the bees","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2760",5699,"would not bother them where the wind was so strong. So long as they","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2762",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2763",5699,"But what made it worse was the steadily increasing difficulty of moving","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2765",5699,"CLIMBING now, where before they had simply walked. It was just as though","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2766",5699,"the plateau had changed into a mountain, and they were ascending it;","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2767",5699,"only, upon looking back, nothing but comparatively flat rock met the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2768",5699,"gaze. What made them lean forward so steeply anyhow?","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2769",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2770",5699,"Rolla seemed to think it all very ordinary. She was more concerned about","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2771",5699,"the wind, to which they had become once more exposed as they reached the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2772",5699,"end of the rift. On they pressed, five or six steps at each attempt,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2773",5699,"stopping to rest twice the length of time they actually traveled. It was","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2774",5699,"necessary now to cling to the rock with both hands, and once Cunora lost","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2775",5699,"her grip, so that she would have been blown to one side, or else have","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2778",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2779",5699,"""Courage!"" gasped Rolla. Perspiration was streaming down her face,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2781",5699,"she was undergoing. ""Courage, Cunora! It be not much farther!"" On they","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2782",5699,"strove. Always it seemed as though they were working upward as well as","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2783",5699,"onward, although the continued flatness of the surface argued","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2784",5699,"obstinately against this. Also, the sun remained in the same position","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3106",5699,"another block came across two skeletons lying right in the middle of the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3195",5699,"their behavior. All twelve seemed to be silent only because they were","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3196",5699,"voraciously hungry. A meal was spread on the table. Except for the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3197",5699,"garments, the twelve might have been so many harvest hands, gathered for","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3198",5699,"the evening meal in the cook-house. From the white-bearded man who sat","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3199",5699,"at the head of the table and passed out large helpings of something from","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3200",5699,"a big pot, to the fair-haired young fellow at the foot, who could","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3201",5699,"scarcely wait for his share, there was only one thing about them which","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3202",5699,"might have been labeled pious; and that was their attitude, which could","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3203",5699,"have been interpreted: ""Give us this day our daily bread--and hurry up","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3205",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3206",5699,"Apparently Rolla was convinced that these men were thoroughly human, and","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3207",5699,"as such fairly safe to approach. For she allowed her curiosity to govern","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3208",5699,"her caution, and proceeded to sidle through the doorway. Half-way","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3209",5699,"through she caught a whiff of the food, and her sidling changed to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3210",5699,"something faster.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3211",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3212",5699,"At that instant she was seen. A tall, dark-haired chap on the far side","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3213",5699,"of the table glanced up and gave a sharp, startled exclamation.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3214",5699,"Instantly the whole dozen whirled around and with one accord shot to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3218",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3219",5699,"There was a second's silence; then the white-bearded man, who seemed, to","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3220",5699,"be the leader of the group, said something peremptory in a deep,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3221",5699,"compelling voice. Rolla did not understand.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3222",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3223",5699,"He repeated it, this time a little less commandingly; and Rolla, after","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3224",5699,"swallowing desperately, inclined her head in the diffident way she had,","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3225",5699,"and said:","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3226",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3229",5699,"Eleven of the twelve looked puzzled. The dark-haired man, who had been","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3230",5699,"the first to see her, however, gave a muttered exclamation; then he","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3231",5699,"cogitated a moment, wet his lips and said something that sounded like:","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3232",5699,"""What did you say? Say it again!""","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3233",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3235",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3236",5699,"The dark-haired man listened intently. Immediately he fell to nodding","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3237",5699,"with great vigor, and thought deeply again before making another try:","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3238",5699,"""We are your friends. Whence came ye, and what seek ye?""","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3239",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3240",5699,"Rolla had to listen closely to what he said. The language was","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3241",5699,"substantially the same as hers; but the verbs were misplaced in the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3242",5699,"sentences, the accenting was different, and certain of the vowels were","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3243",5699,"flatted. After a little, however, the man caught her way of talking and","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3244",5699,"was able to approximate it quite well, so that she understood him","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3246",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3255",5699,"Instantly she noted that the twelve became greatly excited when Somat","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3271",5699,"brought another stool, also dishes and table utensils.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3272",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3273",5699,"Whereupon the watchers on the earth got a first-class surprise. Here","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3275",5699,"amid the ruins of a great city; but the men had been eating from hand-","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3276",5699,"painted china of the finest quality, and using silverware that was","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"3278",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3279",5699,"Rolla, however, paid little attention to these details. She was scarcely","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3280",5699,"curious as to the food, which consisted of some sort of vegetable and","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3281",5699,"meat stew, together with butterless bread, a kind of small-grained corn","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3282",5699,"on the cob, a yellowish root-vegetable not unlike turnips, and large","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3283",5699,"quantities of berries. She was too hungry to be particular, and ate","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3284",5699,"heartily of all that was offered, whether cooked or uncooked. The twelve","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3285",5699,"almost forgot their own hunger in their interest in the stranger.","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3286",5699,"","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3287",5699,"It was now pretty dark in the big room. The white-bearded man said","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3288",5699,"something to the young fellow at the foot of the table, whereupon the","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"3289",5699,"chap got up and stepped to the nearest wall, where he pressed something","The Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
