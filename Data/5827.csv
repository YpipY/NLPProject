"47",5827,"derived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"49",5827,"I am now sitting in a chair, at a table of a certain shape, on which I","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"57",5827,"books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"58",5827,"the table which I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"59",5827,"so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"60",5827,"doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"61",5827,"and all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"62",5827,"that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"63",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"64",5827,"To make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention on the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"66",5827,"smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"69",5827,"but as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. Although","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"70",5827,"I believe that the table is 'really' of the same colour all over, the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"71",5827,"parts that reflect the light look much brighter than the other parts,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"72",5827,"and some parts look white because of reflected light. I know that, if","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"73",5827,"I move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"74",5827,"apparent distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"75",5827,"that if several people are looking at the table at the same moment, no","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"76",5827,"two of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"86",5827,"'appearance' and 'reality', between what things seem to be and what they","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"93",5827,"there is no colour which pre-eminently appears to be _the_ colour of the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"94",5827,"table, or even of any one particular part of the table--it appears to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"96",5827,"no reason for regarding some of these as more really its colour than","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"97",5827,"others. And we know that even from a given point of view the colour will","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"99",5827,"man wearing blue spectacles, while in the dark there will be no colour","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"100",5827,"at all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. This","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"101",5827,"colour is not something which is inherent in the table, but something","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"102",5827,"depending upon the table and the spectator and the way the light falls","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"103",5827,"on the table. When, in ordinary life, we speak of _the_ colour of the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"104",5827,"table, we only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"105",5827,"normal spectator from an ordinary point of view under usual conditions","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"106",5827,"of light. But the other colours which appear under other conditions","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"107",5827,"have just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"108",5827,"favouritism, we are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"109",5827,"one particular colour.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"110",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"111",5827,"The same thing applies to the texture. With the naked eye one can see","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"112",5827,"the grain, but otherwise the table looks smooth and even. If we looked","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"113",5827,"at it through a microscope, we should see roughnesses and hills and","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"114",5827,"valleys, and all sorts of differences that are imperceptible to the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"115",5827,"naked eye. Which of these is the 'real' table? We are naturally tempted","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"116",5827,"to say that what we see through the microscope is more real, but that in","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"117",5827,"turn would be changed by a still more powerful microscope. If, then, we","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"118",5827,"cannot trust what we see with the naked eye, why should we trust what we","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"119",5827,"see through a microscope? Thus, again, the confidence in our senses with","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"120",5827,"which we began deserts us.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"121",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"122",5827,"The shape of the table is no better. We are all in the habit of judging","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"123",5827,"as to the 'real' shapes of things, and we do this so unreflectingly that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"124",5827,"we come to think we actually see the real shapes. But, in fact, as we","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"125",5827,"all have to learn if we try to draw, a given thing looks different","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"126",5827,"in shape from every different point of view. If our table is 'really'","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"127",5827,"rectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"128",5827,"two acute angles and two obtuse angles. If opposite sides are parallel,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"129",5827,"they will look as if they converged to a point away from the spectator;","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"130",5827,"if they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"131",5827,"longer. All these things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"132",5827,"because experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shape from the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"133",5827,"apparent shape, and the 'real' shape is what interests us as practical","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"134",5827,"men. But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is something inferred","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"135",5827,"from what we see. And what we see is constantly changing in shape as we","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"136",5827,"move about the room; so that here again the senses seem not to give us","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"137",5827,"the truth about the table itself, but only about the appearance of the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"140",5827,"Similar difficulties arise when we consider the sense of touch. It is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"141",5827,"true that the table always gives us a sensation of hardness, and we feel","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"142",5827,"that it resists pressure. But the sensation we obtain depends upon how","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"143",5827,"hard we press the table and also upon what part of the body we press","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"144",5827,"with; thus the various sensations due to various pressures or various","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"145",5827,"parts of the body cannot be supposed to reveal _directly_ any definite","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"146",5827,"property of the table, but at most to be _signs_ of some property which","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"147",5827,"perhaps _causes_ all the sensations, but is not actually apparent in any","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"148",5827,"of them. And the same applies still more obviously to the sounds which","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"149",5827,"can be elicited by rapping the table.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"150",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"151",5827,"Thus it becomes evident that the real table, if there is one, is not the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"152",5827,"same as what we immediately experience by sight or touch or hearing. The","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"153",5827,"real table, if there is one, is not _immediately_ known to us at all,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"154",5827,"but must be an inference from what is immediately known. Hence, two very","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"155",5827,"difficult questions at once arise; namely, (1) Is there a real table at","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"156",5827,"all? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be?","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"157",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"158",5827,"It will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"159",5827,"terms of which the meaning is definite and clear. Let us give the name","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"160",5827,"of 'sense-data' to the things that are immediately known in sensation:","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"161",5827,"such things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"162",5827,"so on. We shall give the name 'sensation' to the experience of being","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"163",5827,"immediately aware of these things. Thus, whenever we see a colour,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"164",5827,"we have a sensation _of_ the colour, but the colour itself is a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"165",5827,"sense-datum, not a sensation. The colour is that _of_ which we are","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"166",5827,"immediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation. It is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"167",5827,"plain that if we are to know anything about the table, it must be","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"168",5827,"by means of the sense-data--brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"169",5827,"etc.--which we associate with the table; but, for the reasons which have","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"170",5827,"been given, we cannot say that the table is the sense-data, or even","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"171",5827,"that the sense-data are directly properties of the table. Thus a problem","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"172",5827,"arises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table, supposing","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"233",5827,"not, the argument has been very widely advanced in one form or another;","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"236",5827,"'idealists'. When they come to explaining matter, they either say, like","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"237",5827,"Berkeley, that matter is really nothing but a collection of ideas,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"238",5827,"or they say, like Leibniz (1646-1716), that what appears as matter is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"241",5827,"But these philosophers, though they deny matter as opposed to mind,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"242",5827,"nevertheless, in another sense, admit matter. It will be remembered that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"243",5827,"we asked two questions; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"244",5827,"so, what sort of object can it be? Now both Berkeley and Leibniz admit","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"245",5827,"that there is a real table, but Berkeley says it is certain ideas in the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"246",5827,"mind of God, and Leibniz says it is a colony of souls. Thus both of them","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"247",5827,"answer our first question in the affirmative, and only diverge from the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"248",5827,"views of ordinary mortals in their answer to our second question. In","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"249",5827,"fact, almost all philosophers seem to be agreed that there is a real","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"250",5827,"table: they almost all agree that, however much our sense-data--colour,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"258",5827,"that there _is_ a real table, whatever its nature may be--is vitally","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"259",5827,"important, and it will be worth while to consider what reasons there are","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"260",5827,"for accepting this view before we go on to the further question as","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"264",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"265",5827,"Before we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment what it","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"266",5827,"is that we have discovered so far. It has appeared that, if we take any","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"267",5827,"common object of the sort that is supposed to be known by the senses,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"268",5827,"what the senses _immediately_ tell us is not the truth about the object","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"269",5827,"as it is apart from us, but only the truth about certain sense-data","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"270",5827,"which, so far as we can see, depend upon the relations between us and","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"271",5827,"the object. Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance',","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"272",5827,"which we believe to be a sign of some 'reality' behind. But if the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"273",5827,"reality is not what appears, have we any means of knowing whether there","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"274",5827,"is any reality at all? And if so, have we any means of finding out what","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"277",5827,"Such questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know that even","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"279",5827,"which has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"280",5827,"problem full of surprising possibilities. The one thing we know about it","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"281",5827,"is that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest result, so far, we","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"282",5827,"have the most complete liberty of conjecture. Leibniz tells us it is a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"857",5827,"there is not the slightest ground for supposing that there is anything","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"858",5827,"real about the tree except what is perceived. Its being, he says,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"874",5827,"There are in this argument a good many fallacies which have been","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"875",5827,"important in the history of philosophy, and which it will be as well to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"876",5827,"bring to light. In the first place, there is a confusion engendered by","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"877",5827,"the use of the word 'idea'. We think of an idea as essentially something","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"878",5827,"in somebody's mind, and thus when we are told that a tree consists","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"879",5827,"entirely of ideas, it is natural to suppose that, if so, the tree","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"880",5827,"must be entirely in minds. But the notion of being 'in' the mind is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"881",5827,"ambiguous. We speak of bearing a person in mind, not meaning that the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"882",5827,"person is in our minds, but that a thought of him is in our minds. When","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"883",5827,"a man says that some business he had to arrange went clean out of his","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"884",5827,"mind, he does not mean to imply that the business itself was ever in his","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"885",5827,"mind, but only that a thought of the business was formerly in his mind,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"886",5827,"but afterwards ceased to be in his mind. And so when Berkeley says that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"887",5827,"the tree must be in our minds if we can know it, all that he really has","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"888",5827,"a right to say is that a thought of the tree must be in our minds. To","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"890",5827,"person whom we bear in mind is himself in our minds. This confusion","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"891",5827,"may seem too gross to have been really committed by any competent","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"892",5827,"philosopher, but various attendant circumstances rendered it possible.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"893",5827,"In order to see how it was possible, we must go more deeply into the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"896",5827,"Before taking up the general question of the nature of ideas, we must","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"897",5827,"disentangle two entirely separate questions which arise concerning","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"898",5827,"sense-data and physical objects. We saw that, for various reasons of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"899",5827,"detail, Berkeley was right in treating the sense-data which constitute","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"900",5827,"our perception of the tree as more or less subjective, in the sense that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"901",5827,"they depend upon us as much as upon the tree, and would not exist if the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"902",5827,"tree were not being perceived. But this is an entirely different point","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"903",5827,"from the one by which Berkeley seeks to prove that whatever can be","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"904",5827,"immediately known must be in a mind. For this purpose arguments of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"905",5827,"detail as to the dependence of sense-data upon us are useless. It is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"906",5827,"necessary to prove, generally, that by being known, things are shown to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"907",5827,"be mental. This is what Berkeley believes himself to have done. It","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"908",5827,"is this question, and not our previous question as to the difference","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"913",5827,"on the one hand the thing of which we are aware--say the colour of my","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"917",5827,"mental? Our previous arguments concerning the colour did not prove it to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"924",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"925",5827,"Berkeley's view, that obviously the colour must be in the mind, seems","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"926",5827,"to depend for its plausibility upon confusing the thing apprehended","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"927",5827,"with the act of apprehension. Either of these might be called an 'idea';","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"928",5827,"probably either would have been called an idea by Berkeley. The act","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"929",5827,"is undoubtedly in the mind; hence, when we are thinking of the act,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"930",5827,"we readily assent to the view that ideas must be in the mind. Then,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"931",5827,"forgetting that this was only true when ideas were taken as acts of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"932",5827,"apprehension, we transfer the proposition that 'ideas are in the mind'","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"933",5827,"to ideas in the other sense, i.e. to the things apprehended by our acts","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"936",5827,"seems to be the true analysis of Berkeley's argument, and the ultimate","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"945",5827,"mind's power of knowing things. If we say that the things known must be","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"950",5827,"shall have to admit that what, _in this sense_, is in the mind,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"1250",5827,"Bismarck. Assuming that there is such a thing as direct acquaintance","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"1251",5827,"with oneself, Bismarck himself might have used his name directly to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"1252",5827,"designate the particular person with whom he was acquainted. In this","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"1253",5827,"case, if he made a judgement about himself, he himself might be a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"1254",5827,"constituent of the judgement. Here the proper name has the direct use","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"1255",5827,"which it always wishes to have, as simply standing for a certain object,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"1256",5827,"and not for a description of the object. But if a person who knew","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"1545",5827,"sometimes, on the basis of observation, we can see that only one law","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"1550",5827,"second is that the reign of law would seem to be itself only probable,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"1551",5827,"and that our belief that it will hold in the future, or in unexamined","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"1570",5827,"expectation in a single fresh instance. But we want also to know that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2114",5827,"as concerned rather with the way we must think than with any fact of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2115",5827,"the outer world. We noted in the preceding chapter the three principles","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2116",5827,"commonly called 'laws of thought'. The view which led to their being so","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2117",5827,"named is a natural one, but there are strong reasons for thinking","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2118",5827,"that it is erroneous. Let us take as an illustration the law of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2119",5827,"contradiction. This is commonly stated in the form 'Nothing can both be","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2120",5827,"and not be', which is intended to express the fact that nothing can at","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2121",5827,"once have and not have a given quality. Thus, for example, if a tree","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2122",5827,"is a beech it cannot also be not a beech; if my table is rectangular it","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2124",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2125",5827,"Now what makes it natural to call this principle a law of _thought_","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2126",5827,"is that it is by thought rather than by outward observation that we","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2127",5827,"persuade ourselves of its necessary truth. When we have seen that a tree","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2128",5827,"is a beech, we do not need to look again in order to ascertain whether","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2129",5827,"it is also not a beech; thought alone makes us know that this is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2130",5827,"impossible. But the conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2131",5827,"of _thought_ is nevertheless erroneous. What we believe, when we believe","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2132",5827,"the law of contradiction, is not that the mind is so made that it must","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2133",5827,"believe the law of contradiction. _This_ belief is a subsequent result","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2134",5827,"of psychological reflection, which presupposes the belief in the law of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2135",5827,"contradiction. The belief in the law of contradiction is a belief about","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2136",5827,"things, not only about thoughts. It is not, e.g., the belief that if we","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2137",5827,"_think_ a certain tree is a beech, we cannot at the same time _think_","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2138",5827,"that it is not a beech; it is the belief that if the tree _is_ a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2139",5827,"beech, it cannot at the same time _be_ not a beech. Thus the law of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2140",5827,"contradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts; and","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2141",5827,"although belief in the law of contradiction is a thought, the law of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2142",5827,"contradiction itself is not a thought, but a fact concerning the things","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2403",5827,"in discussing Berkeley in Chapter IV. In the strict sense, it is not","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2404",5827,"whiteness that is in our mind, but the act of thinking of whiteness. The","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2405",5827,"connected ambiguity in the word 'idea', which we noted at the same time,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2408",5827,"'idea'. Hence, if the ambiguity is not guarded against, we may come to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2409",5827,"think that whiteness is an 'idea' in the other sense, i.e. an act of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2410",5827,"thought; and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental. But in so","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2412",5827,"act of thought is necessarily a different thing from another man's; one","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2481",5827,"in common is a certain relation between their parts, namely the relation","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2482",5827,"which I call 'being to the left of'. In this way I become acquainted","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2613",5827,"induction, and the connexion of universals may be only subsequently","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2614",5827,"perceived. For example, it is known that if we draw perpendiculars","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2622",5827,"The other point is more interesting, and of more philosophical","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2623",5827,"importance. It is, that we may sometimes know a general proposition in","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2624",5827,"cases where we do not know a single instance of it. Take such a case as","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2625",5827,"the following: We know that any two numbers can be multiplied together,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2626",5827,"and will give a third called their _product_. We know that all pairs","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2627",5827,"of integers the product of which is less than 100 have been actually","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2628",5827,"multiplied together, and the value of the product recorded in the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2630",5827,"infinite, and that only a finite number of pairs of integers ever have","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2631",5827,"been or ever will be thought of by human beings. Hence it follows that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2632",5827,"there are pairs of integers which never have been and never will be","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2721",5827,"no further reason is even theoretically discoverable. Starting with the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2722",5827,"common beliefs of daily life, we can be driven back from point to point,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2776",5827,"itself, like everything else in the world of sense, is of a radically","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2777",5827,"different kind from the things that are true or false, and therefore","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2778",5827,"cannot properly be said to be _true_. Thus whatever self-evident truths","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2783",5827,"perception, though perhaps in the last analysis the two kinds may","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2784",5827,"coalesce. First, there is the kind which simply asserts the _existence_","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2785",5827,"of the sense-datum, without in any way analysing it. We see a patch","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2786",5827,"of red, and we judge 'there is such-and-such a patch of red', or more","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2787",5827,"strictly 'there is that'; this is one kind of intuitive judgement of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2788",5827,"perception. The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2789",5827,"and we subject it to some degree of analysis. If, for instance, we see a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2790",5827,"_round_ patch of red, we may judge 'that patch of red is round'. This is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2791",5827,"again a judgement of perception, but it differs from our previous kind.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2792",5827,"In our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2793",5827,"and shape: the colour is red and the shape is round. Our judgement","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2794",5827,"analyses the datum into colour and shape, and then recombines them by","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2795",5827,"stating that the red colour is round in shape. Another example of this","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2796",5827,"kind of judgement is 'this is to the right of that', where 'this'","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2797",5827,"and 'that' are seen simultaneously. In this kind of judgement the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2798",5827,"sense-datum contains constituents which have some relation to each","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2799",5827,"other, and the judgement asserts that these constituents have this","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2802",5827,"Another class of intuitive judgements, analogous to those of sense and","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2803",5827,"yet quite distinct from them, are judgements of _memory_. There is some","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2804",5827,"danger of confusion as to the nature of memory, owing to the fact that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2805",5827,"memory of an object is apt to be accompanied by an image of the object,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2806",5827,"and yet the image cannot be what constitutes memory. This is easily seen","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2807",5827,"by merely noticing that the image is in the present, whereas what is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2808",5827,"remembered is known to be in the past. Moreover, we are certainly able","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2809",5827,"to some extent to compare our image with the object remembered, so","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2810",5827,"that we often know, within somewhat wide limits, how far our image is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2811",5827,"accurate; but this would be impossible, unless the object, as opposed to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2812",5827,"the image, were in some way before the mind. Thus the essence of memory","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2813",5827,"is not constituted by the image, but by having immediately before the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2814",5827,"mind an object which is recognized as past. But for the fact of memory","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2815",5827,"in this sense, we should not know that there ever was a past at all,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2816",5827,"nor should we be able to understand the word 'past', any more than a man","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2817",5827,"born blind can understand the word 'light'. Thus there must be intuitive","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2818",5827,"judgements of memory, and it is upon them, ultimately, that all our","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2819",5827,"knowledge of the past depends.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2820",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2821",5827,"The case of memory, however, raises a difficulty, for it is notoriously","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2822",5827,"fallacious, and thus throws doubt on the trustworthiness of intuitive","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2823",5827,"judgements in general. This difficulty is no light one. But let us","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2824",5827,"first narrow its scope as far as possible. Broadly speaking, memory is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2825",5827,"trustworthy in proportion to the vividness of the experience and to its","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2826",5827,"nearness in time. If the house next door was struck by lightning half a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2827",5827,"minute ago, my memory of what I saw and heard will be so reliable that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2828",5827,"it would be preposterous to doubt whether there had been a flash at","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2829",5827,"all. And the same applies to less vivid experiences, so long as they are","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2830",5827,"recent. I am absolutely certain that half a minute ago I was sitting in","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2831",5827,"the same chair in which I am sitting now. Going backward over the day,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2833",5827,"almost certain, other things of which I can become certain by thought","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2834",5827,"and by calling up attendant circumstances, and some things of which I","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2835",5827,"am by no means certain. I am quite certain that I ate my breakfast this","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2836",5827,"morning, but if I were as indifferent to my breakfast as a philosopher","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2837",5827,"should be, I should be doubtful. As to the conversation at breakfast,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2839",5827,"large element of doubt, and some not at all. Thus there is a continual","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2840",5827,"gradation in the degree of self-evidence of what I remember, and a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2841",5827,"corresponding gradation in the trustworthiness of my memory.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2842",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2843",5827,"Thus the first answer to the difficulty of fallacious memory is to say","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2844",5827,"that memory has degrees of self-evidence, and that these correspond","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2845",5827,"to the degrees of its trustworthiness, reaching a limit of perfect","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2846",5827,"self-evidence and perfect trustworthiness in our memory of events which","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2853",5827,"generally associated with it. George IV is said to have at last believed","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2854",5827,"that he was at the battle of Waterloo, because he had so often said that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2907",5827,"what is true. We know that on very many subjects different people","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2909",5827,"erroneous. Since erroneous beliefs are often held just as strongly","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2910",5827,"as true beliefs, it becomes a difficult question how they are to be","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2911",5827,"distinguished from true beliefs. How are we to know, in a given case,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2912",5827,"that our belief is not erroneous? This is a question of the very","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2913",5827,"greatest difficulty, to which no completely satisfactory answer is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2916",5827,"this preliminary question which is to be considered in this chapter. In","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2927",5827,"There are three points to observe in the attempt to discover the nature","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2928",5827,"of truth, three requisites which any theory must fulfil.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2929",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2930",5827,"(1) Our theory of truth must be such as to admit of its opposite,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2931",5827,"falsehood. A good many philosophers have failed adequately to satisfy","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2932",5827,"this condition: they have constructed theories according to which all","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2933",5827,"our thinking ought to have been true, and have then had the greatest","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2934",5827,"difficulty in finding a place for falsehood. In this respect our theory","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2935",5827,"of belief must differ from our theory of acquaintance, since in the case","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2936",5827,"of acquaintance it was not necessary to take account of any opposite.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2937",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2938",5827,"(2) It seems fairly evident that if there were no beliefs there could","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2939",5827,"be no falsehood, and no truth either, in the sense in which truth is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2940",5827,"correlative to falsehood. If we imagine a world of mere matter, there","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2941",5827,"would be no room for falsehood in such a world, and although it would","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2942",5827,"contain what may be called 'facts', it would not contain any truths, in","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2944",5827,"In fact, truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs and statements:","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2945",5827,"hence a world of mere matter, since it would contain no beliefs or","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2947",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2949",5827,"the truth or falsehood of a belief always depends upon something which","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2950",5827,"lies outside the belief itself. If I believe that Charles I died on the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2951",5827,"scaffold, I believe truly, not because of any intrinsic quality of my","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2952",5827,"belief, which could be discovered by merely examining the belief, but","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2953",5827,"because of an historical event which happened two and a half centuries","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2954",5827,"ago. If I believe that Charles I died in his bed, I believe falsely: no","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2955",5827,"degree of vividness in my belief, or of care in arriving at it, prevents","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2956",5827,"it from being false, again because of what happened long ago, and not","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2957",5827,"because of any intrinsic property of my belief. Hence, although truth","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2958",5827,"and falsehood are properties of beliefs, they are properties dependent","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2959",5827,"upon the relations of the beliefs to other things, not upon any internal","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2961",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2962",5827,"The third of the above requisites leads us to adopt the view--which has","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2963",5827,"on the whole been commonest among philosophers--that truth consists in","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2964",5827,"some form of correspondence between belief and fact. It is, however, by","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2965",5827,"no means an easy matter to discover a form of correspondence to which","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2966",5827,"there are no irrefutable objections. By this partly--and partly by the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2970",5827,"of truth which shall not consist in relation to something wholly outside","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2971",5827,"belief. The most important attempt at a definition of this sort is the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2972",5827,"theory that truth consists in _coherence_. It is said that the mark of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2973",5827,"falsehood is failure to cohere in the body of our beliefs, and that it","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2977",5827,"There is, however, a great difficulty in this view, or rather two great","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2978",5827,"difficulties. The first is that there is no reason to suppose that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2979",5827,"only _one_ coherent body of beliefs is possible. It may be that, with","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2980",5827,"sufficient imagination, a novelist might invent a past for the world","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2981",5827,"that would perfectly fit on to what we know, and yet be quite different","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2982",5827,"from the real past. In more scientific matters, it is certain that there","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2983",5827,"are often two or more hypotheses which account for all the known facts","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2984",5827,"on some subject, and although, in such cases, men of science endeavour","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2985",5827,"to find facts which will rule out all the hypotheses except one, there","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2986",5827,"is no reason why they should always succeed.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2987",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2988",5827,"In philosophy, again, it seems not uncommon for two rival hypotheses","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2989",5827,"to be both able to account for all the facts. Thus, for example, it is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2993",5827,"reason to prefer it to the common-sense view, according to which other","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2994",5827,"people and things do really exist. Thus coherence as the definition","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"2996",5827,"coherent system.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2997",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"2998",5827,"The other objection to this definition of truth is that it assumes the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3002",5827,"order to know whether two propositions can both be true, we must","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3003",5827,"know such truths as the law of contradiction. For example, the two","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3004",5827,"propositions, 'this tree is a beech' and 'this tree is not a beech',","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3315",5827,"knowledge constituted by _perception_ (taking this word in its widest","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3323",5827,"in which it may be known: (1) by means of a judgement, in which its","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3324",5827,"several parts are judged to be related as they are in fact related; (2)","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3325",5827,"by means of _acquaintance_ with the complex fact itself, which may (in a","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3326",5827,"large sense) be called perception, though it is by no means confined to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3327",5827,"objects of the senses. Now it will be observed that the second way of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3328",5827,"knowing a complex fact, the way of acquaintance, is only possible when","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3329",5827,"there really is such a fact, while the first way, like all judgement,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3331",5827,"therefore only possible when its parts do actually have that relation","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3332",5827,"which makes them combine to form such a complex. The first way, on the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3334",5827,"only the reality of the parts and the relation: the relation may not","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3352",5827,"there is only one person who can be acquainted with the mental things","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3495",5827,"antithesis. This new idea, though less incomplete than the idea we","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3499",5827,"the 'Absolute Idea', which, according to him, has no incompleteness,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3699",5827,"no argument can begin. Hence the criticism of knowledge which philosophy","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3703",5827,"is unreasonable. Descartes' 'methodical doubt', with which modern","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3704",5827,"philosophy began, is not of this kind, but is rather the kind of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3705",5827,"criticism which we are asserting to be the essence of philosophy. His","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3706",5827,"'methodical doubt' consisted in doubting whatever seemed doubtful; in","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3708",5827,"on reflection, he could feel certain that he really knew it. This is the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3709",5827,"kind of criticism which constitutes philosophy. Some knowledge, such as","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3710",5827,"knowledge of the existence of our sense-data, appears quite indubitable,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3739",5827,"what is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. It is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3740",5827,"the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3741",5827,"many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3742",5827,"inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3744",5827,"matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3745",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3746",5827,"This view of philosophy appears to result, partly from a wrong","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3747",5827,"conception of the ends of life, partly from a wrong conception of the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3748",5827,"kind of goods which philosophy strives to achieve. Physical science,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3749",5827,"through the medium of inventions, is useful to innumerable people who","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3750",5827,"are wholly ignorant of it; thus the study of physical science is to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3751",5827,"be recommended, not only, or primarily, because of the effect on the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3752",5827,"student, but rather because of the effect on mankind in general. Thus","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3753",5827,"utility does not belong to philosophy. If the study of philosophy has","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3754",5827,"any value at all for others than students of philosophy, it must be only","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3755",5827,"indirectly, through its effects upon the lives of those who study it.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3756",5827,"It is in these effects, therefore, if anywhere, that the value of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3760",5827,"value of philosophy, we must first free our minds from the prejudices","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3761",5827,"of what are wrongly called 'practical' men. The 'practical' man, as","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3762",5827,"this word is often used, is one who recognizes only material needs, who","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3763",5827,"realizes that men must have food for the body, but is oblivious of the","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3764",5827,"necessity of providing food for the mind. If all men were well off, if","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3765",5827,"poverty and disease had been reduced to their lowest possible point,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3766",5827,"there would still remain much to be done to produce a valuable society;","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3767",5827,"and even in the existing world the goods of the mind are at least as","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3768",5827,"important as the goods of the body. It is exclusively among the goods of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3769",5827,"the mind that the value of philosophy is to be found; and only those who","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3770",5827,"are not indifferent to these goods can be persuaded that the study of","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3771",5827,"philosophy is not a waste of time.","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3772",5827,"","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3773",5827,"Philosophy, like all other studies, aims primarily at knowledge. The","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3774",5827,"knowledge it aims at is the kind of knowledge which gives unity and","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"

"3776",5827,"critical examination of the grounds of our convictions, prejudices, and","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3777",5827,"beliefs. But it cannot be maintained that philosophy has had any very","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3778",5827,"great measure of success in its attempts to provide definite answers to","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3779",5827,"its questions. If you ask a mathematician, a mineralogist, a historian,","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3780",5827,"or any other man of learning, what definite body of truths has been","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3781",5827,"ascertained by his science, his answer will last as long as you are","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3782",5827,"willing to listen. But if you put the same question to a philosopher, he","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3783",5827,"will, if he is candid, have to confess that his study has not achieved","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3784",5827,"positive results such as have been achieved by other sciences. It is","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3785",5827,"true that this is partly accounted for by the fact that, as soon as","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3786",5827,"definite knowledge concerning any subject becomes possible, this subject","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3787",5827,"ceases to be called philosophy, and becomes a separate science. The","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3788",5827,"whole study of the heavens, which now belongs to astronomy, was once","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3789",5827,"included in philosophy; Newton's great work was called 'the mathematical","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3790",5827,"principles of natural philosophy'. Similarly, the study of the human","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3791",5827,"mind, which was a part of philosophy, has now been separated from","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
"3792",5827,"philosophy and has become the science of psychology. Thus, to a great","The Problems of Philosophy","Russell, Bertrand","Philosophy","en"
