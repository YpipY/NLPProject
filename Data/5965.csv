"406",5965,"On all sides unseen apparatus gave forth a medley of subdued jars","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"408",5965,"And meanwhile Smith was staring hard, with the eyes he had borrowed","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"413",5965,"Smith was entirely ignorant of the surroundings. All he could","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"414",5965,"surmise was that his agents operated some sort of machinery.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"415",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"416",5965,"Then the agent glanced up; and Smith got his first shock. For he now","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"417",5965,"saw a cluster of indicating dials, such as one may see on the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"418",5965,"instrument board of any automobile; but the trained engineer found","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"419",5965,"himself absolutely unable to interpret one of them. They were marked","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"427",5965,"his best to make his agent look around the place. Other people might","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"428",5965,"be within sight. However, for a couple of minutes the oddly familiar","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"429",5965,"hands kept manipulating the unfamiliar instruments.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"430",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"431",5965,"Then, somewhere quite close at hand, a deep-toned gong sounded a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"432",5965,"single stroke. Instantly the agent looked up; and Smith saw that he","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"433",5965,"was inspecting the interior of a large engine-room. He had time to","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"434",5965,"note the huge bulk of a horizontal cylinder, perhaps fifty feet in","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"435",5965,"diameter, in the immediate background; also a variety of other","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"436",5965,"mechanisms, more like immensely enlarged editions of laboratory","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"437",5965,"apparatus than ordinary engines. Smith looked in vain for the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"438",5965,"compact form of a dynamo or motor, and listened in vain for the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"439",5965,"sound of either. Then, in swift succession, came two strokes on the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"440",5965,"unseen gong, followed by a shrill whistle.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"441",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"442",5965,"Smith's borrowed eyes became fixed upon that group of dials again.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"443",5965,"Their indicators began to shift, some rapidly, some slowly. Once the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"444",5965,"agent gave a swift glance through a round window--the place seemed","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"445",5965,"to be lighted by ordinary daylight--and Smith saw something","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"447",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"448",5965,"A little further progress, and then came three strokes on the gong,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"449",5965,"followed by a low thrumming. In response to these, the agent","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"450",5965,"deliberately picked out two levers, and pulled them down. When his","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"451",5965,"glance returned to the dials, one of them showed immense","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"452",5965,"acceleration.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"453",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"454",5965,"By and by came another triple clanging, another pair of levers was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"455",5965,"pulled down, and instantly the jarring and clanking gave way to a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"456",5965,"decided rumble, low and distinct, but so powerful that it shook the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"457",5965,"air. At the same time the agent quit his post and went over to the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"458",5965,"giant horizontal cylinder.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"459",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"460",5965,"Now Smith could see that this vast structure was merely part of an","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"461",5965,"engine whose dimensions were quite beyond any former experience. It","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"462",5965,"was a simple affair, being merely a reciprocal machine like the most","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"463",5965,"elementary form of steam engine. But, instead of being operated by","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"464",5965,"steam, it was a chemical machine; Smith's trained eyes told him that","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"465",5965,"the cylinder was really an enormous retort. And he noted with","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"466",5965,"further perplexity that the prodigious piston-rod not only moved","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"467",5965,"with terrific speed, but in a strictly back-and-forth motion; its","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"468",5965,"far end did not revolve.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"469",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"470",5965,"The agent seemed satisfied with it all. He turned about and","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"471",5965,"walked--so far as Smith could sense in the usual manner of earth's","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"472",5965,"humans--back to the dials again. Just then a door opened a short","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"473",5965,"distance away and another man entered.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"474",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"475",5965,"Smith would have mistaken him for the employee of some garage. He","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"476",5965,"was dressed in a suit of greasy blue overalls; and as he advanced","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"477",5965,"toward the eyes Smith was using, he looked about the room with","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"478",5965,"practiced glance. He merely nodded to Smith's man, who returned the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"479",5965,"nod just as silently; and such was the extreme brevity of it all,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"480",5965,"Smith was afterward unable to describe the man.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"481",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"482",5965,"His agent, thus relieved of his duty temporarily, strolled out","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"483",5965,"another door, which took him through a narrow corridor and another","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"484",5965,"door, opening on to some sort of a balcony, or deck. Smith fully","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"485",5965,"expected to look upon an ocean.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"486",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"487",5965,"Instead, he found himself gazing into a sea of clouds. He was in","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"488",5965,"some sort of aircraft!","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"489",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"490",5965,"Next moment, quite as though it had all been prearranged, a large","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"491",5965,"sky-cruiser hove into sight perhaps a quarter of a mile away. It","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"492",5965,"seemed to materialize out of the clouds, and rapidly bore down upon","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"493",5965,"the craft in which the agent stood.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"494",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"495",5965,"But the practical man of the earth was eying the air-ship in","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"496",5965,"increasing amazement. For it was truly a ship; a huge vessel","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"497",5965,"wonderfully like one of the old-fashioned freighters which used to","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"498",5965,"sail the seas of the earth. What was more, it had four tall, sloping","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"499",5965,"masts, each spread with something remarkably like canvas; and that","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"500",5965,"whole incredible hulk was actually swinging in mid air!","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"501",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"502",5965,"Looking closer, Smith saw that the masts were exceedingly tall; they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"503",5965,"held enough canvas to propel ten ships. And each stick sloped back","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"504",5965,"at so sharp an angle--much sharper than forty-five degrees--that the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"505",5965,"wind not only blew the craft along in its course, but actually","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"506",5965,"supported it as well.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"507",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"508",5965,"It meant a wind which would make a hurricane seem tame. Either that,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"509",5965,"or air with greater density than any Smith knew about.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"510",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"511",5965,"Suddenly the cruiser came about into the wind, and at the same","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"512",5965,"instant it began to take in sail, all the sheets furling in unison.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"513",5965,"Simultaneously great finlike wings shot out of slits in the sides of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"514",5965,"the hull; and immediately they began to beat the air, back and","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"515",5965,"forth, back and forth, with the speed and motion of swallows.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"516",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"517",5965,"So this was the meaning of the giant reciprocal engine! Instead of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"518",5965,"the screw propeller which characterized earth's aircraft, these","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"519",5965,"vessels employed the true bird principle, combining it with the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"520",5965,"simple methods of primitive sailing craft.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"521",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"522",5965,"As soon as the ship stopped its wind-driven rush and began to employ","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"523",5965,"its wings, the speed straightway slackened; and the ships began to","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"524",5965,"descend. About the same time the figures of several people appeared","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"525",5965,"on what might be called the bridge; and assuming that these people","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"526",5965,"were as large as the man whom Smith had seen enter the engine-room--a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"527",5965,"chap of average height--then that ship, in proportion, was all of a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"529",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"530",5965,"But Smith's awe was not shared by his agent, who turned","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"531",5965,"indifferently away and looked about the sky as though in search of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"532",5965,"other sights. In doing so, he leaned over the deck's railing; and","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"533",5965,"Smith saw the sheer sides of the giant ship, extending fore and aft","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"534",5965,"almost indefinitely; while far overhead billowed vast clouds of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"535",5965,"white cloth. The vessel was now under sail.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"536",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"537",5965,"About a mile higher up, and almost that distance to one side, the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"538",5965,"agent's eyes made out two tiny specks. He watched them closely for a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"539",5965,"moment as they pitched and tossed queerly about; then darted into","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"540",5965,"the engine-room, secured a pair of binoculars of an old, squat","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"541",5965,"pattern, and swiftly focused upon the nearer of the two.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"542",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"543",5965,"Smith instantly sensed a disaster. The object was a small air-craft,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"544",5965,"of a sort entirely strange to the engineer; yet he knew that it was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"545",5965,"disabled. One of its queer wings was broken and fluttering, as the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"546",5965,"little machine dropped, tumbling and twisting erratically, in an","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"547",5965,"inexplicably slow fashion toward the unseen ground. Smith glimpsed a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"548",5965,"single figure, presumably strapped in the seat.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"549",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"550",5965,"Then the focus changed to cover the other machine. It was of the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"551",5965,"same type; and Smith saw that it was swooping in a steep spiral, its","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"552",5965,"driver leaning over in his seat, looking down.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"553",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"554",5965,"Next moment the two were in focus together. Every second they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"555",5965,"dropped closer and closer to Smith's borrowed eyes. And in less time","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"556",5965,"than it takes to tell it, they had come so close that when the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"557",5965,"occupant of the disabled craft lurched heavily to one side, Smith","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2457",5965,"have been called ""westerly"" on the earth; and during the time they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2458",5965,"were above land, Billie saw no sign of factories, farms, or other","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2459",5965,"forms of industry. In fact, hill and valley alike were laid out with","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2460",5965,"handsome residences, beautifully kept grounds, vast parks and","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2461",5965,"extensive greens, suggesting golf. That was all.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2462",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2463",5965,"Then she noticed something that made her marvel. The sun, which had","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2465",5965,"three hours began to descend with increasing rapidity; so that in","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2466",5965,"half the length of an ordinary afternoon it had approached to within","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2470",5965,"Soon Billie concluded that the two fliers were bound for the bottom","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2471",5965,"of some unusually wide and exceptionally deep canon. She tried to","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2472",5965,"remember what she had read of the earth's greatest chasms; was it","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2473",5965,"possible for the sun to disappear in mid-afternoon in such? And yet","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2474",5965,"the flight went on and on, until Billie began to wonder if a chasm","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2476",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2478",5965,"fliers were steadily approaching this, and all the time going deeper","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2479",5965,"and deeper. Once Mona turned her eyes searching to the right and","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2480",5965,"left; whereupon Billie was still further mystified to see that,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2487",5965,"semidarkness, a heavy growth of vegetation on the opposite wall.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2501",5965,"Were they entering some sort of a cave? If so, it had dimensions","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2535",5965,"foliage much like ferns. Here and there, however, was a small","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2536",5965,"flowering shrub; and it was to one of these that a tiny,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2545",5965,"and watching the two with bright, unfrightened eyes. But Mona was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"2546",5965,"not much interested; she and Fort moved on. And shortly Billie was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"2553",5965,"meaning of it? Billie began to wonder if ""the contact"" was the name","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4559",5965,"too full of nuts. She merely nodded in the direction of Cunora.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4564",5965,"approached; her eyes sparkled mischievously and, the doctor thought,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4565",5965,"somewhat affectionately. Dulnop made a sudden darting move toward","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4566",5965,"her branch, and she as swiftly whirled in her tracks, so that he","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4567",5965,"missed. However, he instantly changed his mind and grasped the girl","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4568",5965,"instead. Like a flash he drew her to him and kissed her noisily.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4578",5965,"it was in a deep, contralto voice which gave the impression of riper","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4580",5965,"Rolla was nearly ten years their senior, a somewhat more lithe","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4583",5965,"As seen reflected in pools of water, her complexion was slightly","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4585",5965,"distinctively philosophical. To those who admire serious, thoughtful","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4586",5965,"women of regular feature and different manner, Rolla would have","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4596",5965,"up as a bad job. ""Tell me whence cameth the nuts, Cunora!"" he","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4597",5965,"begged; but the girl pretended to be cross, and shut her mouth as","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4601",5965,"crashing sound; and shortly the fourth Sanusian appeared. He was by","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4602",5965,"far the larger; but his size was a matter of width rather than of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4603",5965,"height. An artist would have picked him as a model for Ajax himself.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4604",5965,"His muscles fairly strained the huge lion's skin in which he was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4605",5965,"clad, and he had twice the weight of Dulnop within the same height.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4606",5965,"Also, to the doctor's eye, he was nearer Rolla's age.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4607",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4608",5965,"His face was strong and handsome in a somewhat fierce, relentless","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4609",5965,"way; his complexion darker than the rest. He carried a huge club,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4610",5965,"such as must have weighed all of forty pounds, while his belt was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4611",5965,"jammed full of stone weapons. The doctor classed him and the younger","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4617",5965,"baritone. He strode forward with scarcely a glance at the two","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4618",5965,"younger people; his gaze was fixed upon Rolla, his expression","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4619",5965,"unmistakable. The woman quietly turned upon Dulnop and Cunora.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4624",5965,"the big man had seized Rolla, crushed her to his breast and kissed","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4625",5965,"her passionately. She responded just as warmly, pushing him away","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4626",5965,"only in order to avoid being seen by the others. They showed only an","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4631",5965,"However, it was not so easy to analyze certain things that were said","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4632",5965,"during the time the four Sanusians spent in each other's company.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4645",5965,"indicate, another type of creature, entirely different from the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4646",5965,"humans, and yet, because of the peculiar Sanusian conditions,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4655",5965,"These four skin-clad savages seemed to be enjoying an aboriginal","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4656",5965,"picnic. For lunch, they munched on various fruits and nuts picked up","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4657",5965,"en route, together with handfuls of some wheatlike cereal which the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4658",5965,"big man had brought in a goatskin. From time to time they scared out","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4659",5965,"various animals from the brush, chasing the creatures after the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4660",5965,"fashion of dogs and children. Whenever they came to a stream,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4671",5965,"learned that day was the strange mariner in which the excursion came","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4672",5965,"to an end. The quartet was at that moment climbing a small hill,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4673",5965,"apparently on the edge of an extensive range of mountains. An","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4678",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4679",5965,"The hill was placed on one edge of a valley about forty miles in","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4745",5965,"Immediately upon going into tele-consciousness Smith became aware of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4746",5965,"a decided change in his surroundings. The interior of the study had","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4748",5965,"exposed to the most intense sunlight. The first sight that he got,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4749",5965,"in fact, was directed toward the sky; and he noted with an","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4750",5965,"engineer's keen interest that the color of the sky was blue,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4751",5965,"slightly tinged with orange. This, he knew, meant that the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4752",5965,"atmosphere of Sanus contained at least one chemical element which is","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4754",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4755",5965,"For a minute or two the sky remained entirely clear. There were no","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4756",5965,"clouds whatever; neither did any form of winged life make its","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4757",5965,"appearance. So Smith took note of sounds.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4758",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4759",5965,"Presumably his agent--whoever or whatever it might be--was located","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4760",5965,"in some sort of aircraft; for an extremely loud and steady buzzing,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4761",5965,"suggesting a powerful engine, filled the engineer's borrowed ears.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4762",5965,"Try as he might, however, he could not identify the sound exactly.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4763",5965,"It was more like an engine than anything else, except that the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4764",5965,"separate sounds which comprised the buzz occurred infinitely close","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4765",5965,"together. Smith concluded that the machine was some highly developed","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4766",5965,"rotary affair, working at perhaps six or eight thousand revolutions","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4770",5965,"something arrived in the field of vision; a blurred speck, far to","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4771",5965,"one side. It approached leisurely, with the unknown agent watching","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4772",5965,"steadfastly. It still remained blurred, however; for a long time the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4773",5965,"engineer knew as little about its actual form as he knew about his","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4776",5965,"Then, like a flash, the vision cleared. All the blurring disappeared","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4777",5965,"instantly, and the form of a buzzard was disclosed. It was almost","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4778",5965,"directly overhead, about a quarter of a mile distant, and soaring in","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4779",5965,"a wide spiral. No sound whatever came from it. Smith's agent made no","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4782",5965,"Shortly the buzzard ""banked"" for a sharper turn; and the engineer","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4783",5965,"saw, by the perspective of its apparent speed, that the aircraft","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4784",5965,"whose use he was enjoying was likewise on the move. Apparently it","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4785",5965,"was flying in a straight line, keeping the sun--an object vastly too","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4786",5965,"brilliant to examine--on the right.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4787",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4788",5965,"The buzzard went out of sight. Once more the clear sky was all that","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4789",5965,"could be seen; that, and the continual roar of the engine, were all","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4790",5965,"that Smith actually knew. He became impatient for his agent to look","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4791",5965,"elsewhere; it might be that the craft contained other specimens of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4792",5965,"the unknown creatures. But there was no change in the vigilant watch","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4793",5965,"which was being kept upon the sky.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4794",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4795",5965,"Suddenly the engineer became exceedingly alert. He had noticed","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4796",5965,"something new--something so highly different from anything he had","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4797",5965,"expected to learn that it was some minutes before he could believe","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4799",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4800",5965,"His borrowed eyes had no eyelids! At least, if they did, they were","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4801",5965,"never used. Not once did they flicker in the slightest; not once did","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4802",5965,"they blink or wink, much less close themselves for a momentary rest","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4803",5965,"from the sun's glare. They remained as stonily staring as the eyes","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4804",5965,"of a marble statue.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4805",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4806",5965,"Then something startling happened. With the most sickening","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4807",5965,"suddenness the aircraft came to an abrupt halt. Smith's senses swam","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4808",5965,"with the jolt of it. All about him was a confused jumble of blurred","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4809",5965,"figures and forms; it was infinitely worse than his first ride in a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4810",5965,"hoist. In a moment, however, he was able to examine things fairly","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4811",5965,"well.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4812",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4813",5965,"The aircraft had come to a stop in the middle of what looked like a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4814",5965,"cane brake. On all sides rose yellowish-green shafts, bearing leaves","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4815",5965,"characteristic of the maize family. Smith knew little about cane,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4816",5965,"yet felt sure that these specimens were a trifle large. ""Possibly","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4817",5965,"due to difference in gravitation,"" he thought.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4818",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4819",5965,"However, he could not tell much about the spot on which the machine","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4820",5965,"had landed. For a moment it was motionless; the engine had been","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4821",5965,"stopped, and all was silent except for the gentle rustling of the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4822",5965,"cane in the field. The unknown operator did not change his position","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4823",5965,"in the slightest.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4824",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4825",5965,"Then the craft began to move over the surface, in a jerky, lurching","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4826",5965,"fashion which indicated a very rough piece of ground. At the same","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4827",5965,"time a queer, leathery squeaking came to the engineer's borrowed","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4828",5965,"ears; he concluded that the machine was being sorely strained by the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4829",5965,"motion. At the time he was puzzled to account for the motion itself.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4830",5965,"Either there was another occupant of the craft, who had climbed out","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4831",5965,"and was now pushing the thing along the ground, or else some form of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4832",5965,"silent mechanism was operating the wheels upon which, presumably,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4833",5965,"the craft was mounted. Shortly the motion stopped altogether.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4834",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4835",5965,"It was then that Smith noticed something he had so far ignored","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4836",5965,"because he knew his own dinner hour was approaching. His agent was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4837",5965,"hungry, like himself. He noticed it because, just then, he received","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4838",5965,"a very definite impression of the opposite feeling; the agent was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4839",5965,"eating lunch of some sort, and enjoying it. There was no doubt about","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4840",5965,"this. All that Smith could do was to wish, for the hundredth time,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4841",5965,"that he could look around a little and see what was being eaten, and","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4842",5965,"how.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4843",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4844",5965,"The meal occupied several minutes. Not once did the strange occupant","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4845",5965,"of that machine relax his stony stare at the sky, and Smith tried to","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4846",5965,"forget how hungry he was by estimating the extent of his vision. He","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4847",5965,"decided that the angle subtended about a hundred and sixty degrees,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4848",5965,"or almost half a circle; and he further concluded that if his agent","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4849",5965,"possessed a nose, it was a pretty trifling affair, too small to be","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4850",5965,"noticed. It was obvious, too, that the fellow's mouth was located","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4851",5965,"much lower in the face than normal. He ate without showing a single","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4852",5965,"particle of food, and did it very quietly.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4853",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4854",5965,"At length hunger was satisfied. There was complete stillness and","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4855",5965,"silence for a moment, then another short lurching journey through","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4856",5965,"the cane; and next, with an abruptness that made the engineer's","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4857",5965,"senses swim again, the fellow once more took to the air. The speed","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4858",5965,"with which he ""got away"" was enough to make a motorcyclist, doing","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4859",5965,"his best, seem to stand still.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4860",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4861",5965,"It took time for Smith to regain his balance. When he did, the same","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4862",5965,"unbroken expanse of sky once more met his gaze; but it was not long","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4863",5965,"until, out of the corners of those unblinking eyes, he could make","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4864",5965,"out bleary forms which shortly resolved themselves into mountain","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4865",5965,"tops. It was odd, the way things suddenly flashed into full view.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4866",5965,"One second they would be blurred and unrecognizable; the next,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4867",5965,"sharply outlined and distinct as anything the engineer had ever","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4868",5965,"seen. Yet, there seemed to be no change in the focus of those eyes.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4869",5965,"It wasn't as though they were telescopic, either. Not until long","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4870",5965,"afterward did Smith understand the meaning of this.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4871",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4872",5965,"The mountains grew higher and nearer. Before long it seemed as","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4873",5965,"though the aircraft was entering some sort of a canon. Its sides","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4874",5965,"were only sparsely covered with vegetation, and all of it was quite","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4875",5965,"brown, as though the season were autumn. For the most part the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4876",5965,"surface was of broken rock and boulders.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4877",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4878",5965,"Within a space of three or four minutes the engineer counted not","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4879",5965,"less than ten buzzards. The unknown operator of the machine,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4880",5965,"however, paid no attention to them, but continued his extraordinary","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4881",5965,"watch of the heavens. Smith began to wonder if the chap were not","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4882",5965,"seated in an air-tight, sound-proof chamber, deep in the hull of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4883",5965,"some great aerial cruiser, with his eyes glued fast to a periscope.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4886",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4887",5965,"And then came another of those terrifying stops. This time, as soon","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4888",5965,"as he could collect his senses, the engineer saw that the machine","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4889",5965,"had landed approximately in the middle of the canon, and presumably","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4890",5965,"among the boulders in its bottom. For all about it were the tops of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4891",5965,"gigantic rocks, most of them worn smooth from water action. And, as","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4892",5965,"soon as the engine stopped, Smith plainly heard the roar of water","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4894",5965,"wonder didn't the fellow look down, for a change?","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4895",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4896",5965,"The craft began to move. This time its motion was smoother arguing","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4897",5965,"an even surface. However, it had not gone far before, to the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4898",5965,"engineer's astonishment, it began to move straight down a slope so","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4899",5965,"steep that no mechanism with which Smith was familiar could possibly","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4900",5965,"have clung to it. As this happened, his adopted eyes told him that","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4901",5965,"the craft was located upon one of those enormous boulders, in the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4902",5965,"center of a stream of such absolute immensity that he fairly gasped.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4909",5965,"vision was now upon a similar boulder seemingly a quarter of a mile","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4910",5965,"distant, farther out in the stream. But the fellow at the periscope","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4913",5965,"It was so unreal. Smith deliberately ignored everything else and","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4916",5965,"vibration, which indicated the agent's heart-action. Apparently it","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4920",5965,"living being. For a moment he had fancied something utterly","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"4921",5965,"repellent to him. Suppose this Sanusian were not any form of natural","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4923",5965,"functioning like an organism? The thought made the engineer shudder","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"4929",5965,"brownish blur could be made out. Once he caught a queer sound above","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7066",5965,"vegetation of some sort, and wherever there was vegetation bees were","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7069",5965,"Moreover, both suffered keenly for want of cereals, to which they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7070",5965,"were accustomed; they were heartily tired of such fruits and nuts as","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7077",5965,"little brush; and with every step the rockiness increased. By dawn","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7093",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7094",5965,"A large drone passed within six feet of them. Both heard the buzz,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7101",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7102",5965,"The two sped over the rocks, making pretty good time considering the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7103",5965,"loads they carried. Each had a good-sized goatskin full of various","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7104",5965,"dried fruits and nuts, also a gourd not so full. In fact, it had","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7105",5965,"been some while since they had had fresh water. Cunora was further","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7106",5965,"weighed down by some six pounds of dried rabbit meat; the animals","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7107",5965,"had been caught in snares. Both, however, discarded their palm","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7110",5965,"And thus they fled, knowing that they had, at most, less than a day","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7111",5965,"before the drone would return with enough soldiers to compel","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7112",5965,"obedience. For the most part, the surface was rough granite, with","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7113",5965,"very little sign of erosion. There was almost no water; both women","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7114",5965,"showed intense joy when they found a tiny pool of it standing in a","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7116",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7117",5965,"A few steps farther on, and the pair stepped out of the shallow","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7118",5965,"gully in which they had been walking. Immediately they were exposed","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7119",5965,"to a very strong and exceedingly cold wind, such as seemed to","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7120",5965,"surprise them in no way, but compelled both to actually lean against","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7121",5965,"its force. Moreover, although this pressure was all from the left,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7122",5965,"it proved exceedingly difficult to go on. Their legs seemed made of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7123",5965,"lead, and their breathing was strangely labored. This, also,","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7124",5965,"appeared to be just what they had expected.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7125",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7126",5965,"Presently, however, they found another slight depression in the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7127",5965,"rocks; and sheltered from the wind, made a little better progress","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7128",5965,"ahead. It was bitter cold, however; only the violence of their","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7129",5965,"exercise could make them warm enough to stand it. All in all, the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7130",5965,"two were considerably over three hours in making the last mile; they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7131",5965,"had to stop frequently to rest. The only compensating thing was","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7132",5965,"their freedom from worry; the bees would not bother them where the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7133",5965,"wind was so strong. So long as they could keep on the move they were","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7134",5965,"safe.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7135",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7136",5965,"But what made it worse was the steadily increasing difficulty of","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7137",5965,"moving their legs. For, although the surface continued level, they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7138",5965,"seemed to be CLIMBING now, where before they had simply walked. It","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7139",5965,"was just as though the plateau had changed into a mountain, and they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7140",5965,"were ascending it; only, upon looking back, nothing but","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7141",5965,"comparatively flat rock met the gaze. What made them lean forward so","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7145",5965,"about the wind, to which they had become once more exposed as they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7146",5965,"reached the end of the rift. On they pressed, five or six steps at","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7147",5965,"each attempt, stopping to rest twice the length of time they","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7148",5965,"actually traveled. It was necessary now to cling to the rock with","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7149",5965,"both hands, and once Cunora lost her grip, so that she would have","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7150",5965,"been blown to one side, or else have slipped backward, had not Rolla","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7151",5965,"grasped her heel and held her until she could get another hand-hold.","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7154",5965,"despite the bitter cold of the wind; her hands trembled from the","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7155",5965,"strain she was undergoing. ""Courage, Cunora! It be not much","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7160",5965,"argued obstinately against this. Also, the sun remained in the same","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7161",5965,"position relative to the rocks; if they were climbing, it should","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7169",5965,"","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7642",5965,"then he cogitated a moment, wet his lips and said something that","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7689",5965,"from hand-painted china of the finest quality, and using silverware","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"

"7696",5965,"small-grained corn on the cob, a yellowish root-vegetable not unlike","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7697",5965,"turnips, and large quantities of berries. She was too hungry to be","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
"7698",5965,"particular, and ate heartily of all that was offered, whether cooked","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix","Flint, Homer Eon","Science Fiction","en"
