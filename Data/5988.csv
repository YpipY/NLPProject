"1480",5988,"put him to reason many times and blamed him much in that he gave not his","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1530",5988,"never have her.”  “Yea, but have her he shall, dame,” said the knight,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1533",5988,"that, she was much sorry, and said to her lord that Robin should have her","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1534",5988,"never.  “Nay, dame,” said the lord, “have her he shall, wilt thou or wilt","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1545",5988,"neck herein.”  “Nay? alas, then!” said the dame, “so shall my heart never","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1546",5988,"have joy if I lose my fair daughter.  At least, fair lords, I pray you","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1547",5988,"that ye show him that if he does thus he will neither do well nor","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1548",5988,"according to his honour.”  “Dame,” say they, “this setting forth will we","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1550",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1551",5988,"So they came unto the knight, and when they had showed him their business","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1552",5988,"he answered them right courteously: “Fair lords, I will tell you what I","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1553",5988,"will do for the love of you; if it please you I will put off the wedding","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1554",5988,"in this wise as I shall tell you; to wit: Amongst you ye be rich and of","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1555",5988,"great lands; ye are nigh friends of my fair daughter, whom I love much.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1556",5988,"If ye will give her four hundred pounds of land I will set aside the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1557",5988,"wedding, and she shall be wedded elsewhere according to your counsel.”","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1558",5988,"“A-God’s name,” quoth they, “we be nought fain to lay down so much.”","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1559",5988,"“Well, then,” said the knight, “since ye will not do this, then suffer me","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1560",5988,"to do with my daughter as I list.”  “Sir, with a good will,” said they.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1561",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1562",5988,"So the knight sent for his chaplain, and brought thither his fair","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1563",5988,"daughter, and let affiance her to Robin, and set a day for the wedding.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1564",5988,"But the third day thereafter, Robin spake to his lord, and prayed him","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1565",5988,"make him a knight, whereas it was nought meet that he should take to him","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1566",5988,"so high a wife and so fair before he was a knight.  His lord had great","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1567",5988,"joy thereof, and the next day he was made knight, and the third day","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1568",5988,"wedded the fair maiden with great feast and joyance.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1569",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1570",5988,"But when master Robin was made knight he spake thus to his lord: “Sir, ye","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1571",5988,"have made me knight; and true it is that against the peril of death I","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1572",5988,"vowed me to the road unto Saint Jamesward on the morrow of my knighting;","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1573",5988,"wherefore I pray thee take it not in dudgeon if to-morrow morn I must","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1574",5988,"needs go my ways so soon as I shall have wedded thy fair daughter;","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1575",5988,"whereas in nowise will I break mine oath.”  “Forsooth, master Robin, if","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1576",5988,"thou leave thus my fair daughter and thus wise go your ways, ye shall be","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1577",5988,"much to blame.”  “Sir,” said he, “I shall come back right soon if God","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1578",5988,"will; but this wayfaring I needs must perforce.”  Whenas a certain knight","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1579",5988,"of the court of the lord heard these words he blamed Sir Robin much,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1580",5988,"whereas he was leaving his fair wife at such a point, and Sir Robin said","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1581",5988,"that he needs must do it.  “Certes,” said the knight, who had to name","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1582",5988,"Raoul, “if thou goest thus to Saint James without touching thy fair wife,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1583",5988,"I will make thee cuckold before thine home-coming, and when thou comest","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1584",5988,"home I will give thee good tokens that I have had share of her.  Now I","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1585",5988,"will lay my land thereto against thine, which our lord hath given thee,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1586",5988,"for I have well four hundred pounds of land even as thou hast.”","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1587",5988,"“Forsooth,” said Sir Robin, “my wife is not come of such blood as that","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1588",5988,"she shall misdo against me, and I may not believe in it nowise: I will","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1589",5988,"make the wager with thee, if it please thee.”  “Yea,” said Sir Raoul,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1590",5988,"“wilt thou pledge thee thereto?”  “Yea, verily,” said Sir Robin, “and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1591",5988,"thou?”  “Yea, and I also.  Now go we to my lord and make record of our","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1592",5988,"covenant.”  “That will I well,” said Sir Robin.  Therewith they go unto","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1593",5988,"the lord, and the wager was recorded, and they pledged them to hold","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1594",5988,"thereto.  On the morrow betimes Sir Robin wedded the fair maiden, and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1595",5988,"straightway after mass was said, he departed from the house and left the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1596",5988,"wedding, and took the road for St. Jakem.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1597",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1598",5988,"But now leaveth the tale to tell of him and telleth of Sir Raoul, who was","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1599",5988,"in great imagination how he might win his wager and lie by the fair lady.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1600",5988,"And saith the tale that the lady held her much simply while her lord was","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1601",5988,"on pilgrimage, and was going to the minster with a good will, and prayed","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1602",5988,"God that he would bring back her lord.  But Sir Raoul pained him on the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1603",5988,"other hand how he might win his wager, for great doubt he had to lose his","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1604",5988,"land.  He spake with the carline who dwelt with the fair lady, and said","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1605",5988,"to her, that if she could so bring it about that she might set him in","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1606",5988,"place and at point that he might speak privily with my lady Jehane, and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1607",5988,"have his will of her, he would give her much good, so that there would be","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1608",5988,"no hour when she should not be rich.  “Sir, forsooth,” said the carline,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1609",5988,"“thou art so fair a knight, and so wise and courteous that my lady should","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1610",5988,"well ought to love thee par amours, and I will put myself to the pain","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1611",5988,"herein to the utmost of my might.”  Then the knight drew out straightway","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1612",5988,"a forty sols, and gave it to her to buy a gown.  The carline took them","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1613",5988,"with a goodwill, and set them away surely, and said that she would speak","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1614",5988,"with the lady.  The knight departed from the carline, and the carline","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1615",5988,"abode and took her lady to task when she came back from the minster, and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1616",5988,"said to her: “In God’s name, lady, tell me true!  My lord, when he went","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1617",5988,"to Saint Jakem, had he ever lain by thee?”  “Wherefore dost thou say","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1618",5988,"this, dame Hersent?”  “Lady, because I trow that thou be yet a clean","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1619",5988,"maid.”  “Certes, dame Hersent, so am I verily; for of no woman wot I who","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1620",5988,"would do such a deed.”  “Lady,” said dame Hersent, “great damage it is;","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1621",5988,"for if ye wotted how great is the joy that women have when they be with a","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1622",5988,"man who loveth them, ye would say that there is no joy so great; and for","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1623",5988,"this cause I marvel much that ye love not par amours even as these other","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1624",5988,"ladies who all love.  But if it pleaseth thee the matter is ready to","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1625",5988,"hand; whereas I wot of a knight, fair and valiant and wise, who will love","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1626",5988,"thee with a good will; a much rich man is he, and fairer by far than the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1627",5988,"coward recreant who hath left thee.  And if ye dare love ye may have","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1628",5988,"whatso ye dare ask; and so much joy shall ye have as never lady had","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1629",5988,"more.”  So much spake the carline by her words that the needle of nature","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1630",5988,"stirred somewhat.  The lady asked who the knight might be.  “Who is it,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1631",5988,"lady?  A-God’s name!  I may well name him.  It is the lovely, the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1632",5988,"valiant, the hardy Sir Raoul, who is one of the mesney of thy father; the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1633",5988,"kindest heart men wot of.”  “Dame Hersent,” said the lady, “thou wert","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1634",5988,"best let such words be; for I have no desire to misdo of my body, of no","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1635",5988,"such blood am I come.”  “Dame,” said the carline, “I wot well.  But never","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1636",5988,"shalt thou know the worthy joy when a man wendeth with a woman.”","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1637",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1638",5988,"Thuswise abode the matter.  Sir Raoul came back to the carline, and she","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1639",5988,"told him how she had talked with the lady, and what she had answered.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1640",5988,"“Dame Hersent,” said the knight, “thus wise should a good lady answer;","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1641",5988,"but ye shall speak with her again, for one doeth not the business at the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1642",5988,"first stroke: and hold, here be twenty sols to buy thee a cloth to thy","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1643",5988,"surcoat.”  The carline took the silver, and spake with the lady often,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1644",5988,"but nought it availed.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1897",5988,"make money thereby: for I am the best of bakers that ye may wot of; and I","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1898",5988,"will make French bread, and I doubt me not but I shall earn my spending","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1909",5988,"according to thy will, for I grant it thee, and moreover I praise thee","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1925",5988,"betook him to the road with three squires: and went so much by his","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1926",5988,"journeys that he came into Marseilles-on-sea and took lodging in the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1927",5988,"French hostel, whereas dwelt Sir Robin and John.  So soon as John saw him","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1928",5988,"she knew him by the scar of the wound she had made him, and because she","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1929",5988,"had seen him many times.  The knight sojourned in the town fifteen days,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1930",5988,"and hired him passage.  But the while he sojourned, John drew him in to","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1931",5988,"privy talk, and asked of him the occasion of his going over sea, and Sir","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1937",5988,"and did his pilgrimage, and confessed him the best he might: and his","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1938",5988,"confessor charged him in penance that he should give back the land which","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1939",5988,"he held wrongfully to the knight and his wife.  Whereon he said to his","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1940",5988,"confessor, that when he came into his own country he would do what his","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1942",5988,"dight his passage as one who had great longing to repair to his own","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1952",5988,"his chaplain took him to task, and asked of him if any had demanded the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1953",5988,"occasion of his journey; and he said: “Yea, in three places, to wit:","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1954",5988,"Marseilles, Acre, and Jerusalem: and he of whom I took counsel bade me to","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1955",5988,"give back the land to Sir Robin, if I hear tidings of him, or to his wife","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2516",5988,"saw the stroke a-coming, and if he doubted thereof, no marvel was it; but","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2517",5988,"he swerved from the stroke as best he might, and that one missed him; and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2518",5988,"as he passed by him Messire Thibault threw himself under the glaive, and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2519",5988,"took it from the strong thief, and bestirred him against those three","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2520",5988,"whence that one was come, and smote one of them amidst the body, and slew","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2521",5988,"him; and thereafter turned about, and went back, and smote him who had","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2522",5988,"first come on him amidst of the body, and slew him.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2523",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2524",5988,"Now it pleased God that of the eight strong-thieves he slew three, and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2525",5988,"the other five encompassed him, and slew his palfrey, so that he fell","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2526",5988,"adown on his back without any wound to grieve him: he had neither sword","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2527",5988,"nor any other armour to help him.  So the strong-thieves took his raiment","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2528",5988,"from him, all to his shirt, and his spurs and shoon; and then they took a","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2529",5988,"sword-belt, and bound his hands and his feet, and cast him into a","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2530",5988,"bramble-bush much sharp and much rough.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2531",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2532",5988,"And when they had thus done, they came to the Lady, and took from her her","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2533",5988,"palfrey and all her raiment, right to her smock; and she was much fair,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2534",5988,"and she was weeping tenderly, and much and of great manner was she","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2535",5988,"sorrowful.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2536",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2537",5988,"Then one of the strong-thieves beheld her, and said thus to his fellows:","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2538",5988,"“Masters, I have lost my brother in this stour, therefore will I have","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2539",5988,"this Lady in atonement thereof.”  Another said: “But I also, I have lost","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2540",5988,"my cousin-german; therefore I claim as much as thou herein: yea, and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2541",5988,"another such right have I.”  And even in such wise said the third and the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2542",5988,"fourth and the fifth; but at last said one: “In the holding of this Lady","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2543",5988,"ye have no great getting nor gain; so let us lead her into the forest","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2544",5988,"here, and do our will on her, and then set her on the road again and let","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2545",5988,"her go.”  So did they even as they had devised, and set her on the road","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2546",5988,"again.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2547",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2548",5988,"Messire Thibault saw it well, and much sorrowful he was, but nought might","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2549",5988,"he do against it; nor none ill will had he against the Lady for that","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2550",5988,"which had befallen her; for he wotted well that it had been perforce and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2551",5988,"against the will of her.  The Lady was much sorrowful, and all ashamed.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2552",5988,"So Messire Thibault called to her and said: “Dame, for God’s sake come","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2553",5988,"hither and unbind me, and deliver me from the grief wherein I am; for","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2555",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2556",5988,"So the Lady went whereas lay Messire Thibault, and espied a sword lying","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2557",5988,"behind there of one of the strong-thieves who had been slain.  So she","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2558",5988,"took it, and went toward her lord, full of great ire and evil will of","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2559",5988,"that which was befallen.  For she doubted much that he would have her in","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2560",5988,"despite for that he had seen her thus, and that he would reprove her one","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2561",5988,"while and lay before her what had her betid.  She said: “Sir, I will","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2563",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2564",5988,"Therewith she hove up the sword and came to her lord, and thought to","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2565",5988,"smite him amidst of the body; and when he saw the stroke coming he","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2566",5988,"doubted it much, for he was all naked to his shirt and breeches, and no","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2567",5988,"more.  Therefore so hardly he quaked, that the hands and the fingers of","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2568",5988,"him; were sundered; and in such wise she smote him that she but hurt him","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2569",5988,"a little, and sheared the thongs wherewith he was bound; and when he felt","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2570",5988,"the bonds slacken, he drew to him and brake the thongs, and leapt to his","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2571",5988,"feet, and said: “Dame, so please God, no more to-day shalt thou slay me.”","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2572",5988,"But she said: “Of a surety, sir, I am heavy thereof.”","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2573",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2574",5988,"He took the sword of her, and put it back into the scabbard, and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2575",5988,"thereafter laid his hand on her shoulder, and brought her back on the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2576",5988,"road whereby they had come.  And when he came to the entry of the wood,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2577",5988,"there found he a great part of his company, which was come to meet him","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2578",5988,"and when they saw them thus naked, they asked of him: “Sir, who hath thus","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2579",5988,"arrayed you?”  But he told them that they had fallen in with","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2580",5988,"strong-thieves, who had thus ensnared them.  Much great dole they made","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2581",5988,"thereof; but speedily were they clad and arrayed, for they had well","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2582",5988,"enough thereto so they gat to horse and went their ways.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2584",5988,"That day they rode, and for nought that had befallen Messire Thibault","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2585",5988,"made no worser semblance unto the Lady.  That night they came unto a good","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2586",5988,"town, and there they harboured.  Messire Thibault asked of his host if","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2587",5988,"there were any house of religion anigh thereto, where one might leave a","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2588",5988,"lady, and the host said: “Sir, it befalleth well to thee; hard by without","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2590",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2591",5988,"Wore the night, and Messire Thibault went on the morrow into that house","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2592",5988,"and heard mass, and thereafter spake to the abbess, and the convent, and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2593",5988,"prayed them that they would guard that Lady there till his coming back;","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2594",5988,"and they granted it to him much willingly.  Messire Thibault left of his","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2595",5988,"meney there to serve the Lady, and went his ways, and did his pilgrimage","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2596",5988,"the best he might.  And when he had done his pilgrimage fair and well, he","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2597",5988,"returned, and came to the Lady.  He did good to the house, and gave","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2598",5988,"thereto of his havings, and took the Lady unto him again, and led her","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2599",5988,"into his country with as much great honour as he had led her away, save","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2601",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2602",5988,"When he was gotten aback into his land, much great joy did they make of","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2603",5988,"him, and of the Lady.  At his homecoming was the Count of Ponthieu, the","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2604",5988,"father of the Lady, and there also was the Count of St. Pol, who was","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2605",5988,"uncle unto my lord Thibault.  A many was there of good folk and valiant","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2606",5988,"at their coming.  The Lady was much honoured of dames and of damsels.","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2608",5988,"That day the Count of Ponthieu sat, he and Messire Thibault, they two","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2609",5988,"together, at one dish, and so it fell out that the Count said to him:","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2610",5988,"“Thibault, fair son, he who long way wendeth heareth much, and seeth of","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2611",5988,"adventures, whereof nought they know who stir not; tell me tale, then, if","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2612",5988,"it please thee, of some matter which thou hast seen, or heard tell of,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2614",5988,"","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2615",5988,"Messire Thibault answered him that he knew of no adventure to tell of;","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2616",5988,"but the Count prayed him again, and tormented him thereto, and held him","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2617",5988,"sore to tell of some adventure, insomuch that Messire Thibault answered","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2618",5988,"him: “Sir, since tell I needs must, I will tell thee; but so please thee,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2619",5988,"let it not be within earshot of so much folk.”  The Count answered and","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2620",5988,"said that it so pleased him well.  So after dinner, whenas they had","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2871",5988,"After dinner came the Saracens unto the Soudan, and said to him: “Sir, we","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2872",5988,"require of thee our right.”  He asked them what it was, and they said:","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2873",5988,"“Sir, a captive Christian to set up at the butts.”  So he granted it to","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2884",5988,"led to the death, and so soon as she saw him, the blood and the heart was","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2885",5988,"stirred within her, not so much for that she knew him, but rather that","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2886",5988,"nature constrained her.  Then said the Lady to the Soudan: “Sir, I am","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2887",5988,"French, wherefore I would willingly speak to yonder poor man before he","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2917",5988,"Lady came to Messire Thibault, and asked him of whence he was, and he","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2953",5988,"friendship.  And the Count, who was right sage, asked thereon: “Dame,","Old French Romances, Done into English","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
