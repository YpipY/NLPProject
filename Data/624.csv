"1720",624,"passing before my mind concerned a generation long, long ago mouldered","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1722",624,"my temples with all my might between my hands to keep them from","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1731",624,"associations of thought, ideas of persons and things, all had dissolved","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1732",624,"and lost coherence and were seething together in apparently","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1743",624,"least the diversion of physical exertion. I sprang up, and, hastily","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1744",624,"dressing, opened the door of my room and went down-stairs. The hour was","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1745",624,"very early, it being not yet fairly light, and I found no one in the","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1746",624,"lower part of the house. There was a hat in the hall, and, opening the","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1748",624,"burglary was not among the perils of the modern Boston, I found myself","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1749",624,"on the street. For two hours I walked or ran through the streets of the","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1753",624,"appreciate what a series of bewildering surprises I underwent during","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1754",624,"that time. Viewed from the house-top the day before, the city had","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1755",624,"indeed appeared strange to me, but that was only in its general aspect.","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1756",624,"How complete the change had been I first realized now that I walked the","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1757",624,"streets. The few old landmarks which still remained only intensified","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1758",624,"this effect, for without them I might have imagined myself in a foreign","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1759",624,"town. A man may leave his native city in childhood, and return fifty","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1760",624,"years later, perhaps, to find it transformed in many features. He is","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1761",624,"astonished, but he is not bewildered. He is aware of a great lapse of","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1762",624,"time, and of changes likewise occurring in himself meanwhile. He but","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1763",624,"dimly recalls the city as he knew it when a child. But remember that","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1764",624,"there was no sense of any lapse of time with me. So far as my","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1765",624,"consciousness was concerned, it was but yesterday, but a few hours,","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1766",624,"since I had walked these streets in which scarcely a feature had","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1767",624,"escaped a complete metamorphosis. The mental image of the old city was","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1768",624,"so fresh and strong that it did not yield to the impression of the","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1769",624,"actual city, but contended with it, so that it was first one and then","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1770",624,"the other which seemed the more unreal. There was nothing I saw which","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1771",624,"was not blurred in this way, like the faces of a composite photograph.","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1772",624,"","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1773",624,"Finally, I stood again at the door of the house from which I had come","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1774",624,"out. My feet must have instinctively brought me back to the site of my","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1775",624,"old home, for I had no clear idea of returning thither. It was no more","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1776",624,"homelike to me than any other spot in this city of a strange","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1780",624,"had no object in entering, and turned away, but it yielded to my hand,","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1781",624,"and advancing with uncertain steps through the hall, I entered one of","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1782",624,"the apartments opening from it. Throwing myself into a chair, I covered","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1783",624,"my burning eyeballs with my hands to shut out the horror of","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1785",624,"nausea. The anguish of those moments, during which my brain seemed","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1786",624,"melting, or the abjectness of my sense of helplessness, how can I","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1789",624,"come. I heard the rustle of drapery, and looked up. Edith Leete was","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1790",624,"standing before me. Her beautiful face was full of the most poignant","Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
