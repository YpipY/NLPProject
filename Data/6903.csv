"21",6903,"springs of life send up sweet waters; joy is in the very air we breathe;","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"22",6903,"happiness seems our native element. During this period we know what is","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"23",6903,"the zest of living, as compared with the mere endurance of existence,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"24",6903,"which is, perhaps, the most we have attained to before or since. With men","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"25",6903,"this culminating epoch comes often in manhood, or even at maturity,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"26",6903,"especially with men of arduous and successful careers. But with women it","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"27",6903,"comes most frequently perhaps in girlhood and young womanhood.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"42",6903,"well-to-do, lived in the largest house in the place, and were regarded","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"43",6903,"somewhat as local magnates. Miss Ludington's childhood had been an","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"44",6903,"exceptionally happy one, and as a girl she had been the belle of the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"45",6903,"village. Her beauty, together, with her social position and amiability of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"46",6903,"disposition, made her the idol of the young men, recognised leader of the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"52",6903,"and for a long time lay between life and death. Or, to state the case","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"53",6903,"more accurately, the girl did die--it was a sad and faded woman who rose","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"58",6903,"replaced by a scanty growth of washed-out hue; the lips, but yesterday so","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"88",6903,"old happy days before her sickness. On this topic she was never weary of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"89",6903,"talking, but it was impossible to induce her to take any interest in the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"101",6903,"she took in these tributes to the charms of her girlish self was pathetic","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"139",6903,"completely ended. She found her only happiness in the recollections of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"140",6903,"that period which she retained. These were the only goods she prized, and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"155",6903,"score or two of old-fashioned dwellings, which had been the scene of her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"156",6903,"girlhood, was in a fair way to be transformed into a vile manufacturing","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"167",6903,"houses, and, where nothing more expensive could be afforded, the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"168",6903,"paint-brush wrought its cheap metamorphosis. ""You wouldn't know Hilton","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"173",6903,"irreparable loss, as one by one these changes effaced some souvenir of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"174",6903,"her early life. The past was once dead already; they were killing it a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"175",6903,"second time. Her feelings at length became so intolerable that she kept","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"184",6903,"of hot blood, could have been more overjoyed at the falling to him of a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"185",6903,"fortune than was this sad-faced old maid. She became smiling and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"186",6903,"animated. She no longer kept at home, but walked abroad. Her step was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"187",6903,"quick and strong; she looked on at the tree-choppers, the builders, and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"188",6903,"the painters, at their nefarious work, no more in helpless grief and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"782",6903,"one-roomed school-house on one side of the green, and the little white","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"785",6903,"As this scene burst upon Mrs. Slater's view, her bewilderment was amusing","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"786",6903,"to witness. Her appearance for a moment was really as if she believed","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"787",6903,"herself the victim of some sort of magic, and suspected her friend of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"788",6903,"being a sorceress. Reassured on this point by Miss Ludington's smiling","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"789",6903,"explanation, her astonishment gave place to the liveliest interest and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"790",6903,"curiosity. The carriage was forthwith stopped and sent around to the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"791",6903,"stables, while the two friends went on foot through the village. Every","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"792",6903,"house, every fence-corner, every lilac-bush or clump of hollyhocks, or","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"793",6903,"row of currant-bushes in the gardens, suggested some reminiscence, and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"794",6903,"the two old ladies were presently laughing and crying at once. At every","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"795",6903,"dwelling they lingered long, and went on reluctantly with many backward","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"796",6903,"glances, and all their speech was but a repetition of, ""Don't you","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"803",6903,"Ludington away; but new streets had been opened up, and the population of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"817",6903,"the long-silent laughter, and the voices, no more heard on earth, with","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"821",6903,"the one around whose red-hot sides they had shivered, in their short","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"947",6903,"reasonableness, and, indeed, that it was the only intelligible theory of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"975",6903,"added, ""I beg your pardon. Perhaps you are a spiritualist?""","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"979",6903,"may possibly be something in it, after all. Perhaps there may be, for","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"980",6903,"example, one part of truth to a hundred parts of fraud. I really don't","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"981",6903,"believe there is more. Now, as you think the mediums humbugs, and I am","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"982",6903,"sure most of them are, their failure to accomplish anything would not","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"983",6903,"shake your faith in your theory, and you would only have lost an evening","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"985",6903,"possibility--mind you, I think it is no more than that--a bare","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"986",6903,"possibility, say the smallest possible chance, but a chance--that you","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"994",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"995",6903,"""I don't suppose you would,"" replied Mrs. Slater. ""You would not need to;","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"996",6903,"but the money is something which I should have to consider, if it were my","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"997",6903,"case. The best materializing mediums charge pretty well. Mrs. Legrand,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"998",6903,"who I believe is considered the leading light just now, charges fifty","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"999",6903,"dollars for a private seance. Now, fifty dollars, I suppose, does not","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1001",6903,"like me to spend. And yet if I believed this wonderful thing that you","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1002",6903,"believe, and I thought there was one chance in a million that this woman","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1003",6903,"could demonstrate it to me by the assurance of sight, I would live on","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1007",6903,"twice, stood leaning his arm on the mantelpiece. He cleared his throat,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1023",6903,"distinguish his features and expression very plainly, and he seemed to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1024",6903,"recognize my friend. She said that it was her husband. Of course I know","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1025",6903,"nothing about that. I had never seen him alive. It may all have been a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1026",6903,"humbug, as I was prepared to believe it; but I assure you it was a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1027",6903,"curious business, and I haven't got over the impression which it made on","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1028",6903,"me, yet. I'm not given to believing in things that claim to be","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1029",6903,"supernatural, but I will admit that what I saw that night was very","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1030",6903,"strange. Humbug or no humbug, what she saw seemed to comfort my poor","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1031",6903,"friend more than all the religions or philosophies ever revealed or","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1062",6903,"one place, and it is quite possible that this Mrs. Legrand may not be in","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1074",6903,"Mrs. Slater went away the next morning. On the following day but one Miss","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1075",6903,"Ludington received a letter from her. She told her friend how glad she","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1076",6903,"was that she had not postponed her visit to her, for if she had set it","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1077",6903,"for a single day later she could not have made it at all. When she","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1078",6903,"returned home she found that her husband had received an offer of a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1079",6903,"lucrative business position in Cincinnati, contingent on his immediate","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1080",6903,"removal there.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1081",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1082",6903,"They had been in a whirl of packing ever since, and were to take that","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1083",6903,"night's train for Cincinnati, and whether they ever again came East to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1084",6903,"live was very doubtful. In a postscript, written crosswise, she said:","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1085",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1086",6903,"""I have been in such a rush ever since I came home that I declare I had","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1087",6903,"clean forgotten till this moment about my promise to hunt up Mrs.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1088",6903,"Legrand's address for you. Very likely you have also forgotten by this","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1089",6903,"time our talk about her, and if so it will not matter. But it vexes me to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1090",6903,"fail in a promise, and, if possible, I will snatch a moment before we","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1091",6903,"leave to send a note to the friend I spoke of, and ask her to look the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1092",6903,"woman up for you.""","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1093",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1094",6903,"Instead of being disappointed, Miss Ludington was, on the whole, relieved","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1095",6903,"to get this letter, and inclined to hope that Mrs. Slater had failed to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1096",6903,"find the time to write her friend. In that case this extraordinary","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1097",6903,"project of visiting a spiritualist medium would quietly fall through,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1098",6903,"which was the best thing that could happen.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1099",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1100",6903,"The fact is, after sleeping on it, she had seen clearly that such a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1101",6903,"proceeding for a person of her position and antecedents would not only be","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1102",6903,"preposterous, but almost disreputable. She was astonished at herself to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1103",6903,"think that her feelings could have been so wrought upon as to cause her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1104",6903,"seriously to contemplate such a step. All her life she had held the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1105",6903,"conviction, which she supposed to be shared by all persons of culture and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1106",6903,"respectability, that spiritualism was a low and immoral superstition,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1107",6903,"invariably implying fraud in its professors, and folly in its dupes:","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1108",6903,"something, in fact, quite below the notice of persons of intelligence or","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1109",6903,"good taste. As for the idea that this medium could show her the spirit of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1110",6903,"her former self, or any other real spirit, it was simply imbecile to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1111",6903,"entertain it for a moment.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1112",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1113",6903,"If, however, Miss Ludington was relieved by Mrs. Slater's letter, Paul","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1114",6903,"was keenly disappointed. His prejudice against spiritualism was by no","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1115",6903,"means so deeply rooted as hers. In a general way he had always believed","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1116",6903,"mediums to be frauds, and their shows mere shams, but he had been ready","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1117",6903,"to allow with Mrs. Slater, that, mixed up in all this fraud, there might","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1118",6903,"be a very little truth.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1119",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1120",6903,"His mind admitted a bare possibility that this Mrs. Legrand might be able","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1121",6903,"to show him the living face and form of his spirit-love. That possibility","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1122",6903,"once admitted had completely dominated his imagination, and it made","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1123",6903,"little difference whether it was one chance in a thousand or one in a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1124",6903,"million. He was like the victim of the lottery mania, whose absorption in","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1125",6903,"contemplating the possibility of drawing the prize renders him quite","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1126",6903,"oblivious of the nine hundred and ninety-nine blank tickets.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1127",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1128",6903,"Previous to Mrs. Slater's visit he had been quite content in his devotion","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1129",6903,"to an ideal mistress, for the reason that any nearer approach to her had","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1130",6903,"not occurred to him as a possibility. But now the suggestion that he","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1131",6903,"might see her face to face had so inflamed his imagination that it was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1132",6903,"out of the question for him to regain his former serenity. He resolved","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1133",6903,"that, in case they should fail to hear from Mrs. Slater's friend, he","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1134",6903,"would set about finding Mrs. Legrand himself, or, failing that, would go","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1135",6903,"to some other medium. There would be no solace for the fever that had now","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1136",6903,"got into his blood, until experiment should justify his daring hope, or","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1137",6903,"prove it baseless.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1138",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1139",6903,"However, the third day after Mrs. Slater's letter there came one from her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1140",6903,"friend, Mrs. Rhinehart. She said that she had received a note from Mrs.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1141",6903,"Slater, who had suddenly been called to Cincinnati, telling that Miss","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1142",6903,"Ludington desired the address of Mrs. Legrand, with a view to securing a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1143",6903,"private seance. She could have sent the address at once, as she had it;","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1144",6903,"but Mrs. Legrand was so overrun with business that an application to her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1145",6903,"by letter, especially from a stranger like Miss Ludington, might not have","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1146",6903,"any result. And so Mrs. Rhinehart, who had been only too happy to oblige","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1147",6903,"any friend of Mrs. Slater's, had called personally upon Mrs. Legrand to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1148",6903,"arrange for the seance. The medium had told her at first that she was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1149",6903,"full of previous engagements for a month ahead, and that it would be","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1150",6903,"impossible to give Miss Ludington a seance. When, however, Mrs. Rhinehart","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1151",6903,"told her that Miss Ludington's purpose in asking for the seance was to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1152",6903,"test the question whether our past selves have immortal souls distinct","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1153",6903,"from our present selves, Mrs. Legrand became greatly interested, and at","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1154",6903,"once said that she would cancel a previous appointment, and give Miss","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1155",6903,"Ludington a seance the following evening, at her parlours, No. -- East","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1156",6903,"Tenth Street, at nine o'clock. Mrs. Legrand had said that while she had","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1157",6903,"never heard a belief in the immortality of past selves avowed, there had","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1158",6903,"not been lacking in her relations with the spirit-world some mysterious","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1159",6903,"experiences that seemed to confirm it. She should, therefore, look","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1161",6903,"as much confidence, and quite as much interest, as Miss Ludington","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1162",6903,"herself. Mrs. Rhinehart hoped that the following evening would be","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1163",6903,"convenient for Miss Ludington. She had assumed the responsibility of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1164",6903,"making the engagement positive, as she might have failed in securing a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1165",6903,"seance altogether had she waited to communicate with Miss Ludington.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1166",6903,"Hoping that ""the conditions would be favourable,"" she remained, &c. &c.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1168",6903,"When Miss Ludington had read this letter to Paul, she intimated, though","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1169",6903,"rather faintly, that it was still not too late to withdraw from the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1170",6903,"enterprise; they could send Mrs. Legrand her fee, say that it was not","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1171",6903,"convenient for them to come on the evening fixed, and so let the matter","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1172",6903,"drop. Paul stared at her in astonishment, and said that, if she did not","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1173",6903,"feel like going, he would go alone, as he had at first proposed. Upon","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1174",6903,"this Miss Ludington once more declared that they would go together, and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1175",6903,"said nothing further about sacrificing the appointment.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1176",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1177",6903,"The fact is she did not really wish to sacrifice it. She was experiencing","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1178",6903,"a revulsion of feeling; Mrs. Rhinehart's letter had affected her almost","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1179",6903,"as strongly as Mrs. Slater's talk. The fact that Mrs. Legrand had at once","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1180",6903,"seen the reasonableness and probability of the belief in the immortality","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1181",6903,"of past selves made it difficult for Miss Ludington to think of her as a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1182",6903,"mere vulgar impostor. The vague hint of the medium's as to strange","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1183",6903,"experiences with the spirit world, confirmatory of this belief, appealed","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1184",6903,"to her imagination in a powerful manner. Of what description might the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1185",6903,"mysterious monitions be, which, coming to this woman in the dim","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1186",6903,"between-world where she groped, had prepared her to accept as true, on","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1187",6903,"its first statement, a belief that to others seemed so hard to credit?","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1188",6903,"What clutchings of spirit fingers in the dark! What moanings of souls","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1190",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1191",6903,"The confidence which Mrs. Legrand had expressed that the seance would","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1192",6903,"prove a success affected Miss Ludington very powerfully. It impressed her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1193",6903,"as the judgment of an expert; it compelled her to recognize not only as","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1194",6903,"possible, but even as probable, that, on the evening of the following","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1195",6903,"day, she should behold the beautiful girl whom once, so many years","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1199",6903,"With a trembling ecstasy, which in vain she tried to reason down, she","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1200",6903,"began to prepare herself for the presence of one fresh from the face of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1204",6903,"he gave himself wholly up to a delirious expectation. How would his","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1205",6903,"immortal mistress look? How would she move? What would be her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1206",6903,"stature--what her bearing? How would she gaze upon him? If not with love","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1211",6903,"in their absorption in the thoughts suggested by the approaching event.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1212",6903,"They sat abstracted and silent at table, and, on rising, went each their","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1217",6903,"question. About two o'clock in the morning she heard Paul leave his room","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1218",6903,"and go downstairs. Putting on dressing-gown and slippers she softly","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1219",6903,"followed him. There was a light in the sitting-room and the door was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1248",6903,"As the drive over to East Tenth Street was a long one, the carriage had","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1249",6903,"been ordered at seven o'clock, and soon after tea, of which neither Miss","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1250",6903,"Ludington nor Paul had been able to take a mouthful, they set out.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1254",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1255",6903,"During the drive of nearly two hours not another word was said.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1256",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1257",6903,"The carriage at length drew up before the house in Tenth Street. It stood","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1258",6903,"in a brick block, and there was no sign of the business pursued within,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1259",6903,"except a small white card on the door bearing the words, ""Mrs. Legrand.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1262",6903,"An old-looking little girl of ten or twelve years of age opened the door.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1263",6903,"The child's big black eyes, and long snaky locks falling about a pale","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1264",6903,"face, gave her an elfish look quite in keeping with the character of the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1265",6903,"house. She at once ushered the callers into the front parlour, where a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1266",6903,"lady and gentleman were sitting, who proved to be Mrs. Legrand and her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1267",6903,"manager and man of business, Dr. Hull.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1268",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1269",6903,"The latter was a tall person, of highly respectable and even imposing","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1270",6903,"appearance, to which a high forehead, a pair of gold-bowed spectacles,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1271",6903,"and a long white beard considerably added. He looked like a scholar, and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1272",6903,"his speech was that of a man of education.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1274",6903,"Mrs. Legrand was a large woman, with black hair sprinkled with grey and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1275",6903,"worn short like a man's. She had a swarthy complexion, and her eyes were","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1276",6903,"surrounded by noticeably large dark rings, giving an appearance of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1277",6903,"wretched ill-health. Her manner was extremely languid, as of a person","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1278",6903,"suffering from nervous exhaustion. She kept her eyes half shut, and spoke","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1309",6903,"The room in which they sat was a long apartment, divided by double","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1310",6903,"sliding-doors into a front and back parlour, the former of which had been","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1311",6903,"the scene of the preceding conversation.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1312",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1313",6903,"Dr. Hull now conducted the two visitors into the back parlour, which","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1314",6903,"proved to be of similar size and appearance to the front parlour, except","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1315",6903,"that it contained no furniture whatever. There was only one window in the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1316",6903,"back parlour, and this was firmly closed by inside blinds.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1317",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1318",6903,"It was also uncurtained, and in plain view from the front parlour.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1319",6903,"Besides the connection with the front parlour, there was but one door in","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1320",6903,"the back parlour. This opened into a small apartment, about six feet by","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1321",6903,"five, which had been taken out of the right-hand rear corner of the back","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1322",6903,"parlour, and was separated from it by a partition reaching to the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1323",6903,"ceiling. This was the cabinet. It had neither window nor door, except the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1324",6903,"one into the back parlour. A sofa was its only article of furniture, and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1325",6903,"this was of wicker-work, so that nothing could be concealed beneath it.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1327",6903,"""Mrs. Legrand lies upon this sofa while in a state of trance, during","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1329",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1330",6903,"A rug lay on the floor of the cabinet, the walls were of hard-finished","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1331",6903,"white plaster, quite bare, and the ceiling, like that of the parlours,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1332",6903,"was plain white, without ornament.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1333",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1336",6903,"Dr. Hull insisted upon making assurance doubly sure by pounding upon the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1337",6903,"walls and pulling up the rug in the cabinet, to prove that no sliding","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1338",6903,"panel or trap-door trick was possible. There was something calculated to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1339",6903,"make an unbeliever very uneasy in the quiet confidence of these people,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1341",6903,"impossible to account for any phenomenon that might appear, on any other","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1343",6903,"Miss Ludington or Paul that the wonderful mystery which they had hardly","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1344",6903,"dared to dream of was about to be enacted before them. They followed Dr.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1345",6903,"Hull on his tour of inspection as if they were in a dream, mechanically","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1346",6903,"observing what he pointed out, but replying at random to his remarks,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1347",6903,"and, indeed, barely aware of what they were doing. The sense of the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1348",6903,"unspeakably awful and tender scene so soon to pass before their eyes","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1351",6903,"Nor indeed would this detective work have had any interest for them in","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1354",6903,"to the reality of the face and form that for so many years had been","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1355",6903,"enshrined in their memories.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1361",6903,"impossibility of any person's being concealed there, Dr. Hull proceeded","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1362",6903,"to close and lock the hall-door, that being the only exit connecting this","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1363",6903,"suite of rooms with the rest of the house. Having placed a heavy chair","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1364",6903,"against the locked door for further security, he gave the key to Paul.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1369",6903,"As she did so a wild desire to fly from the room and the house came over","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1370",6903,"Miss Ludington. Not that she did not long inexpressibly to see the vision","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1371",6903,"that was drawing near, whose beautiful feet might even now be on the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1372",6903,"threshold, but the sense of its awfulness overcame her. She felt that she","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1373",6903,"was not fit, not ready, for it now. If she could only have more time to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1374",6903,"prepare herself, and then could come again. But it was too late to draw","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1376",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1377",6903,"Dr. Hull had arranged three chairs across the broad doorway between the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1379",6903,"to occupy the middle chair, and, trembling in every limb, she did so.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1387",6903,"parlours very low. The jets in both rooms were controlled by a stop-cock","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1388",6903,"in the wall by the side of the doorway between them. There were two jets","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1391",6903,"coming out of the cabinet. The light they diffused, after being turned","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1392",6903,"down; was enough to render forms and faces sufficiently visible for the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1393",6903,"recognition of acquaintances, though a close study of features would have","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1395",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1396",6903,"It now appeared that the glass shades of the jets in the back parlour","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1401",6903,"perfect silence of some moments ensued, during which she could perfectly","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1402",6903,"hear the beating of Paul's heart. Then Alta began, with a wonderfully","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1403",6903,"soft touch, to play a succession of low, dreamy chords, rather than any","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1404",6903,"set composition--music that thrilled the listeners with vague suggestions","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1405",6903,"of the unfathomable mystery and unutterable sadness of human life. She","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1406",6903,"played on and on. It seemed to two of the hearers that she played for","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1407",6903,"hours, although it was probably but a few minutes.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1408",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1411",6903,"They had a sensation of being breathed upon by a faint, cool draught of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1412",6903,"air, and then appeared in the door-way of the cabinet the figure of a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1413",6903,"beautiful girl, which, after standing still a moment, glided forth, by an","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1428",6903,"of her young form, the enchanting sweetness of her expression. The golden","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1429",6903,"hair fell in luxuriant tresses about the face and down the dazzling","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1430",6903,"shoulders. The lips were parted in a pleased smile as, with a gliding","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1431",6903,"motion, she approached the rapt watchers.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1432",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1433",6903,"Her eyes rested on Miss Ludington with a look full of recognition and a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1435",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1436",6903,"Then she looked at Paul. Her smile was no longer the smile of an angel,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1437",6903,"but of a woman. The light of her violet eyes burned like delicious flame","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1438",6903,"to the marrow of his bones.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1439",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1440",6903,"She was so near him that he could have touched her. Her beauty overcame","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1441",6903,"his senses. Forgetting all else, in an agony of love, he was about to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1442",6903,"clasp her in his arms, but she drew back with a gentle gesture of denial.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1446",6903,"obeying an unseen attraction, she retreated, still facing them, across","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1450",6903,"before. But this time she played but a few moments, and when she ceased,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1451",6903,"Mrs. Legrand's voice was heard faintly calling her. She glided between","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1465",6903,"tones of Dr. Hull, was quite too much for the poor lady, and with a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1466",6903,"piteous gesture, she buried her face in her hands. Alta now came out of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1467",6903,"the cabinet, and said that her mother would like them to examine it once","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1476",6903,"to them that he suspected fraud; but the fact was very different. His","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1477",6903,"conduct was merely the result of a confused hope that he might gain","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1483",6903,"away disappointed, the medium rose, and leaning on her daughter, returned","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1484",6903,"to the front parlour. She looked completely overcome. Her face was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1485",6903,"deathly pale, and the dark rings around her eyes were larger and darker","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1486",6903,"than ever. She leaned back in her chair, which had a special rest for her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1494",6903,"all, she had dared dream of. Dr. Hull, in a very enthusiastic manner,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1495",6903,"went on to describe the manifestation more particularly. He declared that","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1567",6903,"""As Miss Ludington suggests,"" observed Dr. Hull, ""in spiritualism one","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1568",6903,"soon ceases to consider whether a thing be wonderful or not, but only if","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1569",6903,"it be true. And so as to this matter. Now, if the death of a medium","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1570",6903,"should be absolutely instantaneous, the spirit might, indeed, be unable","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1571",6903,"to dematerialize, and might even succeed to the medium's earth life, as","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1572",6903,"you suggest. The trouble with the theory--and it seems to me a fatal","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1573",6903,"one--is, that death is almost never, if indeed it is ever, absolutely","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1574",6903,"instantaneous but only comparatively so; and it seems to me that the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1575",6903,"least possible interval of time would be sufficient to enable the spirit","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1576",6903,"to dematerialize. Consequently, it strikes me, that while the result you","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1577",6903,"suppose is theoretically possible, it could, practically, never occur.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1611",6903,"distinct from her present self, and Paul, to whom she was indebted for","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1614",6903,"But there is a great difference between the strongest form of faith and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1616",6903,"witnessed in Mrs. Legrand's parlours was almost as startling as if they","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1677",6903,"temptation of drawing near to the place where she had been only a few","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1678",6903,"hours before. He walked to and fro before Mrs. Legrand's house for an","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1796",6903,"hoped that from time to time she should see Ida again; still, her life","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1800",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1801",6903,"Very different was it with Paul. He was young; heaven was very far off,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1802",6903,"and the way thither, unless cheered by occasional visitations of his","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1803",6903,"radiant mistress, seemed inexpressibly long and dreary. The nature of his","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1804",6903,"sentiment for Ida had changed since he had seen her clothed in a living","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1805",6903,"form, from the worship of a sweet but dim ideal to the passion which a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1806",6903,"living woman inspires. He thought of her no more as a spirit, lofty and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1811",6903,"before seemed so sweet, palled upon him. The eyes, that had always been","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1812",6903,"so tender, now lacked expression. The lips that the boy had climbed up to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1813",6903,"kiss, how had the artist failed to intimate their exquisite curves! The","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1814",6903,"whole picture had suffered a subtle deterioration, and looked hard,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1815",6903,"wooden, lifeless, and almost, unlike. The living woman had eclipsed the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1839",6903,"passionate intensity of Paul's, she had, notwithstanding, longed for it","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1844",6903,"As for Paul he had dressed himself with extreme care for the occasion,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1845",6903,"and looked to his best advantage. He had said to himself, ""Shall I not","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1846",6903,"show her as much observance as I would pay to a living woman?"" And who","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1847",6903,"can say--for very odd, sometimes, are the inarticulate processes of the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1848",6903,"mind--that there was not at the bottom of his thoughts something of the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1849",6903,"universal lover's willingness to let his mistress see him at his best?","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1850",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1851",6903,"They found the front parlour occupied as before by Mrs. Legrand and Dr.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1852",6903,"Hull, when Alta showed them in. The medium was, as previously, the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1853",6903,"picture of ill-health, and if she did not look noticeably worse than","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1854",6903,"before her sickness, it was merely because she had looked as badly as","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1855",6903,"possible then. In response to inquiries about her health she admitted","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1856",6903,"that she did not really feel equal to resuming her seances quite so soon,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1857",6903,"and but for disliking to disappoint them would have postponed this","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1864",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1865",6903,"Paul's reply to this humane suggestion was not so prompt as it should","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1866",6903,"have been. In his heart he felt at that moment that he was as bad as a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1867",6903,"murderer. He knew that he was willing this woman should risk not only her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1868",6903,"health, but even her life, rather than that he should fail to see Ida. He","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1869",6903,"was striving to repress this feeling, so far at least as to say that he","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1870",6903,"would not insist upon going on with the seance, when Mrs. Legrand, with a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1874",6903,"obliged for your interest in me; but I am rather notional about keeping","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1875",6903,"my promises, and it is a peculiarity in which my friends have to indulge","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1890",6903,"upon the same tour of inspection that they had made the former evening.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1891",6903,"They found everything precisely as it had been on that occasion. There","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1892",6903,"was no possibility of concealing any person in the cabinet or the back","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1893",6903,"parlour, and no apparent or conceivable means by which any person could","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1894",6903,"reach those apartments, except through the front parlour.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1895",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1896",6903,"On their return to the latter apartment the proceedings followed the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1897",6903,"order observed at the previous seance. Mrs. Legrand rose from her chair","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1898",6903,"and walked feebly through the back parlour into the cabinet. Dr. Hull","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1899",6903,"then locked and braced a chair against the door opening into the hall,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1900",6903,"giving the key to Paul. Then, having arranged the three chairs as before,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1901",6903,"across the double door between the parlours, he seated Miss Ludington and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1902",6903,"Paul, and, having turned the gas down, took the third chair.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1903",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1904",6903,"All being ready, Alta, who was at the piano, struck the opening chords of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1905",6903,"the same soft, low music that she had played at the previous seance.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1906",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1907",6903,"It seemed to Miss Ludington that she played much longer than before, and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1908",6903,"she began to think that either there was to be some failure in the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1909",6903,"seance, or that something had happened to Mrs. Legrand.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1910",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1911",6903,"Perhaps she was dead. This horrible thought, added to the strain of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1912",6903,"expectancy, affected her nerves so that in another moment she must have","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1913",6903,"screamed out, when, as before, she felt a faint, cool air fan her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1914",6903,"forehead, and a few seconds later Ida appeared at the door of the cabinet","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1915",6903,"and glided into the room.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1920",6903,"From the moment that she emerged from the shadows of the cabinet Paul's","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1921",6903,"eyes were glued to her face with an intensity quite beyond any ordinary","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"2800",6903,"of Miss Ludington and Paul which it would be inadequate to describe as","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"2808",6903,"whom she feels to be a part, and the choicest part, of her own life. The","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"2809",6903,"instinct of maternity, never gratified in her by the possession of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"2853",6903,"smiles of affection not of gaiety, and there was always a shadow in her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"2887",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"2888",6903,"""Why, my darling, they are yours,"" replied Miss Ludington. ""I am not","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"2889",6903,"making you a gift. It was to you that mother gave them. I only return you","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"2899",6903,"would doubtless have been struck with the fact that a young girl was the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"2900",6903,"central figure of the household, around whom its other members revolved;","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"2902",6903,"households, would have seemed to such an observer sufficiently explained","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"2903",6903,"by the unusual gentleness and beauty of the girl herself. The necessity","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"2904",6903,"of a supernatural explanation certainly would not have occurred to him.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"2908",6903,"might be, their speculations did not extend beyond the commonly","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3105",6903,"composed of not one, but many persons, a new department will be added to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3106",6903,"ethics, relating to the duties of the successive selves of an individual","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3108",6903,"duty of a man to fulfil all reasonable obligations incurred by his past","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3109",6903,"selves, on the same principle that a pious son fulfils the equitable","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3110",6903,"obligations incurred by a parent. This duty is, indeed, recognized","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3111",6903,"to-day, although not on the correct basis. As regards the ethical","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3112",6903,"relation of a man to the selves who succeed him, a wholly new idea will","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3113",6903,"be introduced. It will be seen that the duty of a man to lead a wise","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3114",6903,"life, to be prudent, to make the most of his powers, to maintain a good","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3115",6903,"name, is not a duty to himself, merely an enlightened selfishness, as it","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3116",6903,"is now called, but a genuine form of altruism, a duty to others, as truly","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3117",6903,"as if those others bore different names instead of succeeding to his","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3118",6903,"name. It will be seen that a man's duty to his later selves is like the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3119",6903,"duty of a father to his helpless children: to provide for their","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3123",6903,"the enemy of his neighbours, because he is blasting coming lives that","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3483",6903,"This transformation of the devotee into the lover on his part was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3485",6903,"relieved from a strained pose could not show more evident relief than she","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3486",6903,"did in stepping down from the pedestal of a tutelary saint, where he had","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3487",6903,"placed her, to be loved and caressed like an ordinary woman, for if the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3502",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3503",6903,"Whether it was because she was in love or not it is certain that she took","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3504",6903,"to crying very often during these days. Her manner with her lover, too,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3505",6903,"was often strangely moody. Sometimes she would display a gaiety that was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3506",6903,"almost feverish, and shortly after, perhaps, he would surprise her in","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3507",6903,"tears. But she always declared that she was not unhappy; and, unable to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3508",6903,"conceive of any reason why she should be, Paul was fain to conceive that","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3510",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3511",6903,"The absorption of the lovers in each other's society naturally left Miss","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3512",6903,"Ludington more often alone than before; but Ida was very far from","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3513",6903,"neglecting her for her lover. Her care for her since her sickness was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3514",6903,"such as a daughter might give to a beloved and invalid mother. It was an","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3515",6903,"attention such as the lonely old lady had never enjoyed in her life, or","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3516",6903,"looked for, and would have been most grateful to have had from any one,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3518",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3519",6903,"The village street was a rarely romantic promenade on moonlight evenings,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3520",6903,"and the twanging of Paul's guitar was often heard till after midnight","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3521",6903,"from the meeting-house steps, which were a favourite resort with the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3522",6903,"lovers. Those steps, in the Hilton of Miss Ludington's girlhood, had been","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3523",6903,"a very popular locality with sentimental couples, and she well remembered","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3524",6903,"certain short-lived romances of Ida's first life on earth with which they","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3525",6903,"had been associated. One night, when the young people had lingered there","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3526",6903,"later than usual, Miss Ludington put on her shawl and stepped across the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3527",6903,"green to warn them that it was time for even lovers to be abed.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3528",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3529",6903,"As she approached, Paul was seated on the lower step, touching his","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3530",6903,"guitar, and facing Ida, who sat on the step above leaning back against a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3531",6903,"pillar. A blotch of moonlight fell upon her dreamy, upturned face. One","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3532",6903,"hand lay in her lap, and the fingers of the other were idly playing with","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3533",6903,"a tress of hair that had fallen over her bosom. How well Miss Ludington","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3534",6903,"remembered that attitude, and even the habit of playing with her hair","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3535",6903,"which Ida had in the days so long gone by.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3536",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3537",6903,"She stood in the shadow watching her till Paul ceased playing. Then she","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3538",6903,"advanced and spoke to them.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3539",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3540",6903,"""I have been standing here looking at you, my sister,"" she said. ""I have","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3541",6903,"been trying to imagine how strangely it must come over you that forty","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3542",6903,"years ago you sat here as you sit here now, just as young and beautiful","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3548",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3549",6903,"""And I don't like to think of them,"" echoed Paul, with a curious","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3550",6903,"sensation of jealousy, not the first of the kind that he had experienced","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3551",6903,"in imagining the former life of his darling. ""I do not like to think who","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3552",6903,"may have sat at her feet then. I, too, would like to forget these days.""","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3553",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3554",6903,"Ida bent her head still lower and said nothing. It was Miss Ludington who","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3555",6903,"spoke.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3556",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3557",6903,"""You have no ground to feel so,"" she said. ""I can bear her witness--and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3558",6903,"what better witness could you have?--that till now she never knew what it","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3559",6903,"is to love. It is true she sat here then as now, and there were others at","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3560",6903,"her feet, drawn by the same beauty that has drawn you, but their voices","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3561",6903,"never touched her heart. She had to come back again to earth to learn","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3562",6903,"what love is.""","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3563",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3564",6903,"Paul bent contritely, and kissed Ida's feet as she sat above him,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3565",6903,"murmuring, ""Forgive me!"" Her hand sought his and pressed it with","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3566",6903,"convulsive strength.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3567",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3568",6903,"They walked home in silence, gentle Miss Ludington inwardly reproaching","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3569",6903,"herself for the embarrassment her words had seemed to cause Ida. She","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3570",6903,"examined her memory afresh. It was very long ago; she was growing old,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3571",6903,"and it was natural to suppose that her memory might be losing in","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3572",6903,"distinctness. Perhaps some, of the sweethearts of that far away time had","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3573",6903,"been a little nearer, a little dearer, to Ida than to her own fading","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3574",6903,"memory they seemed to have been. Perhaps she had done a stupid thing in","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3575",6903,"referring to those days.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3576",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3577",6903,"Meanwhile, despite of circumstances that would seem peculiarly favourable","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3578",6903,"to a young girl's happiness, Ida's tendency to melancholy was increasing","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3579",6903,"upon her at a rate which began to cause Miss Ludington as well as Paul","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3580",6903,"serious anxiety. She had indeed been pensive from the first, but the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3581",6903,"expression of her face, when in repose, had of late become one of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3582",6903,"profound dejection. The shadow which they had never been able to banish","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3583",6903,"from her eyes had deepened into a look of habitual sadness. Coming upon","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3584",6903,"her unexpectedly, both Miss Ludington and Paul had several times found","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3585",6903,"her in tears, which she would not or could not explain. Not infrequently,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3586",6903,"when she was alone with her lover, and they had been silent awhile, he","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3587",6903,"had looked up to find her eyes fixed upon him and brimming with tears,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3588",6903,"and at other times, when he was in the very act of caressing her, she","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3589",6903,"would burst out crying, and sob in his arms.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3590",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3591",6903,"But her unaccountable reluctance to consent to any definite arrangement","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3592",6903,"for her marriage with the man she tenderly loved, and had promised to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3593",6903,"wed, was the most marked symptom of something hysterical in her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3594",6903,"condition.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3595",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3596",6903,"Some three weeks had elapsed since she had given her word to be Paul's","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3597",6903,"wife, but though he had repeatedly begged her to name a day for their","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3598",6903,"wedding, he had entirely failed to obtain any satisfactory reply. When he","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3599",6903,"grew importunate, the only effect was to set her to crying, as if her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3600",6903,"heart would break. He was completely perplexed. If she did not love him","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3601",6903,"her conduct would be readily explainable; but that she was in love with","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3602",6903,"him, and very much in love with him, he had increasing evidence every","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3603",6903,"day.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3604",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3605",6903,"She gave nothing that could be called a reason for refusing to say when","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3607",6903,"of not being ready; but when he reminded her of the special","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3608",6903,"considerations that made delay inexpedient, of her own peculiarly","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3609",6903,"unprotected condition, and of Miss Ludington's uncertain health, and","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3610",6903,"desire to see them married as soon as possible, she attempted no reply,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3611",6903,"but took refuge in tears, leaving him no choice but to relinquish the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3620",6903,"experiences through which she had passed in the last month or two,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3728",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3729",6903,"Meanwhile Paul had seen Miss Ludington, and she had told him of her talk","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3730",6903,"with Ida, and its result. The young man was beside himself with chagrin,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3731",6903,"humiliation, and baffled love. The fact that Ida had consented to the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3732",6903,"plan of adoption showed beyond doubt that she had given up all idea of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3733",6903,"being his wife, at least for the present, and possibly of ever marrying","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3735",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3736",6903,"Why had she dealt with him so strangely? Why had she used him with such","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3737",6903,"cruel caprice? Was ever a man treated so perversely by a woman who loved","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3738",6903,"him? Miss Ludington could only shake her head as he poured out his","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3739",6903,"complaints to her. Ida's contradictory behaviour was as much a puzzle to","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3740",6903,"her as to him, and she deplored it scarcely less. But she insisted that","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3741",6903,"he should not trouble the girl by demanding explanations of her, as that,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3745",6903,"person, it vanished when he met Ida at the tea-table. The sight of her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3746",6903,"swollen eyes and red lids, and the piteous looks, of deprecating","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3747",6903,"tenderness which from time to time she bent on him, left room for nothing","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3749",6903,"secret of this strange caprice it was evidently no mere piece of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3750",6903,"wantonness. She was suffering from it as much as he.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3758",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3759",6903,"It was about ten o'clock when he returned home. As he came in sight of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3760",6903,"the house he saw by the light reflected from the sitting-room windows","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3761",6903,"that there was some one upon the piazza. As he came nearer he perceived","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3762",6903,"that it was Ida. She was sitting sidewise upon a long, cane-bottomed","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3763",6903,"settee, and her arms were thrown upon the back of it to form a sort of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3764",6903,"pillow on which her head rested. His tread upon the turf was inaudible,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3765",6903,"and she neither saw nor heard him as he approached, nor when, softly","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3766",6903,"mounting the steps, he stood over her.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3767",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3768",6903,"She was indeed sobbing with such violence that she could not have been","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3769",6903,"easily sensible of anything external. Paul had never heard such piteous","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3770",6903,"weeping. He had never seen much of women's crying, and he did not know","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3771",6903,"what abandonment of grief their tender frames can sustain--grief that","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3772",6903,"seemingly would kill a man if he could feel it. Long, gurgling sobs","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3773",6903,"followed one another as the waves of the sea sweep over the head of a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3774",6903,"straggling swimmer. Every now and then they were interrupted by sharp","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3775",6903,"cries of exquisite anguish, such as might be wrung out by the sudden","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3776",6903,"twist of a rack, and then would come a low, shrill crooning sound, almost","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3777",6903,"musical, beyond which it seemed grief could not go.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3778",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3779",6903,"The violence of the paroxysm would pass, and she would grow calmer,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3780",6903,"drawing long, shuddering breaths as she struggled back to self-control.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3781",6903,"Then a quick panting would begin and grow faster and faster, till another","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3783",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3784",6903,"In very awe of such great grief Paul stood awhile silently over her, the","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3785",6903,"tears filling his own eyes and running down his cheeks unheeded. She had","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3786",6903,"wept something like this, though nothing like so long or so bitterly, on","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3787",6903,"former occasions, when he had urged her with special vehemence to fix a","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3788",6903,"day when she would fulfil her promise to be his wife.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3789",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3790",6903,"Now, as he pondered the piteous spectacle before him, the thought came","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3791",6903,"over him that his first reverential instinct concerning her, that despite","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3792",6903,"her resumption of a mortal form she was something more than mortal, was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3793",6903,"true, and that he had done wrong in so far forgetting it as to urge her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3794",6903,"to be his wife as if she were merely a woman like others. She herself did","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3795",6903,"not know it, but surely this exceeding cruel crying was nothing else but","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3796",6903,"the conflict between the love of the woman which went out to her earthly","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3797",6903,"lover, and would fain make him happy, and the nature of the inhabitant of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3798",6903,"heaven, where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage. This was","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3799",6903,"the key to her inexplicable sorrow during the past weeks. This explained","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3800",6903,"why, though she loved him so tenderly, the thought of becoming his wife","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3801",6903,"was so intolerable to her.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3802",6903,"","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3803",6903,"So be it. Her nature could not sink to his, but his should rise to hers.","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3804",6903,"This brief dream of earthly passion must pass. Better a thousand times","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3805",6903,"that he should be disappointed in all that is dear to the heart of a man,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3806",6903,"than that he should grieve her thus. In that moment it did not seem hard","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3807",6903,"to him to sacrifice the hopes of the man to the devotion of the lover. By","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3808",6903,"one great effort he rose again to the level of the ascetic passion that","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3809",6903,"had glorified his life up to these last delirious weeks. She had brought","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3810",6903,"heaven to earth for him, but it should still be heaven, since her","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3815",6903,"started, and turned her streaming eyes to him, then, seeing who it was,","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"3913",6903,"been very, very hard for us to get a living. Father is a man of","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"3914",6903,"education, and had tried many things before we came to this, but nothing","Miss Ludington's Sister","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
