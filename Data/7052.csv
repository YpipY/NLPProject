"779",7052,"in his presence. The sensation of mastery, of power over her, which it","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"792",7052,"sprang up and extended her his hand. Assuming an expression as if she","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"823",7052,"seemed to fully realize the importance of the proceeding to suffer unduly","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1229",7052,"him as yet nothing of her apprehensions. She was aware that the affection","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1230",7052,"between her brother and Madeline was chiefly on his side, and knew enough","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1231",7052,"of her wilfulness to be sure that any attempted interference by him would","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1240",7052,"had made in his courtship at the picnic. He had told his love--he had","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1242",7052,"rejected, and that was a measure of success quite enough to intoxicate so","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1244",7052,"taken courage at remembering the sweet pity that shone in her eyes at the","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"1245",7052,"revelation of his love-lorn state? The fruition of his hopes, to which he","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"1247",7052,"future, was, maybe, almost at hand. Circumstances combined to prolong","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
