"23",7303,"Looking Backward was a small book, and I was not able to get into it all","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"24",7303,"I wished to say on the subject. Since it was published what was left out","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"25",7303,"of it has loomed up as so much more important than what it contained that","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"26",7303,"I have been constrained to write another book. I have taken the date of","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"27",7303,"Looking Backward, the year 2000, as that of Equality, and have utilized","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"28",7303,"the framework of the former story as a starting point for this which I","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"29",7303,"now offer. In order that those who have not read Looking Backward may be","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"30",7303,"at no disadvantage, an outline of the essential features of that story is","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"33",7303,"In the year 1887 Julian West was a rich young man living in Boston. He","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"34",7303,"was soon to be married to a young lady of wealthy family named Edith","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"35",7303,"Bartlett, and meanwhile lived alone with his man-servant Sawyer in the","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"36",7303,"family mansion. Being a sufferer from insomnia, he had caused a chamber","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"37",7303,"to be built of stone beneath the foundation of the house, which he used","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"38",7303,"for a sleeping room. When even the silence and seclusion of this retreat","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"39",7303,"failed to bring slumber, he sometimes called in a professional mesmerizer","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"40",7303,"to put him into a hypnotic sleep, from which Sawyer knew how to arouse","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"41",7303,"him at a fixed time. This habit, as well as the existence of the","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"42",7303,"underground chamber, were secrets known only to Sawyer and the hypnotist","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"43",7303,"who rendered his services. On the night of May 30, 1887, West sent for","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"44",7303,"the latter, and was put to sleep as usual. The hypnotist had previously","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"45",7303,"informed his patron that he was intending to leave the city permanently","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"46",7303,"the same evening, and referred him to other practitioners. That night the","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"47",7303,"house of Julian West took fire and was wholly destroyed. Remains","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
"48",7303,"identified as those of Sawyer were found and, though no vestige of West","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"61",7303,"life, and after a short time to the full vigor of youth which his","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"

"69",7303,"Step by step, almost as to a child, his hosts explained to him, who had","Equality","Bellamy, Edward","Science Fiction","en"
