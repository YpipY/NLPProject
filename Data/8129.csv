"1285",8129,"represented in stone beasts that have long since passed away from","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1286",8129,"Earth--the dragon, the griffin, the hippogriffin, and the different","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1287",8129,"species of gargoyle. Nothing was to be found, whether material or custom,","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1292",8129,"him what men did in Astahahn and what their merchandise was, and with whom","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1298",8129,"say no more, but busied himself in behaving in accordance with ancient","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1299",8129,"custom. And so, according to the will of Yann, we drifted onwards and left","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1300",8129,"Astahahn. The river widened below Astahahn, and we found in greater","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1362",8129,"nothing remained to him but death. And while he was carefully lifting his","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1363",8129,"beard with his left hand, the merchant eyed the merchandise again, and","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1364",8129,"said that rather than see so worthy a captain die, a man for whom he had","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1365",8129,"conceived an especial love when first he saw the manner in which he","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1366",8129,"handled his ship, he and his aged father should starve together and","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1367",8129,"therefore he offered fifteen piffeks more.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1368",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1369",8129,"When he said this the captain prostrated himself and prayed to his gods","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1370",8129,"that they might yet sweeten this merchant's bitter heart--to his little","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1371",8129,"lesser gods, to the gods that bless Belzoond.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1372",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1373",8129,"At last the merchant offered yet five piffeks more. Then the captain wept,","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1374",8129,"for he said that he was deserted of his gods; and the merchant also wept,","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1375",8129,"for he said that he was thinking of his aged father, and of how he soon","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1376",8129,"would starve, and he hid his weeping face with both his hands, and eyed","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1377",8129,"the tollub again between his fingers. And so the bargain was concluded,","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1378",8129,"and the merchant took the toomarund and tollub, paying for them out of a","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1379",8129,"great clinking purse. And these were packed up into bales again, and three","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1380",8129,"of the merchant's slaves carried them upon their heads into the city. And","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1381",8129,"all the while the sailors had sat silent, cross-legged in a crescent upon","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1382",8129,"the deck, eagerly watching the bargain, and now a murmur of satisfaction","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1383",8129,"arose among them, and they began to compare it among themselves with other","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1384",8129,"bargains that they had known. And I found out from them that there are","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1385",8129,"seven merchants in Perdondaris, and that they had all come to the captain","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1386",8129,"one by one before the bargaining began, and each had warned him privately","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1387",8129,"against the others. And to all the merchants the captain had offered the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1388",8129,"wine of his own country, that they make in fair Belzoond, but could in no","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1389",8129,"wise persuade them to it. But now that the bargain was over, and the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1390",8129,"sailors were seated at the first meal of the day, the captain appeared","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1391",8129,"among them with a cask of that wine, and we broached it with care and all","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1392",8129,"made merry together. And the captain was glad in his heart because he knew","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1393",8129,"that he had much honour in the eyes of his men because of the bargain that","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1394",8129,"he had made. So the sailors drank the wine of their native land, and soon","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1395",8129,"their thoughts were back in fair Belzoond and the little neighbouring","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1396",8129,"cities of Durl and Duz.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1397",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1398",8129,"But for me the captain poured into a little jar some heavy yellow wine","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1399",8129,"from a small jar which he kept apart among his sacred things. Thick and","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1400",8129,"sweet it was, even like honey, yet there was in its heart a mighty, ardent","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1401",8129,"fire which had authority over souls of men. It was made, the captain told","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1402",8129,"me, with great subtlety by the secret craft of a family of six who lived","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1403",8129,"in a hut on the mountains of Hian Min. Once in these mountains, he said,","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1404",8129,"he followed the spoor of a bear, and he came suddenly on a man of that","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1405",8129,"family who had hunted the same bear, and he was at the end of a narrow way","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1406",8129,"with precipice all about him, and his spear was sticking in the bear, and","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1407",8129,"the wound was not fatal, and he had no other weapon. And the bear was","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1408",8129,"walking towards the man, very slowly because his wound irked him--yet he","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1409",8129,"was now very close. And what he captain did he would not say, but every","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1410",8129,"year as soon as the snows are hard, and travelling is easy on the Hian","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1411",8129,"Min, that man comes down to the market in the plains, and always leaves","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1412",8129,"for the captain in the gate of fair Belzoond a vessel of that priceless","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1413",8129,"secret wine.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1414",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1415",8129,"And as I sipped the wine and the captain talked, I remembered me of","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1416",8129,"stalwart noble things that I had long since resolutely planned, and my","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1417",8129,"soul seemed to grow mightier within me and to dominate the whole tide of","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1418",8129,"the Yann. It may be that I then slept. Or, if I did not, I do not now","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1419",8129,"minutely recollect every detail of that morning's occupations. Towards","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1420",8129,"evening, I awoke and wishing to see Perdondaris before we left in the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1421",8129,"morning, and being unable to wake the captain, I went ashore alone.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1422",8129,"Certainly Perdondaris was a powerful city; it was encompassed by a wall of","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1423",8129,"great strength and altitude, having in it hollow ways for troops to walk","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1424",8129,"in, and battlements along it all the way, and fifteen strong towers on it","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1425",8129,"in every mile, and copper plaques low down where men could read them,","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1426",8129,"telling in all the languages of those parts of the earth--one language on","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1427",8129,"each plaque--the tale of how an army once attacked Perdondaris and what","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1428",8129,"befell that army. Then I entered Perdondaris and found all the people","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1429",8129,"dancing, clad in brilliant silks, and playing on the tambang as they","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1430",8129,"danced. For a fearful thunderstorm had terrified them while I slept, and","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1431",8129,"the fires of death, they said, had danced over Perdondaris, and now the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1432",8129,"thunder had gone leaping away large and black and hideous, they said, over","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1433",8129,"the distant hills, and had turned round snarling at them, shoving his","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1434",8129,"gleaming teeth, and had stamped, as he went, upon the hilltops until they","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1435",8129,"rang as though they had been bronze. And often and again they stopped in","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1436",8129,"their merry dances and prayed to the God they knew not, saying, ""O, God","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1437",8129,"that we know not, we thank Thee for sending the thunder back to his","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1438",8129,"hills."" And I went on and came to the market-place, and lying there upon","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1439",8129,"the marble pavement I saw the merchant fast asleep and breathing heavily,","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1440",8129,"with his face and the palms of his hands towards the sky, and slaves were","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1441",8129,"fanning him to keep away the flies. And from the market-place I came to a","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1442",8129,"silver temple and then to a palace of onyx, and there were many wonders in","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1443",8129,"Perdondaris, and I would have stayed and seen them all, but as I came to","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1444",8129,"the outer wall of the city I suddenly saw in it a huge ivory gate. For a","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1445",8129,"while I paused and admired it, then I came nearer and perceived the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1446",8129,"dreadful truth. The gate was carved out of one solid piece!","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1447",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1448",8129,"I fled at once through the gateway and down to the ship, and even as I ran","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1449",8129,"I thought that I heard far off on the hills behind me the tramp of the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1450",8129,"fearful beast by whom that mass of ivory was shed, who was perhaps even","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1451",8129,"then looking for his other tusk. When I was on the ship again I felt","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1452",8129,"safer, and I said nothing to the sailors of what I had seen.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1453",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1454",8129,"And now the captain was gradually awakening. Now night was rolling up from","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1455",8129,"the East and North, and only the pinnacles of the towers of Perdondaris","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1456",8129,"still took the fallen sunlight. Then I went to the captain and told him","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1457",8129,"quietly of the thing I had seen. And he questioned me at once about the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1458",8129,"gate, in a low voice, that the sailors might not know; and I told him how","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1459",8129,"the weight of the thing was such that it could not have been brought from","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1460",8129,"afar, and the captain knew that it had not been there a year ago. We","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1461",8129,"agreed that such a beast could never have been killed by any assault of","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1462",8129,"man, and that the gate must have been a fallen tusk, and one fallen near","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1463",8129,"and recently. Therefore he decided that it were better to flee at once; so","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1464",8129,"he commanded, and the sailors went to the sails, and others raised the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1465",8129,"anchor to the deck, and just as the highest pinnacle of marble lost the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1466",8129,"last rays of the sun we left Perdondaris, that famous city. And night came","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1467",8129,"down and cloaked Perdondaris and hid it from our eyes, which as things","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1468",8129,"have happened will never see it again; for I have heard since that","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1469",8129,"something swift and wonderful has suddenly wrecked Perdondaris in a","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1470",8129,"day--towers, walls and people.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1471",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1472",8129,"And the night deepened over the River Yann, a night all white with stars.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1473",8129,"And with the night there rose the helmsman's song. As soon as he had","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1474",8129,"prayed he began to sing to cheer himself all through the lonely night. But","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1475",8129,"first he prayed, praying the helmsman's prayer. And this is what I","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1476",8129,"remember of it, rendered into English with a very feeble equivalent of the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1477",8129,"rhythm that seemed so resonant in those tropic nights.","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1487",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1491",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1492",8129,"So he prayed, and there was silence. And the sailors laid them down to","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1493",8129,"rest for the night. The silence deepened, and was only broken by the","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1494",8129,"ripples of Yann that lightly touched our prow. Sometimes some monster of","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1496",8129,"","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1499",8129,"And then his loneliness came upon the helmsman, and he began to sing. And","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1500",8129,"he sang the market songs of Durl and Duz, and the old dragon-legends of","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1505",8129,"jungle and came into the clear cold air above, and the great bands of","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1506",8129,"stars that look on Yann began to know the affairs of Durl and Duz, and of","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1508",8129,"had, and the loves that they had loved, and all the little things that","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1509",8129,"they had hoped to do. And as I lay wrapped up in skins and blankets,","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
"1510",8129,"listening to those songs, and watching the fantastic shapes of the great","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"

"1519",8129,"that had come upon him in the hot and scented jungle, and forgot its","A Dreamer's Tales","Dunsany, Lord","Fantasy","en"
