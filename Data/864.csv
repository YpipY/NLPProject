"1595",864,"without success, it was plain that her description had been often","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"1601",864,"answer but once, when he told me he and Teach had an understanding “which","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"1618",864,"the first locker.  There was a man there already; by the way he stirred","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"1619",864,"and threw me off, I could not think he was much in liquor; and yet when I","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"6127",864,"holding on with both hands to the grating of the cabin skylight; for it","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"6135",864,"as birds are said to look on snakes.  My mind, besides, was troubled with","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"6148",864,"","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6149",864,"“My friend the count,” it was thus that he began his story, “had for an","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6150",864,"enemy a certain German baron, a stranger in Rome.  It matters not what","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6151",864,"was the ground of the count’s enmity; but as he had a firm design to be","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6152",864,"revenged, and that with safety to himself, he kept it secret even from","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6153",864,"the baron.  Indeed, that is the first principle of vengeance; and hatred","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6154",864,"betrayed is hatred impotent.  The count was a man of a curious, searching","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6155",864,"mind; he had something of the artist; if anything fell for him to do, it","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6156",864,"must always be done with an exact perfection, not only as to the result,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6157",864,"but in the very means and instruments, or he thought the thing","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6158",864,"miscarried.  It chanced he was one day riding in the outer suburbs, when","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6159",864,"he came to a disused by-road branching off into the moor which lies about","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6160",864,"Rome.  On the one hand was an ancient Roman tomb; on the other a deserted","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6161",864,"house in a garden of evergreen trees.  This road brought him presently","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6162",864,"into a field of ruins, in the midst of which, in the side of a hill, he","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6163",864,"saw an open door, and, not far off, a single stunted pine no greater than","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6164",864,"a currant-bush.  The place was desert and very secret; a voice spoke in","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6165",864,"the count’s bosom that there was something here to his advantage.  He","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6166",864,"tied his horse to the pine-tree, took his flint and steel in his hand to","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6167",864,"make a light, and entered into the hill.  The doorway opened on a passage","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6168",864,"of old Roman masonry, which shortly after branched in two.  The count","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6169",864,"took the turning to the right, and followed it, groping forward in the","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6170",864,"dark, till he was brought up by a kind of fence, about elbow-high, which","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6171",864,"extended quite across the passage.  Sounding forward with his foot, he","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6172",864,"found an edge of polished stone, and then vacancy.  All his curiosity was","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6173",864,"now awakened, and, getting some rotten sticks that lay about the floor,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6174",864,"he made a fire.  In front of him was a profound well; doubtless some","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6175",864,"neighbouring peasant had once used it for his water, and it was he that","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6176",864,"had set up the fence.  A long while the count stood leaning on the rail","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6177",864,"and looking down into the pit.  It was of Roman foundation, and, like all","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6178",864,"that nation set their hands to, built as for eternity; the sides were","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6179",864,"still straight, and the joints smooth; to a man who should fall in, no","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6180",864,"escape was possible.  ‘Now,’ the count was thinking, ‘a strong impulsion","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6181",864,"brought me to this place.  What for? what have I gained? why should I be","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6182",864,"sent to gaze into this well?’ when the rail of the fence gave suddenly","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6183",864,"under his weight, and he came within an ace of falling headlong in.","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6184",864,"Leaping back to save himself, he trod out the last flicker of his fire,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6185",864,"which gave him thenceforward no more light, only an incommoding smoke.","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6186",864,"‘Was I sent here to my death?’ says he, and shook from head to foot.  And","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6187",864,"then a thought flashed in his mind.  He crept forth on hands and knees to","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6188",864,"the brink of the pit, and felt above him in the air.  The rail had been","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6189",864,"fast to a pair of uprights; it had only broken from the one, and still","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6190",864,"depended from the other.  The count set it back again as he had found it,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6191",864,"so that the place meant death to the first comer, and groped out of the","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6192",864,"catacomb like a sick man.  The next day, riding in the Corso with the","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6193",864,"baron, he purposely betrayed a strong preoccupation.  The other (as he","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6194",864,"had designed) inquired into the cause; and he, after some fencing,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6195",864,"admitted that his spirits had been dashed by an unusual dream.  This was","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6196",864,"calculated to draw on the baron—a superstitious man, who affected the","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6197",864,"scorn of superstition.  Some rallying followed, and then the count, as if","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6198",864,"suddenly carried away, called on his friend to beware, for it was of him","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6199",864,"that he had dreamed.  You know enough of human nature, my excellent","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6200",864,"Mackellar, to be certain of one thing: I mean that the baron did not rest","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6201",864,"till he had heard the dream.  The count, sure that he would never desist,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6202",864,"kept him in play till his curiosity was highly inflamed, and then","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6203",864,"suffered himself, with seeming reluctance, to be overborne.  ‘I warn","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6204",864,"you,’ says he, ‘evil will come of it; something tells me so.  But since","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6205",864,"there is to be no peace either for you or me except on this condition,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6206",864,"the blame be on your own head!  This was the dream:—I beheld you riding,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6207",864,"I know not where, yet I think it must have been near Rome, for on your","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6208",864,"one hand was an ancient tomb, and on the other a garden of evergreen","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6209",864,"trees.  Methought I cried and cried upon you to come back in a very agony","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6210",864,"of terror; whether you heard me I know not, but you went doggedly on.","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6211",864,"The road brought you to a desert place among ruins, where was a door in a","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6212",864,"hillside, and hard by the door a misbegotten pine.  Here you dismounted","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6213",864,"(I still crying on you to beware), tied your horse to the pine-tree, and","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6214",864,"entered resolutely in by the door.  Within, it was dark; but in my dream","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6215",864,"I could still see you, and still besought you to hold back.  You felt","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6216",864,"your way along the right-hand wall, took a branching passage to the","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6217",864,"right, and came to a little chamber, where was a well with a railing.  At","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6218",864,"this—I know not why—my alarm for you increased a thousandfold, so that I","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6219",864,"seemed to scream myself hoarse with warnings, crying it was still time,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6220",864,"and bidding you begone at once from that vestibule.  Such was the word I","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6221",864,"used in my dream, and it seemed then to have a clear significancy; but","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6222",864,"to-day, and awake, I profess I know not what it means.  To all my outcry","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6223",864,"you rendered not the least attention, leaning the while upon the rail and","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6224",864,"looking down intently in the water.  And then there was made to you a","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6225",864,"communication; I do not think I even gathered what it was, but the fear","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6226",864,"of it plucked me clean out of my slumber, and I awoke shaking and","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6227",864,"sobbing.  And now,’ continues the count, ‘I thank you from my heart for","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6228",864,"your insistency.  This dream lay on me like a load; and now I have told","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6229",864,"it in plain words and in the broad daylight, it seems no great","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6230",864,"matter.’—‘I do not know,’ says the baron.  ‘It is in some points strange.","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6231",864,"A communication, did you say?  Oh! it is an odd dream.  It will make a","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6232",864,"story to amuse our friends.’—‘I am not so sure,’ says the count.  ‘I am","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6233",864,"sensible of some reluctancy.  Let us rather forget it.’—‘By all means,’","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6234",864,"says the baron.  And (in fact) the dream was not again referred to.  Some","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6235",864,"days after, the count proposed a ride in the fields, which the baron","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6236",864,"(since they were daily growing faster friends) very readily accepted.  On","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6237",864,"the way back to Rome, the count led them insensibly by a particular","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6238",864,"route.  Presently he reined in his horse, clapped his hand before his","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6239",864,"eyes, and cried out aloud.  Then he showed his face again (which was now","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6240",864,"quite white, for he was a consummate actor), and stared upon the baron.","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6241",864,"‘What ails you?’ cries the baron.  ‘What is wrong with you?’—‘Nothing,’","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6242",864,"cries the count.  ‘It is nothing.  A seizure, I know not what.  Let us","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6243",864,"hurry back to Rome.’  But in the meanwhile the baron had looked about","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6244",864,"him; and there, on the left-hand side of the way as they went back to","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6245",864,"Rome, he saw a dusty by-road with a tomb upon the one hand and a garden","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6246",864,"of evergreen trees upon the other.—‘Yes,’ says he, with a changed voice.","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6247",864,"‘Let us by all means hurry back to Rome.  I fear you are not well in","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6248",864,"health.’—‘Oh, for God’s sake!’ cries the count, shuddering, ‘back to Rome","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6249",864,"and let me get to bed.’  They made their return with scarce a word; and","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6250",864,"the count, who should by rights have gone into society, took to his bed","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"6251",864,"and gave out he had a touch of country fever.  The next day the baron’s","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"7713",864,"that question, I have one to put to you.  It was this cur here, this","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"7714",864,"Harris, that speaks Hindustani?” cries he, rising on one knee and","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"7715",864,"pointing fair at the man’s face, with a gesture indescribably menacing;","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"7716",864,"and when he had been answered in the affirmative, “Ah!” says he, “then","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"7718",864,"men, hear the truth for the first time.”  Thereupon he launched forth in","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"7719",864,"a long story, told with extraordinary skill, how he had all along","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"7720",864,"suspected Harris, how he had found the confirmation of his fears, and how","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"7721",864,"Harris must have misrepresented what passed between Secundra and himself.","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"7749",864,"with his hands knit under his head and one knee flung across the other,","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"7751",864,"bravado carried him too far and prejudiced his case.  At least, after a","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
"7752",864,"cast or two back and forward, opinion settled finally against him.  It’s","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"

"7761",864,"rolled carelessly upon one side, which was done (in Mountain’s opinion)","The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale","Stevenson, Robert Louis","Historical Fiction","en"
