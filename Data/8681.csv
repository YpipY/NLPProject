"82",8681,"Lurine, was pretty, _petite_, and eighteen. She had a nice","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"83",8681,"situation at the Pharmacie de Siam, in the Rue St. Honore. She had no","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"84",8681,"one dependent upon her, and all the money she earned was her own. Her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"85",8681,"dress was of cheap material perhaps, but it was cut and fitted with","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"86",8681,"that daintiness of perfection which seems to be the natural gift of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"87",8681,"Parisienne, so that one never thought of the cheapness, but admired","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"88",8681,"only the effect, which was charming. She was book-keeper and general","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"89",8681,"assistant at the Pharmacie, and had a little room of her own across the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"90",8681,"Seine, in the Rue de Lille. She crossed the river twice every day--once","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"91",8681,"in the morning when the sun was shining, and again at night when the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"92",8681,"radiant lights along the river's bank glittered like jewels in a long","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"93",8681,"necklace. She had her little walk through the Gardens of the Tuileries","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"94",8681,"every morning after crossing the Pont Royal, but she did not return","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"95",8681,"through the gardens in the evening, for a park in the morning is a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"96",8681,"different thing to a park at night. On her return she always walked","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"97",8681,"along the Rue de Tuileries until she came to the bridge. Her morning","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"98",8681,"ramble through the gardens was a daily delight to her, for the Rue de","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"99",8681,"Lille is narrow, and not particularly bright, so it was pleasant to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"100",8681,"walk beneath the green trees, to feel the crisp gravel under her feet,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"101",8681,"and to see the gleaming white statues in the sunlight, with the sparkle","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"102",8681,"on the round fountain pond, by the side of which she sometimes sat. Her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"103",8681,"favorite statue was one of a woman that stood on a pedestal near the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"104",8681,"Rue de Rivoli. The arm was thrown over her head, and there was a smile","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"105",8681,"on the marble face which was inscrutable. It fascinated the girl as she","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"106",8681,"looked up to it, and seemed to be the morning greeting to her busy","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"107",8681,"day's work in the city. If no one was in sight, which was often the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"108",8681,"case at eight o'clock in the morning, the girl kissed the tips of her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"109",8681,"fingers, and tossed the salute airily up to the statue, and the woman","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"110",8681,"of stone always smiled back at her the strange mystical smile which","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"111",8681,"seemed to indicate that it knew much more of this world and its ways","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"112",8681,"than did the little Parisienne who daily gazed up at her.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"113",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"114",8681,"Lurine was happy, as a matter of course, for was not Paris always","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"115",8681,"beautiful? Did not the sun shine brightly? And was not the air always","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"116",8681,"clear? What more, then, could a young girl wish? There was one thing","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"117",8681,"which was perhaps lacking, but that at last was supplied; and then","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"118",8681,"there was not a happier girl in all Paris than Lurine. She almost cried","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"119",8681,"it aloud to her favorite statue the next morning, for it seemed to her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"120",8681,"that the smile had broadened since she had passed it the morning","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"121",8681,"before, and she felt as if the woman of stone had guessed the secret of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"122",8681,"the woman of flesh.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"123",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"124",8681,"Lurine had noticed him for several days hovering about the Pharmacie,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"125",8681,"and looking in at her now and then; she saw it all, but pretended not","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"126",8681,"to see. He was a handsome young fellow with curly hair, and hands long,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"127",8681,"slender, and white as if he were not accustomed to doing hard, manual","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"128",8681,"labor. One night he followed her as far as the bridge, but she walked","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"129",8681,"rapidly on, and he did not overtake her. He never entered the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"130",8681,"Pharmacie, but lingered about as if waiting for a chance to speak with","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"131",8681,"her. Lurine had no one to confide in but the woman of stone, and it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"132",8681,"seemed by her smile that she understood already, and there was no need","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"133",8681,"to tell her, that the inevitable young man had come. The next night he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"134",8681,"followed her quite across the bridge, and this time Lurine did not walk","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"135",8681,"so quickly. Girls in her position are not supposed to have normal","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"136",8681,"introductions to their lovers, and are generally dependent upon a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"137",8681,"haphazard acquaintance, although that Lurine did not know. The young","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"138",8681,"man spoke to her on the bridge, raising his hat from his black head as","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"139",8681,"he did so.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"140",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"141",8681,"""Good evening!"" was all he said to her.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"142",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"143",8681,"She glanced sideways shyly at him, but did not answer, and the young","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"144",8681,"man walked on beside her.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"145",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"146",8681,"""You come this way every night,"" he said. ""I have been watching you.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"147",8681,"Are you offended?""","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"148",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"149",8681,"""No,"" she answered, almost in a whisper.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"150",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"151",8681,"""Then may I walk with you to your home?"" he asked.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"152",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"153",8681,"""You may walk with me as far as the corner of the Rue de Lille,"" she","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"154",8681,"replied.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"155",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"156",8681,"""Thank you!"" said the young fellow, and together they walked the short","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"157",8681,"distance, and there he bade her good night, after asking permission to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"158",8681,"meet her at the corner of the Rue St. Honore, and walk home with her,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"159",8681,"the next night.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"160",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"161",8681,"""You must not come to the shop,"" she said.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"162",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"163",8681,"""I understand,"" he replied, nodding his head in assent to her wishes.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"164",8681,"He told her his name was Jean Duret, and by-and-by she called him Jean,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"165",8681,"and he called her Lurine. He never haunted the Pharmacie now, but","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"166",8681,"waited for her at the corner, and one Sunday he took her for a little","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"167",8681,"excursion on the river, which she enjoyed exceedingly. Thus time went","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"168",8681,"on, and Lurine was very happy. The statue smiled its enigmatical smile,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"169",8681,"though, when the sky was overcast, there seemed to her a subtle warning","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"170",8681,"in the smile. Perhaps it was because they had quarrelled the night","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"171",8681,"before. Jean had seemed to her harsh and unforgiving. He had asked her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"172",8681,"if she could not bring him some things from the Pharmacie, and gave her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"173",8681,"a list of three chemicals, the names of which he had written on a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"174",8681,"paper.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"175",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"176",8681,"""You can easily get them,"" he had said; ""they are in every Pharmacie,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"177",8681,"and will never be missed.""","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"178",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"179",8681,"""But,"" said the girl in horror, ""that would be stealing.""","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"180",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"181",8681,"The young man laughed.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"182",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"183",8681,"""How much do they pay you there?"" he asked. And when she told him, he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"184",8681,"laughed again and said,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"185",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"186",8681,"""Why, bless you, if I got so little as that I would take something from","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"187",8681,"the shelves every day and sell it.""","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"188",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"189",8681,"The girl looked at him in amazement, and he, angry at her, turned upon","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"190",8681,"his heel and left her. She leaned her arms upon the parapet of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"191",8681,"bridge, and looked down into the dark water. The river always","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"192",8681,"fascinated her at night, and she often paused to look at it when","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"193",8681,"crossing the bridge, shuddering as she did so. She cried a little as","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"194",8681,"she thought of his abrupt departure, and wondered if she had been too","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"195",8681,"harsh with him. After all, it was not very much he had asked her to do,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"196",8681,"and they did pay her so little at the Pharmacie. And then perhaps her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"197",8681,"lover was poor, and needed the articles he had asked her to get.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"198",8681,"Perhaps he was ill, and had said nothing. There was a touch on her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"199",8681,"shoulder. She looked round. Jean was standing beside her, but the frown","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"200",8681,"had not yet disappeared from his brow.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"201",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"202",8681,"""Give me that paper,"" he said, abruptly.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"204",8681,"She unclosed her hand, and he picked the paper from it, and was turning","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"206",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"354",8681,"not daring to enter. She walked in the rain along the Rue des","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"355",8681,"Pyramides, and across the Rue de Rivoli, and into the Tuileries","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"357",8681,"her steps were directed to her. She looked up at her statue with","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"358",8681,"amazement, at first not recognizing it. It was no longer the statue of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"360",8681,"mortal agony was on the face. It was a ghastly monument to Death. The","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"361",8681,"girl was so perplexed by the change in her statue that for the moment","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"362",8681,"she forgot the ruin of her own life. She saw that the smiling face was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"365",8681,"but the smiling face, sees but the half of life. The girl hurried on to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"366",8681,"the bridge, sobbing quietly to herself, and looked down at the grey","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"367",8681,"river water. The passers-by paid no attention to her. Why, she","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"368",8681,"wondered, had she ever thought the river cold and cruel and merciless?","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"369",8681,"It is the only home of the homeless, the only lover that does not","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"651",8681,"then something on the anvil appeared to catch his eye. He bent over it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"652",8681,"and looked critically on the surface of the iron. Drawing himself up to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"1459",8681,"was undoubted, after several glasses varying in number according to the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1460",8681,"strength of their contents, and a man who had heard the great political","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"1462",8681,"Joe when he got on the subject of the wrongs of the working man and the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1463",8681,"tyranny of the capitalist. It was generally understood that Joe might","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1464",8681,"have been anything he liked, and that he was no man's enemy but his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1465",8681,"own. It was also hinted that he could tell the bigwigs a thing or two","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"1471",8681,"woman stood with her back to the brick wall, horror-stricken at the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"1473",8681,"self-imposed mission was among these people, but she had never seen Joe","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1474",8681,"taken to the station before, and the sight, which was so amusing to the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1475",8681,"neighborhood, was shocking to her. She enquired about Joe, and heard","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1476",8681,"the usual story that he was no man's enemy but his own, although they","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1477",8681,"might in justice have added the police. Still, a policeman was hardly","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1478",8681,"looked upon as a human being in that neighborhood. Miss Johnson","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1479",8681,"reported the case to the committee of the Social League, and took","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1480",8681,"counsel. Then it was that the reclamation of Joe Hollends was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1481",8681,"determined on.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1482",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1483",8681,"Joe received Miss Johnson with subdued dignity, and a demeanor that","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1484",8681,"delicately indicated a knowledge on his part of her superiority and his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1485",8681,"own degradation. He knew how a lady should be treated even if he was a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1486",8681,"drunkard, as he told his cronies afterwards. Joe was perfectly willing","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1487",8681,"to be reclaimed. Heretofore in his life, no one had ever extended the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1488",8681,"hand of fellowship to him. Human sympathy was what Joe needed, and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1489",8681,"precious little he had had of it. There were more kicks than halfpence","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1490",8681,"in this world for a poor man. The rich did not care what became of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"1495",8681,"clothes and endeavor to find him a place where work would enable him to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1496",8681,"help himself. Miss Johnson went around the neighborhood and collected","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"1865",8681,"him? He knew no one to invite to the house or to ride with him in the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1866",8681,"carriage. He began to realize how utterly alone in the world he was. He","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1867",8681,"had no friends, no acquaintances even. The running dog, with its nose","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1868",8681,"to the ground, sees nothing of the surrounding scenery. He knew men in","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1869",8681,"a business way, of course, and doubtless each of them had a home in the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1870",8681,"suburbs somewhere, but he could not take a business man by the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1871",8681,"shoulders and say to him, ""Invite me to your house; I am lonely; I want","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1872",8681,"to know people.""","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1873",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1874",8681,"If he got such an invitation, he would not know what to do with","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1875",8681,"himself. He was familiar with the counting-room and its language, but","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1876",8681,"the drawing-room was an unexplored country to him, where an unknown","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1877",8681,"tongue was spoken. On the road to wealth he had missed something, and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1878",8681,"it was now too late to go back for it. Only the day before, he had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1879",8681,"heard one of the clerks, who did not know he was within earshot, allude","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1880",8681,"to him as ""the old man."" He felt as young as ever he did, but the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1881",8681,"phrase, so lightly spoken, made him catch his breath.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1882",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1883",8681,"As he was now walking through the park, and away from the busy streets,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1884",8681,"he took off his hat and ran his fingers through his grizzled hair,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1885",8681,"looking at his hand when he had done so, as if the grey, like wet","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1886",8681,"paint, might have come off. He thought of a girl he knew once, who","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1887",8681,"perhaps would have married him if he had asked her, as he was tempted","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1888",8681,"to do. But that had always been the mistake of the Denhams. They had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1889",8681,"all married young except himself, and so sunk deeper into the mire of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1890",8681,"poverty, pressed down by a rapidly-increasing progeny. The girl had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1891",8681,"married a baker, he remembered. Yes, that was a long time ago. The","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1892",8681,"clerk was not far wrong when he called him an old man. Suddenly,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1893",8681,"another girl arose before his mental vision--a modern girl--very","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1894",8681,"different indeed to the one who married the baker. She was the only","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1895",8681,"woman in the world with whom he was on speaking terms, and he knew her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1896",8681,"merely because her light and nimble fingers played the business sonata","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1897",8681,"of one note on his office typewriter. Miss Gale was pretty, of course--","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1898",8681,"all typewriter girls are--and it was generally understood in the office","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1899",8681,"that she belonged to a good family who had come down in the world. Her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1900",8681,"somewhat independent air deepened this conviction and kept the clerks","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1901",8681,"at a distance. She was a sensible girl who realized that the typewriter","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1902",8681,"paid better than the piano, and accordingly turned the expertness of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1903",8681,"her white fingers to the former instrument. Richard Denham sat down","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1904",8681,"upon a park bench. ""Why not?"" he asked himself. There was no reason","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1905",8681,"against it except that he felt he had not the courage. Nevertheless, he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1906",8681,"formed a desperate resolution.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1907",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1908",8681,"Next day, business went on as usual. Letters were answered, and the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1909",8681,"time arrived when Miss Gale came in to see if he had any further","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1910",8681,"commands that day. Denham hesitated. He felt vaguely that a business","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1911",8681,"office was not the proper place for a proposal; yet he knew he would be","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1912",8681,"at a disadvantage anywhere else. In the first place, he had no","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"1913",8681,"plausible excuse for calling upon the young woman at home, and, in the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2296",8681,"in particular, which through local peculiarities differed from all","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2297",8681,"others. A fog was simply watery vapor rising from the marshy surface of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2298",8681,"the land or from the sea, or condensed into a cloud from the saturated","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2299",8681,"atmosphere. In my day, fogs were a great danger at sea, for people then","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2303",8681,"London at the end of the 19th century consumed vast quantities of a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2304",8681,"soft bituminous coal for the purpose of heating rooms and of preparing","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2305",8681,"food. In the morning and during the day, clouds of black smoke were","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2306",8681,"poured forth from thousands of chimneys. When a mass of white vapor","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2307",8681,"arose in the night these clouds of smoke fell upon the fog, pressing it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2308",8681,"down, filtering slowly through it, and adding to its density. The sun","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2309",8681,"would have absorbed the fog but for the layer of smoke that lay thick","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2310",8681,"above the vapor and prevented the rays reaching it. Once this condition","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2311",8681,"of things prevailed, nothing could clear London but a breeze of wind","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2312",8681,"from any direction. London frequently had a seven days' fog, and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2313",8681,"sometimes a seven days' calm, but these two conditions never coincided","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2329",8681,"apparatus. Fulton I never knew; he died long before my time. Sir John","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2330",8681,"Brixton was my chief, knighted, I believe, for services to his party,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2331",8681,"or because he was an official in the City during some royal progress","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2332",8681,"through it; I have forgotten which. My small room was next to his large","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2333",8681,"one, and my chief duty was to see that no one had an interview with Sir","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2334",8681,"John unless he was an important man or had important business. Sir John","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2335",8681,"was a difficult man to see, and a difficult man to deal with when he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2336",8681,"was seen. He had little respect for most men's feelings, and none at","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2337",8681,"all for mine. If I allowed a man to enter his room who should have been","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2338",8681,"dealt with by one of the minor members of the company, Sir John made no","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2339",8681,"effort to conceal his opinion of me. One day, in the autumn of the last","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2340",8681,"year of the century, an American was shown into my room. Nothing would","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2341",8681,"do but he must have an interview with Sir John Brixton. I told him that","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2342",8681,"it was impossible, as Sir John was extremely busy, but that if he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2343",8681,"explained his business to me I would lay it before Sir John at the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2344",8681,"first favorable opportunity. The American demurred at this, but finally","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2345",8681,"accepted the inevitable. He was the inventor, he said, of a machine","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2346",8681,"that would revolutionize life in London, and he wanted Fulton, Brixton","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2347",8681,"& Co. to become agents for it. The machine, which he had in a small","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2348",8681,"handbag with him, was of white metal, and it was so constructed that by","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2349",8681,"turning an index it gave out greater or less volumes of oxygen gas. The","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2350",8681,"gas, I understood, was stored in the interior in liquid form under","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2351",8681,"great pressure, and would last, if I remember rightly, for six months","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2352",8681,"without recharging. There was also a rubber tube with a mouthpiece","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2353",8681,"attached to it, and the American said that if a man took a few whiffs a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2354",8681,"day, he would experience beneficial results. Now, I knew there was not","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2355",8681,"the slightest use in showing the machine to Sir John, because we dealt","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2356",8681,"in old-established British apparatus, and never in any of the new-","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2357",8681,"fangled Yankee contraptions. Besides, Sir John had a prejudice against","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2358",8681,"Americans, and I felt sure this man would exasperate him, as he was a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2359",8681,"most cadaverous specimen of the race, with high nasal tones, and a most","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2360",8681,"deplorable pronunciation, much given to phrases savoring of slang; and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2361",8681,"he exhibited also a certain nervous familiarity of demeanor towards","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2362",8681,"people to whom he was all but a complete stranger. It was impossible","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2363",8681,"for me to allow such a man to enter the presence of Sir John Brixton,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2364",8681,"and when he returned some days later I explained to him, I hope with","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2365",8681,"courtesy, that the head of the house regretted very much his inability","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2366",8681,"to consider his proposal regarding the machine. The ardor of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2367",8681,"American seemed in no way dampened by this rebuff. He said I could not","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2368",8681,"have explained the possibilities of the apparatus properly to Sir John;","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2369",8681,"he characterized it as a great invention, and said it meant a fortune","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2370",8681,"to whoever obtained the agency for it. He hinted that other noted","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2371",8681,"London houses were anxious to secure it, but for some reason not stated","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2372",8681,"he preferred to deal with us. He left some printed pamphlets referring","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2383",8681,"unidentified thousands who were buried in unmarked graves. Little did","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2384",8681,"Sir John think when he expelled him with some asperity from his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2385",8681,"presence, that he was turning away an offer of life, and that the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2386",8681,"heated words he used were, in reality, a sentence of death upon","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2388",8681,"American his business methods did not commend themselves to me. Perhaps","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2389",8681,"he did not feel the sting of this; indeed, I feel certain he did not,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2390",8681,"for, unknowingly, he saved my life. Be that as it may, he showed no","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2391",8681,"resentment, but immediately asked me out to drink with him, an offer I","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2392",8681,"was compelled to refuse. But I am getting ahead of my story. Indeed,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2393",8681,"being unaccustomed to writing, it is difficult for me to set down","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2394",8681,"events in their proper sequence. The American called upon me several","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2395",8681,"times after I told him our house could not deal with him. He got into","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2396",8681,"the habit of dropping in upon me unannounced, which I did not at all","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2397",8681,"like, but I gave no instructions regarding his intrusions, because I","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2398",8681,"had no idea of the extremes to which he was evidently prepared to go.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2399",8681,"One day, as he sat near my desk reading a paper, I was temporarily","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2400",8681,"called from the room. When I returned I thought he had gone, taking his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2401",8681,"machine with him, but a moment later I was shocked to hear his high","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2402",8681,"nasal tones in Sir John's room alternating with the deep notes of my","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2403",8681,"chief's voice, which apparently exercised no such dread upon the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2404",8681,"American as upon those who were more accustomed to them. I at once","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2405",8681,"entered the room, and was about to explain to Sir John that the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2406",8681,"American was there through no connivance of mine, when my chief asked","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2407",8681,"me to be silent, and, turning to his visitor, gruffly requested him to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2408",8681,"proceed with his interesting narration. The inventor needed no second","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2409",8681,"invitation, but went on with his glib talk, while Sir John's frown grew","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2410",8681,"deeper, and his face became redder under his fringe of white hair. When","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2411",8681,"the American had finished, Sir John roughly bade him begone, and take","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2412",8681,"his accursed machine with him. He said it was an insult for a person","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2413",8681,"with one foot in the grave to bring a so-called health invention to a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2414",8681,"robust man who never had a day's illness, I do not know why he listened","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2415",8681,"so long to the American, when he had made up his mind from the first","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2416",8681,"not to deal with him, unless it was to punish me for inadvertently","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2417",8681,"allowing the stranger to enter. The interview distressed me","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2418",8681,"exceedingly, as I stood there helpless, knowing Sir John was becoming","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2419",8681,"more and more angry with every word the foreigner uttered, but, at","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2420",8681,"last, I succeeded in drawing the inventor and his work into my own room","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2421",8681,"and closing the door. I sincerely hoped I would never see the American","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2422",8681,"again, and my wish was gratified. He insisted on setting his machine","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2423",8681,"going, and placing it on a shelf in my room. He asked me to slip it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2424",8681,"into Sir John's room some foggy day and note the effect. The man said","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2434",8681,"fine up to the middle of November that autumn. The fog did not seem to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2435",8681,"have anything unusual about it. I have seen many worse fogs than that","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2436",8681,"appeared to be. As day followed day, however, the atmosphere became","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2437",8681,"denser and darker, caused, I suppose, by the increasing volume of coal-","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2438",8681,"smoke poured out upon it. The peculiarity about those seven days was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2439",8681,"the intense stillness of the air. We were, although we did not know it,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2440",8681,"under an air-proof canopy, and were slowly but surely exhausting the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2441",8681,"life-giving oxygen around us, and replacing it by poisonous carbonic","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2442",8681,"acid gas. Scientific men have since showed that a simple mathematical","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2443",8681,"calculation might have told us exactly when the last atom of oxygen","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2445",8681,"The body of the greatest mathematician in England was found in the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2455",8681,"the sixth day experienced no inconvenience from the fog, and this was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2456",8681,"largely due, I am convinced, to the unnoticed operations of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2461",8681,"was closed. Shortly after ten o'clock I heard a cry in his room,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2467",8681,"own room, where the oppression was at once lifted, and I stood again","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2474",8681,"and others sat with their heads on their desks as if asleep. Even at","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2475",8681,"this awful moment I did not realize that what I saw was common to all","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2476",8681,"London, and not, as I imagined, a local disaster, caused by the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2477",8681,"breaking of some carboys in our cellar. (It was filled with chemicals","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2478",8681,"of every kind, of whose properties I was ignorant, dealing as I did","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2479",8681,"with the accountant, and not the scientific side of our business.) I","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2480",8681,"opened the only window in my room, and again shouted for help. The","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2481",8681,"street was silent and dark in the ominously still fog, and what now","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2482",8681,"froze me with horror was meeting the same deadly, stifling atmosphere","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2483",8681,"that was in the rooms. In falling I brought down the window, and shut","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2484",8681,"out the poisonous air. Again I revived, and slowly the true state of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2485",8681,"things began to dawn upon me.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2486",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2487",8681,"I was in an oasis of oxygen. I at once surmised that the machine on my","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2488",8681,"shelf was responsible for the existence of this oasis in a vast desert","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2489",8681,"of deadly gas. I took down the American's machine, fearful in moving it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2490",8681,"that I might stop its working. Taking the mouthpiece between my lips I","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2491",8681,"again entered Sir John's room, this time without feeling any ill","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2492",8681,"effects. My poor master was long beyond human help. There was evidently","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2493",8681,"no one alive in the building except myself. Out in the street all was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2494",8681,"silent and dark. The gas was extinguished, but here and there in shops","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2495",8681,"the incandescent lights were still weirdly burning, depending, as they","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2496",8681,"did, on accumulators, and not on direct engine power. I turned","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2497",8681,"automatically towards Cannon Street Station, knowing my way to it even","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2498",8681,"if blindfolded, stumbling over bodies prone on the pavement, and in","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2520",8681,"resting-place on account of its weight; but such was not the fact. I","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2521",8681,"imagine that a current through the tunnel brought from the outlying","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2522",8681,"districts a supply of comparatively pure air that, for some minutes","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2523",8681,"after the general disaster, maintained human life. Be this as it may,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2524",8681,"the long platforms of Cannon Street Underground Station presented a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2525",8681,"fearful spectacle. A train stood at the down platform. The electric","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2526",8681,"lights burned fitfully. This platform was crowded with men, who fought","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2527",8681,"each other like demons, apparently for no reason, because the train was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2528",8681,"already packed as full as it could hold. Hundreds were dead under foot,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2529",8681,"and every now and then a blast of foul air came along the tunnel,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2530",8681,"whereupon hundreds more would relax their grips, and succumb. Over","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2531",8681,"their bodies the survivors fought, with continually thinning ranks. It","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2532",8681,"seemed to me that most of those in the standing train were dead.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2533",8681,"Sometimes a desperate body of fighters climbed over those lying in","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2534",8681,"heaps and, throwing open a carriage door, hauled out passengers already","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2535",8681,"in, and took their places, gasping. Those in the train offered no","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2536",8681,"resistance, and lay motionless where they were flung, or rolled","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2537",8681,"helplessly under the wheels of the train. I made my way along the wall","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2538",8681,"as well as I could to the engine, wondering why the train did not go.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2539",8681,"The engineer lay on the floor of his cab, and the fires were out.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2540",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2541",8681,"Custom is a curious thing. The struggling mob, fighting wildly for","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2542",8681,"places in the carriages, were so accustomed to trains arriving and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2543",8681,"departing that it apparently occurred to none of them that the engineer","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2544",8681,"was human and subject to the same atmospheric conditions as themselves.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2545",8681,"I placed the mouthpiece between his purple lips, and, holding my own","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2546",8681,"breath like a submerged man, succeeded in reviving him. He said that if","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2547",8681,"I gave him the machine he would take out the train as far as the steam","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2548",8681,"already in the boiler would carry it. I refused to do this, but stepped","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2549",8681,"on the engine with him, saying it would keep life in both of us until","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2550",8681,"we got out into better air. In a surly manner he agreed to this and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2551",8681,"started the train, but he did not play fair. Each time he refused to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2552",8681,"give up the machine until I was in a fainting condition with holding in","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2553",8681,"my breath, and, finally, he felled me to the floor of the cab. I","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2554",8681,"imagine that the machine rolled off the train as I fell and that he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2555",8681,"jumped after it. The remarkable thing is that neither of us needed the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2556",8681,"machine, for I remember that just after we started I noticed through","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2557",8681,"the open iron door that the engine fire suddenly became aglow again,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2558",8681,"although at the time I was in too great a state of bewilderment and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2559",8681,"horror to understand what it meant. A western gale had sprung up--an","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2560",8681,"hour too late. Even before we left Cannon Street those who still","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2561",8681,"survived were comparatively safe, for one hundred and sixty-seven","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2562",8681,"persons were rescued from that fearful heap of dead on the platforms,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2563",8681,"although many died within a day or two after, and others never","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2564",8681,"recovered their reason. When I regained my senses after the blow dealt","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2565",8681,"by the engineer, I found myself alone, and the train speeding across","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2566",8681,"the Thames near Kew. I tried to stop the engine, but did not succeed.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2567",8681,"However, in experimenting, I managed to turn on the air brake, which in","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2568",8681,"some degree checked the train, and lessened the impact when the crash","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2569",8681,"came at Richmond terminus. I sprang off on the platform before the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2570",8681,"engine reached the terminal buffers, and saw passing me like a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2571",8681,"nightmare the ghastly trainload of the dead. Most of the doors were","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2572",8681,"swinging open, and every compartment was jammed full, although, as I","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2573",8681,"afterwards learned, at each curve of the permanent way, or extra lurch","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2574",8681,"of the train, bodies had fallen out all along the line. The smash at","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2575",8681,"Richmond made no difference to the passengers. Besides myself, only two","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2576",8681,"persons were taken alive from the train, and one of these, his clothes","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2591",8681,"for a man--especially a young man--to attend to his own business.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2594",8681,"made for that unknown quantity--woman. Third: it is beneficial to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2595",8681,"remember that one man rarely knows everything. Other morals will","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2596",8681,"doubtless present themselves, and at the end the cynically-inclined","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2597",8681,"person may reflect upon the adage about the frying-pan and the fire.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2599",8681,"Young M. de Plonville of Paris enjoyed a most enviable position. He had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2600",8681,"all the money he needed, which is quite a different thing from saying","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2601",8681,"he had all the money he wanted. He was well educated, and spoke three","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2603",8681,"as a man always prides himself on what he is least able to do, De","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2604",8681,"Plonville fancied himself a linguist. His courage in speaking English","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2605",8681,"to Englishmen and German to Germans showed that he was, at least, a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2606",8681,"brave man. There was a great deal of good and even of talent in De","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2607",8681,"Plonville. This statement is made at the beginning, because everyone","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2608",8681,"who knows De Plonville will at once unhesitatingly contradict it. His","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2610",8681,"Paris, and naval officers, when his name was mentioned, usually gave","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2611",8681,"themselves over to strong and unjustifiable language. This was all on","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2612",8681,"account of De Plonville's position, which, although enviable had its","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2617",8681,"method of giving force to his suggestions. His father was a very big","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2618",8681,"man in the French Government. He was so big a man that he could send a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2619",8681,"censure to the commander of a squadron in the navy, and the commander","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2620",8681,"dare not talk back. It takes a very big man indeed to do this, and that","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2621",8681,"was the elder De Plonville's size. But then it was well known that the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2622",8681,"elder De Plonville was an easy-going man who loved comfort, and did not","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2623",8681,"care to trouble himself too much about the navy in his charge, and so","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2624",8681,"when there was trouble, young De Plonville got the credit of it;","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2625",8681,"consequently, the love of the officers did not flow out to him.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2626",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2627",8681,"Often young De Plonville's idiotic impetuosity gave color to these","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2628",8681,"suspicions. For instance, there is the well-known Toulon incident. In a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2629",8681,"heated controversy young De Plonville had claimed that the firing of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2630",8681,"the French ironclads was something execrable, and that the whole fleet","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2631",8681,"could not hold their own at the cannon with any ten of the British","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2632",8681,"navy. Some time after, the naval officers learned that the Government","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2633",8681,"at Paris was very much displeased with the inaccurate gun practice of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2634",8681,"the fleet, and the hope was expressed that the commander would see his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2635",8681,"way to improving it. Of course, the officers could do nothing but gnash","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2636",8681,"their teeth, try to shoot better, and hope for a time to come when the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2637",8681,"Government then in power would be out, and they could find some","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2640",8681,"All this has only a remote bearing upon this story, but we now come to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2641",8681,"a matter on which the story sinks or swims. De Plonville had a secret--","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2642",8681,"not such a secret as is common in Parisian life, but one entirely","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2643",8681,"creditable to him. It related to an invention intended to increase the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2644",8681,"efficiency of the French army. The army being a branch of the defences","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2645",8681,"of his country with which De Plonville had nothing whatever to do, his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2646",8681,"attention naturally turned towards it. He spoke of this invention,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2647",8681,"once, to a friend, a lieutenant in the army. He expected to get some","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2648",8681,"practical suggestions. He never mentioned it again to anyone.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2649",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2650",8681,"""It is based on the principle of the umbrella,"" he said to his friend;","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2651",8681,"""in fact, it was the umbrella that suggested it to me. If it could be","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2652",8681,"made very light so as not to add seriously to the impedimenta at","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2653",8681,"present carried by the soldier, it seems to me it would be exceedingly","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2654",8681,"useful. Instead of being circular as an umbrella is, it must be oblong","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2655",8681,"with sharp ends. It would have to be arranged so as to be opened and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2656",8681,"closed quickly, with the cloth thin, but impervious to water. When the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2660",8681,"added but little to the weight, thus saving the building of temporary","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2684",8681,"This conversation caused young De Plonville to make two resolutions;","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2685",8681,"first, to mention his scheme to no one; second, to persevere and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2686",8681,"perfect his invention, thus causing confusion to the scoffer. There","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2687",8681,"were several sub-resolutions dependent on these two. He would not enter","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2699",8681,"Paris and the environs thereof were manifestly impossible. He needed a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2707",8681,"in making a confidant of any army man.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2711",8681,"east. There was left the Mediterranean. He thought rapidly of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2712",8681,"different delightful spots along the Riviera--Cannes, St. Raphael,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2713",8681,"Nice, Monte Carlo,--but all of these were too public and too much","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2714",8681,"thronged with visitors. The name of the place came to him suddenly,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2715",8681,"and, as he stopped his march to and fro, De Plonville wondered why it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2716",8681,"had not suggested itself to him at the very first. Hyeres! It seemed to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2717",8681,"have been planned in the Middle Ages for the perfecting of just such an","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2718",8681,"invention. It was situated two or three miles back from the sea, the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2719",8681,"climate was perfect, there was no marine parade, the sea coast was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2720",8681,"lonely, and the bay sheltered by the islands. It was an ideal spot.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2721",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2722",8681,"De Plonville easily secured leave of absence. Sons of fathers high up","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2723",8681,"in the service of a grateful country seldom have any difficulty about a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2724",8681,"little thing like that. He purchased a ticket for that leisurely train","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2725",8681,"which the French with their delicious sense of humor call the ""Rapide,""","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2726",8681,"and in due time found himself with his various belongings standing on","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"2728",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2729",8681,"Few of us are as brave as we think ourselves. De Plonville flinched","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2730",8681,"when the supreme moment came, and perhaps that is why the Gods punished","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2731",8681,"him. He had resolved to go to one of the country inns at Carqueyranne","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2732",8681,"on the coast, but this was in a heroic mood when the lieutenant had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2733",8681,"laughed at his project. Now in a cooler moment he thought of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2734",8681,"cuisine of Carqueyranne and shuddered. There are sacrifices which no","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2735",8681,"man should be called upon to endure, so the naval officer hesitated,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2736",8681,"and at last directed the porter to put his luggage on the top of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2737",8681,"Costebelle Hotel ""bus."" There would be society at the hotel it is true,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2738",8681,"but he could avoid it, while if he went to the rural tavern he could","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2739",8681,"not avoid the cooking. Thus he smothered his conscience. Lunch at","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2740",8681,"Costebelle seemed to justify his choice of an abiding-place. The","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2741",8681,"surroundings of the hotel were dangerously charming to a man whose","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2742",8681,"natural inclination was towards indolent enjoyment. It was a place to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2743",8681,"""Loaf and invite your soul,"" as Walt Whitman phrases it. Plonville, who","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2744",8681,"was there incognito, for he had temporarily dropped the ""De,"" strolled","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2745",8681,"towards the sea in the afternoon, with the air of one who has nothing","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2746",8681,"on his mind. No one to see him would have suspected he was the future","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2747",8681,"Edison of France. When he reached the coast at the ruins of the ancient","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2748",8681,"Roman naval station called Pomponiana, he smote his thigh with joy. He","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2749",8681,"had forgotten that at this spot there had been erected a number of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2750",8681,"little wooden houses, each larger than a bathing-machine and smaller","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2751",8681,"than a cottage, which were used in summer by the good people of Hyeres,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2752",8681,"and in winter were silently vacant. The largest of these would be","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2753",8681,"exactly the place for him, and he knew he would have no difficulty in","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2754",8681,"renting it for a month or two. Here, he could bring down his half-","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2755",8681,"finished invention; here, work at it all day unmolested; and here test","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2756",8681,"its sailing qualities with no onlookers.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2757",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2758",8681,"He walked up the road, and hailed the ancient bus which jogs along","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2759",8681,"between Toulon and Hyeres by way of the coast; mounted beside the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2760",8681,"driver, and speedily got information about the owner of the cottages at","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2761",8681,"Pomponiana.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2762",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2763",8681,"As he expected, he had no difficulty in arranging with the proprietor","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2764",8681,"for the largest of the little cottages, but he thought he detected a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2765",8681,"slight depression on the right eyelid as that person handed him the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2766",8681,"key. Had the owner suspected his purpose? he asked himself anxiously,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2767",8681,"as he drove back from the town to Costebelle. Impossible. He felt,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2768",8681,"however, that he could not be too secret about his intentions. He had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2769",8681,"heard of inventors being forestalled just at the very moment of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2770",8681,"success.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2771",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2772",8681,"He bade the driver wait, and placed that part of his luggage in the cab","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2773",8681,"which consisted of his half-finished invention and the materials for","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2774",8681,"completing it. Then he drove to the coast, and after placing the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2775",8681,"packages on the ground, paid and dismissed the man. When the cab was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2776",8681,"out of sight, he carried the things to the cottage and locked them in.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2777",8681,"His walk up the hill to the hotel rendered the excellent dinner","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2778",8681,"provided doubly attractive.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2779",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2780",8681,"Next morning he was early at work, and speedily began to realize how","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2781",8681,"many necessary articles he had forgotten at Paris. He hoped he would be","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2782",8681,"able to get them at Hyeres, but his remembrance of the limited","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2783",8681,"resources of the town made him somewhat doubtful. The small windows on","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2784",8681,"each side gave him scarcely enough light, but he did not open the door,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2785",8681,"fearing the curiosity of a chance passer-by. One cannot be too careful","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2786",8681,"in maturing a great invention.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2787",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2788",8681,"Plonville had been at work for possibly an hour and a half, when he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2789",8681,"heard someone singing, and that very sweetly. She sang with the joyous","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2790",8681,"freedom of one who suspected no listener. The song came nearer and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2791",8681,"nearer. Plonville standing amazed, dropped his implements, and stole to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2792",8681,"the somewhat obscure little window. He saw a vision of fresh loveliness","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2793",8681,"dressed in a costume he never before beheld on a vision. She came down","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2794",8681,"the bank with a light, springy step to the next cottage, took a key","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2795",8681,"that hung at her belt, and threw open the door. The song was hushed,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2796",8681,"but not silenced, for a moment, and then there came from out the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2797",8681,"cottage door the half of a boat that made Plonville gasp. Like the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2798",8681,"costume, he had never before seen such a boat. It was exactly the shape","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2799",8681,"in which he had designed his invention, and was of some extra light","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2800",8681,"material, for the sylph-like girl in the extraordinary dress pushed it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2801",8681,"forth without even ceasing her song. Next moment, she came out herself","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2802",8681,"and stood there while she adjusted her red head-gear. She drew the boat","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2803",8681,"down to the water, picked out of it a light, silver-mounted paddle,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2804",8681,"stepped deftly aboard, and settled down to her place with the airy","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2805",8681,"grace of a thistle-down. There was no seat in the boat, Plonville noted","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2806",8681,"with astonishment. The sea was very smooth, and a few strokes of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2807",8681,"paddle sent girl and craft out of sight along the coast. Plonville drew","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2808",8681,"a deep breath of bewilderment. It was his first sight of a Thames","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2809",8681,"boating costume and a canoe.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2810",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2811",8681,"This, then, was why the man winked when he gave him the key. Plonville","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2812",8681,"was in a quandary. Should he reveal himself when she returned? It did","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2813",8681,"not seem to be quite the thing to allow the girl to believe she had the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2814",8681,"coast to herself when in fact she hadn't. But then there was his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2815",8681,"invention to think of. He had sworn allegiance to that. He sat down and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2816",8681,"pondered. English, evidently. He had no idea English girls were so","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2817",8681,"pretty, and then that costume! It was _very_ taking. The rich,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2818",8681,"creamy folds of the white flannel, so simple, yet so complete, lingered","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2819",8681,"in his memory. Still, what was he there for? His invention certainly.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2820",8681,"The sneer of the lieutenant stung his memory. That Miss Whatever-her-","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2821",8681,"name-might-be had rented the next box was nothing to him; of course","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2822",8681,"not. He waved her aside and turned to his work. He had lost enough of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2823",8681,"time as it was; he would lose no more.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2824",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2825",8681,"Although armed with this heroic resolution, his task somehow did not","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2826",8681,"seem so interesting as before, and he found himself listening now and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2827",8681,"then for the siren's song. He dramatized imaginary situations, which is","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2828",8681,"always bad for practical work. He saw the frail craft shattered or","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2829",8681,"overturned, and beheld himself bravely buffeting the waves rescuing the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2830",8681,"fair girl in white. Then he remembered with a sigh that he was not a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2831",8681,"good swimmer. Possibly she was more at home in the waves than he was.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2832",8681,"Those English seemed on such terms of comradeship with the sea.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2833",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2834",8681,"At last, intuition rather than hearing told him she had returned. He","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2835",8681,"walked on tip-toe to the dingy window. She was pulling the light canoe","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2836",8681,"up from the water. He checked his impulse to offer assistance. When the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2837",8681,"girl sprang lightly up the bank, Plonville sighed and concluded he had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2838",8681,"done enough work for the day. As he reached the road, he noticed that","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2839",8681,"the white figure in the distance did not take the way to the hotel, but","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2840",8681,"towards one of the neighboring Chateaux.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2841",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2842",8681,"In the afternoon, Plonville worked long at his invention, and made","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2843",8681,"progress. He walked back to his hotel with the feeling of self-","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2844",8681,"satisfaction which indolent men have on those rare occasions when they","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2845",8681,"are industrious. He had been uninterrupted, and his resolutions were","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2846",8681,"again heroic. What had been done one afternoon might be done all","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2847",8681,"afternoons. He would think no more of the vision he had seen and he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2848",8681,"would work only after lunch, thus avoiding the necessity of revealing","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2849",8681,"himself, or of being a concealed watcher of her actions. Of course she","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2850",8681,"came always in the morning, for the English are a methodical people,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2851",8681,"and Plonville was so learned in their ways that he knew what they did","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2852",8681,"one day they were sure to do the next. An extraordinary nation,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2853",8681,"Plonville said to himself with a shrug of his shoulders, but then of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2854",8681,"course, we cannot all be French.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2855",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2856",8681,"It is rather a pity that temptation should step in just when a man has","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2857",8681,"made up his mind not to deviate from a certain straight line of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2858",8681,"conduct. There was to be a ball that night at the big hotel. Plonville","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2859",8681,"had refused to have anything to do with it. He had renounced the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2860",8681,"frivolities of life. He was there for rest, quiet, and study. He was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2861",8681,"adamant. That evening the invitation was again extended to him, the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2862",8681,"truth being that there was a scarcity of young men, as is usually the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2863",8681,"case at such functions. Plonville was about to re-state his objections","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2864",8681,"to frivolity when through the open door he caught a glimpse of two of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2865",8681,"the arriving guests ascending the stair. The girl had on a long opera","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2866",8681,"cloak with some fluffy white material round the neck and down the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2867",8681,"front. A filmy lace arrangement rested lightly on her fair hair. It was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2868",8681,"the lady of the canoe--glorified. Plonville wavered and was lost. He","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2869",8681,"rushed to his room and donned his war paint. Say what you like, evening","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2870",8681,"dress improves the appearance of a man. Besides this, he had resumed","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2871",8681,"the De once more, and his back was naturally straighter. De Plonville","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2872",8681,"looked well.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2873",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2874",8681,"They were speedily introduced, of course. De Plonville took care of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2875",8681,"that, and the manager of the ball was very grateful to him for coming,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2876",8681,"and for looking so nice. There was actually an air of distinction about","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2877",8681,"De Plonville. She was the Hon. Margaret Stansby, he learned. Besides","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2878",8681,"being unfair, it would be impossible to give their conversation. It","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2879",8681,"would read like a section from Ollendorf's French-English exercises. De","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2880",8681,"Plonville, as has been said, was very proud of his English, and,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2881",8681,"unfortunately, the Hon. Margaret had a sense of humor. He complimented","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2882",8681,"her by saying that she talked French even better than he talked","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2883",8681,"English, which, while doubtless true, was not the most tactful thing De","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2884",8681,"Plonville might have said. It was difficult to listen to such a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2885",8681,"statement given in his English, and refrain from laughing. Margaret,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2886",8681,"however, scored a great victory and did not laugh. The evening passed","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2887",8681,"pleasantly, she thought; delightfully, De Plonville thought.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2888",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2889",8681,"It was hard after this to come down to the prosaic work of completing a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2890",8681,"cloth canoe-tent, but, to De Plonville's credit, he persevered. He met","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2891",8681,"the young lady on several occasions, but never by the coast. The better","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2892",8681,"they became acquainted the more he wished to have the privilege of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2893",8681,"rescuing her from some deadly danger; but the opportunity did not come.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2894",8681,"It seldom does, except in books, as he bitterly remarked to himself.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2895",8681,"The sea was exasperatingly calm, and Miss Margaret was mistress of her","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2896",8681,"craft, as so many charming women are. He thought of buying a telescope","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2897",8681,"and watching her, for she had told him that one of her own delights was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2898",8681,"looking at the evolutions of the ironclads through a telescope on the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2899",8681,"terrace in front of the Chateau.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2900",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2901",8681,"At last, in spite of his distractions, De Plonville added the finishing","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2902",8681,"touches to his notable invention, and all that remained was to put it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2903",8681,"to a practical test. He chose a day when that portion of the French","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2904",8681,"navy which frequents the Rade d'Hyeres was not in sight, for he did not","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2905",8681,"wish to come within the field of the telescope at the Chateau terrace.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2906",8681,"He felt that he would not look his best as he paddled his new-fangled","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2907",8681,"boat. Besides, it might sink with him.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2908",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2909",8681,"There was not a sail in sight as he put forth. Even the fishing boats","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2910",8681,"of Carqueyranne were in shelter. The sea was very calm, and the sun","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2911",8681,"shone brightly. He had some little difficulty in getting seated, but he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2912",8681,"was elated to find that his invention answered all expectations. As he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2913",8681,"went further out he noticed a great buoy floating a long distance away.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2914",8681,"His evil genius suggested that it would be a good thing to paddle out","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2915",8681,"to the buoy and back. Many men can drink champagne and show no sign,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2916",8681,"but few can drink success and remain sober. The eccentric airs assumed","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2917",8681,"by noted authors prove the truth of this. De Plonville was drunk, and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2918",8681,"never suspected it. The tide, what little there is of it in the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2919",8681,"Mediterranean, helped him, and even the gentle breeze blew from the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2920",8681,"shore. He had some doubts as to the wisdom of his course before he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2921",8681,"reached the gigantic red buoy, but when he turned around and saw the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2922",8681,"appalling distance to the coast, he shuddered.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2923",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2924",8681,"The great buoy was of iron, apparently boiler plate, and there were","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2925",8681,"rings fastened to its side. It was pear-shaped with the point in the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2926",8681,"water, fastened to a chain that evidently led to an anchor. He wondered","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2927",8681,"what it was for. As he looked up it was moved by some unseen current,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2928",8681,"and rolled over as if bent on the destruction of his craft. Forgetting","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2929",8681,"himself, he sprang up to ward it off, and instantly one foot went","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2930",8681,"through the thin waterproof that formed the bottom and sides of his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2931",8681,"boat. He found himself struggling in the water almost before he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2932",8681,"realized what had happened. Kicking his foot free from the entanglement","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2933",8681,"that threatened to drag him under, he saw his invention slowly settle","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2934",8681,"down through the clear, green water. He grasped one of the rings of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2935",8681,"buoy, and hung there for a moment to catch his breath and consider his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2936",8681,"position. He rapidly came to the conclusion that it was not a pleasant","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2937",8681,"one, but further than that he found it difficult to go. Attempting to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2938",8681,"swim ashore would be simply one form of suicide. The thing to do was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2939",8681,"evidently to get on top of the buoy, but he realized that if he tried","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2940",8681,"to pull himself up by the rings it would simply roll him under. He was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2941",8681,"surprised to find, however, that such was not the case. He had under-","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2942",8681,"estimated both its size and its weight.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2943",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2944",8681,"He sat down on top of it and breathed heavily after his exertions,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2945",8681,"gazing for a few moments at the vast expanse of shimmering blue water.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2946",8681,"It was pretty, but discouraging. Not even a fishing-boat was in sight,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2947",8681,"and he was in a position where every prospect pleases, and only man is","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2948",8681,"in a vile situation. The big iron island had an uncomfortable habit","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2949",8681,"every now and then of lounging partly over to one side or the other, so","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2950",8681,"that De Plonville had to scramble this way or that to keep from falling","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2951",8681,"off. He vaguely surmised that his motions on these occasions lacked","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2952",8681,"dignity. The hot sun began to dry the clothes on his back, and he felt","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2953",8681,"his hair become crisp with salt. He recollected that swimming should be","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2954",8681,"easy here, for he was on the saltest portion of the saltest open sea in","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2955",8681,"the world. Then his gaze wandered over the flat lands about Les Salins","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2956",8681,"where acres of ground were covered artificially with Mediterranean","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2957",8681,"water so that the sun may evaporate it, and leave the coarse salt used","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2958",8681,"by the fishermen of the coast. He did not yet feel hungry, but he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2959",8681,"thought with regret of the good dinner which would be spread at the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2960",8681,"hotel that evening, when, perhaps, he would not be there.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2961",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2962",8681,"He turned himself around and scanned the distant Islands of Gold, but","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2963",8681,"there was as little prospect of help from that quarter as from the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2964",8681,"mainland. Becoming more accustomed to the swayings of the big globe, he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2965",8681,"stood up. What a fool he had been to come so far, and he used French","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2966",8681,"words between his teeth that sounded terse and emphatic. Still there","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2967",8681,"was little use thinking of that. Here he was, and here he would stay,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2968",8681,"as a President of his country had once remarked. The irksomeness and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2969",8681,"restraint of his position began to wear on his nerves, and he cried","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2970",8681,"aloud for something--anything--to happen rather than what he was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2971",8681,"enduring.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2972",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2973",8681,"Something happened.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2974",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2975",8681,"From between the Islands, there slowly appeared a great modern French","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2976",8681,"ship of war, small in the distance. Hope lighted up the face of De","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2977",8681,"Plonville. She must pass near enough to enable his signalling to be","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2978",8681,"seen by the lookout. Heavens! how leisurely she moved! Then a second","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2979",8681,"war vessel followed the first into view, and finally a third. The three","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2980",8681,"came slowly along in stately procession. De Plonville removed his coat","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2981",8681,"and waved it up and down to attract attention. So intent was he upon","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2982",8681,"this that he nearly lost his footing, and, realizing that the men-of-","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2983",8681,"war were still too far away, he desisted. He sat down as his excitement","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2984",8681,"abated, and watched their quiet approach. Once it seemed to him they","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2985",8681,"had stopped, and he leaned forward, shading his eyes with his hand, and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2986",8681,"watched them eagerly. They were just moving--that was all.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2987",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2988",8681,"Suddenly, from the black side of the foremost battle-ship, there rolled","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2989",8681,"upward a cloud of white smoke, obscuring the funnels and the rigging,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2990",8681,"thinning out into the blue sky over the top-masts. After what seemed a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2991",8681,"long interval the low, dull roar of a cannon reached him, followed by","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2992",8681,"the echo from the high hills of the island, and later by the fainter","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2993",8681,"re-echo from the mountains on the mainland. This depressed De","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2994",8681,"Plonville, for, if the ships were out for practice, the obscuring smoke","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2995",8681,"around them would make the seeing of his signalling very improbable;","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2996",8681,"and then that portion of the fleet might return the way it came,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2997",8681,"leaving him in his predicament. From the second ironclad arose a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2998",8681,"similar cloud, and this time far to his left there spurted up from the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"2999",8681,"sea a jet of water, waving in the air like a plume for a moment, then","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3000",8681,"dropping back in a shower on the ruffled surface.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3001",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3002",8681,"The buoy was a target!","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3003",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3004",8681,"As De Plonville realized its use, he felt that uncomfortable creeping","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3005",8681,"of the scalp which we call, the hair standing on end. The third cannon","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3006",8681,"sent up its cloud, and De Plonville's eyes extended at what they saw.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3007",8681,"Coming directly towards him was a cannon ball, skipping over the water","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3008",8681,"like a thrown pebble. His experience in the navy--at Paris--had never","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3009",8681,"taught him that such a thing was possible. He slid down flat on the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3010",8681,"buoy, till his chin rested on the iron, and awaited the shock. A","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3011",8681,"hundred yards from him the ball dipped into the water and disappeared.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3012",8681,"He found that he had ineffectually tried to drive his nails into the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3013",8681,"boiler plate, until his fingers' ends were sore. He stood up and waved","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3014",8681,"his arms, but the first vessel fired again, and the ball came shrieking","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3015",8681,"over him so low that he intuitively ducked his head. Like a pang of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3016",8681,"physical pain, the thought darted through his brain that he had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3017",8681,"instigated a censure on the bad firing of these very boats. Doubtless","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3018",8681,"they saw a man on the buoy, but as no man had any business there, the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3019",8681,"knocking of him off by a cannon ball would be good proof of accuracy of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3020",8681,"aim. The investigation which followed would be a feather in the cap of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3021",8681,"the officer in charge, whatever the verdict. De Plonville, with","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3022",8681,"something like a sigh, more than suspected that his untimely death","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3023",8681,"would not cast irretrievable gloom over the fleet.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3024",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3025",8681,"Well, a man has to die but once, and there is little use in making a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3026",8681,"fuss over the inevitable. He would meet his fate calmly and as a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3027",8681,"Frenchman should, with his face to the guns. There was a tinge of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3028",8681,"regret that there would be no one to witness his heroism. It is always","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3029",8681,"pleasant on such occasions to have a war correspondent, or at least a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3030",8681,"reporter, present. It is best to be as comfortable as possible under","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3031",8681,"any circumstances, so De Plonville sat down on the spheroid and let his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3032",8681,"feet dangle toward the water. The great buoy for some reason floated","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3033",8681,"around until it presented its side to the ships. None of the balls came","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3034",8681,"so near as those first fired--perhaps because of the accumulated smoke.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3035",8681,"New features of the situation continued to present themselves to De","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3036",8681,"Plonville as he sat there. The firing had been going on for some time","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3037",8681,"before he reflected that if a shot punctured the buoy it would fill and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3038",8681,"sink. Perhaps their orders were to fire until the buoy disappeared.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3039",8681,"There was little comfort in this suggestion.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3040",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3041",8681,"Firing had ceased for some minutes before he noticed the fact. A bank","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3042",8681,"of thinning smoke rested on the water between the buoy and the ships.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3043",8681,"He saw the ironclads move ponderously around and steam through this","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3044",8681,"bank turning broadside on again in one, two, three, order. He watched","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3045",8681,"the evolution with his chin resting on his hands, not realizing that","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3046",8681,"the moment for signalling had come. When the idea penetrated his","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3047",8681,"somewhat dazed mind, he sprang to his feet, but his opportunity had","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3048",8681,"gone. The smoke of the first gun rose in the air, there was a clang of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3049",8681,"iron on iron, and De Plonville found himself whirling in space: then","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3050",8681,"sinking in the sea. Coming breathless to the surface, he saw the buoy","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3051",8681,"revolving slowly, and a deep dinge in its side seemed to slide over its","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3052",8681,"top and disappear into the water, showing where the shot had struck.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3053",8681,"The second boat did not fire, and he knew that they were examining the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3054",8681,"buoy with their glasses. He swam around to the other side, intending to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3055",8681,"catch a ring and have it haul him up where he could be seen. Before he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3056",8681,"reached the place the buoy was at rest again, and as he laboriously","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3057",8681,"climbed on top more dead than alive, the second ship opened fire. He","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3058",8681,"lay down at full length exhausted, and hoped if they were going to hit","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3059",8681,"they would hit quick. Life was not worth having on these conditions. He","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3060",8681,"felt the hot sun on his back, and listened dreamily to the cannon. Hope","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3061",8681,"was gone, and he wondered at himself for feeling a remote rather than","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3062",8681,"an active interest in his fate. He thought of himself as somebody else,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3063",8681,"and felt a vague impersonal pity. He criticised the random firing, and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3064",8681,"suspected the hit was merely a fluke. When his back was dry he rolled","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3065",8681,"lazily over and lay gazing up at the cloudless sky. For greater comfort","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"3158",8681,"That morning, the Minister of War had received a letter which announced","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3159",8681,"to him that the writer of it had invented an explosive so terrible that","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3160",8681,"all known destructive agencies paled before it. As a Frenchman, he made","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3161",8681,"the first offer of his discovery to the French Government. It would","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3162",8681,"cost the Minister nothing, he said, to make a test which would","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3163",8681,"corroborate his amazing claims for the substance, and the moment that","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3164",8681,"test was made, any intelligent man would recognize the fact that the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3165",8681,"country which possessed the secret of this destructive compound would","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3166",8681,"at once occupy an unassailable position in a contentious world.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3167",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3168",8681,"The writer offered personally to convince the Minister of the truth of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3169",8681,"his assertions, provided they could go to some remote spot where the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3170",8681,"results of the explosion would do no damage, and where they would be","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3171",8681,"safe from espionage. The writer went on very frankly to say that if the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3172",8681,"Minister consulted with the agents of the police, they would at once","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3173",8681,"see in this invitation a trap for the probable assassination of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3174",8681,"Minister. But the inventor claimed that the Minister's own good sense","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3175",8681,"should show him that his death was desired by none. He was but newly","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3176",8681,"appointed, and had not yet had time to make enemies. France was at","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3177",8681,"peace with all the world, and this happened before the time of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3178",8681,"Anarchist demonstrations in Paris. It was but right, the letter went","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3179",8681,"on, that the Minister should have some guarantee as to the _bona","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3180",8681,"fides_ of the inventor. He therefore gave his name and address, and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3181",8681,"said if the Minister made inquiries from the police, he would find","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3182",8681,"nothing stood in their books against him. He was a student, whose","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3183",8681,"attention, for years, had been given to the subject of explosives. To","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3184",8681,"further show that he was entirely unselfish in this matter, he added","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3185",8681,"that he had no desire to enrich himself by his discovery. He had a","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3186",8681,"private income quite sufficient for his needs, and he intended to give,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3187",8681,"and not to sell, his secret to France. The only proviso he made was","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3188",8681,"that his name should be linked with this terrible compound, which he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3189",8681,"maintained would secure universal peace to the world, for, after its","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3190",8681,"qualities were known, no nation would dare to fight with another. The","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3191",8681,"sole ambition of the inventor, said the letter in conclusion, was to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3192",8681,"place his name high in the list of celebrated French scientists. If,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3193",8681,"however, the Minister refused to treat with him he would go to other","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3194",8681,"Governments until his invention was taken up, but the Government which","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3195",8681,"secured it would at once occupy the leading position among nations. He","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3196",8681,"entreated the Minister, therefore, for the sake of his country, to make","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3197",8681,"at least one test of the compound.","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3198",8681,"","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"3200",8681,"ministers were not so suspicious then as they are now. The Minister","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3201",8681,"made inquiries regarding the scientist, who lived in a little suburb of","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3202",8681,"Paris, and found that there was nothing against him on the books of the","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3203",8681,"police. Inquiry showed that all he had said about his own private","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"3204",8681,"fortune was true. The Minister therefore wrote to the inventor, and","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4107",8681,"may well understand. The reason that I have fixed the date for April","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4129",8681,"his money by robbing the dead. You didn't know that, did you? You","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4134",8681,"the room. Every stick of furniture is charged for, all the wall-paper,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4136",8681,"Dragon is not content with what is right. He knows he has finally lost","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4137",8681,"a customer, and so he makes all he can out of him. The furniture so","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4139",8681,"the Dragon doesn't abate a penny of his bill on that account. Now, I","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4140",8681,"have inquired of the furnishing man, on the street back of the hotel,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4141",8681,"and he has written on his card just the cost of mattress, sheets,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4142",8681,"pillows, and all that sort of thing, and the amount comes to about 50","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4144",8681,"of the furniture man. I have written a letter to the hotel-keeper,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4145",8681,"telling him just what the things will cost that he needs, and have","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4146",8681,"referred the Dragon to the card of the furniture man who has given me","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4147",8681,"the figures. This envelope I have addressed to the Dragon, and he will","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4167",8681,"the dead, for Robbins was a muscular young fellow who did not need to","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4168",8681,"live at the Riviera on account of his health, but merely because he","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4169",8681,"detested an English winter. Besides this, it may be added, although it","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4170",8681,"really is nobody's business, that a Nice Girl and her parents lived in","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4175",8681,"could not go. There was some big charity function on hand, and one","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4176",8681,"necessary part of the affair was the wheedling of money out of people's","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"4286",8681,"left the Metropolitan Hotel, which was his home. He was a young man,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
"4287",8681,"not more than thirty, and his face was a striking one. It was clean cut","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"5776",8681,"object lesson was to be taught. It would make them look like two fools,","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"

"5780",8681,"bitterly of these things his attention was diverted from the very","The Face and the Mask","Barr, Robert","Science Fiction","en"
