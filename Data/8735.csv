"233",8735,"fearful expectancy some have while swimming in the ocean, out of sight","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"255",8735,"against the trunk of a large, thickset tree for a moment of repose and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"261",8735,"a year or two later. The trees themselves were mighty pinions of","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"262",8735,"strength, tall and of great girth, and spread far apart from one","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"278",8735,"content with its pure waters, brought me to its destination: a large","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"297",8735,"morphed, in succession, from anxiety to despair, to anger, to","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"298",8735,"frustration, and in my frustration I knelt down and picked up a fallen","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"308",8735,"newly opened hole was then thrust out a head, hairy and with a short","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"309",8735,"snout-like edifice for a nose and mouth. Its eyes and the furry hair","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"310",8735,"which covered its face were brown, and a few wily whiskers protruded","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"358",8735,"distinct in the fingers, though but slightly, and their limbs were a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"360",8735,"differences, however, were the formation of their shoulders and chest,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"819",8735,"Let me continue, though, and I will explain what I mean and not confuse","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"820",8735,"you more. I landed with a thud on a pile of soft dirt some twenty feet","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"821",8735,"down, in a dark place which seemed open, not cavernous and cramped as I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"822",8735,"would have expected. My eyes adjusted to the darkness, and as they did,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"823",8735,"I realized it was not now totally lightless, for there was a faint glow","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"824",8735,"coming from somewhere in the distance. Looking up through the passage I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"825",8735,"had come down, I saw that there was no way to climb up it, and,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"826",8735,"accordingly, set off to find the source of the faint light that came","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"827",8735,"from the distance. After walking cautiously through the darkness, I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"828",8735,"reached a curve and then a tunnel-like exit to the spacious cavern that","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"829",8735,"I was in, and as I turned it I saw the source of the light: lava flows.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"830",8735,"The room, or area, I had entered was rather thin and round, with a river","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"831",8735,"of lava flowing downwards and a small ledge of rock winding along its","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"832",8735,"edge. Together they descended spirally downwards at a gentle angle,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"833",8735,"taking the form of an intelligently designed ramp. As I followed it down","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"834",8735,"I soon broke out in a sweat, for the gurgling, fiery plasma heated the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"835",8735,"area up to a warm degree.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"836",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"837",8735,"I found myself looking intently at the flowing fire beside which I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"838",8735,"walked, its strangeness stealing my meditations from other things, and I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"839",8735,"looked at it absorbingly, not paying attention to the path that I walked","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"840",8735,"on, so entranced was I with the feeling that its boiling character gave","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"845",8735,"monitoring my way, and when once my eyes glanced upward, I quickly saw","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"846",8735,"that my surroundings had changed. The narrow, spiral descending tunnel","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"847",8735,"had given way to a very cavernous area where the lava flow formed a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"848",8735,"large lake of fire. A domed ceiling crowned this great room, though not","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"849",8735,"exact and polished, having instead a rough appearance as it stretched","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"850",8735,"from wall to wall, a semi-chasm of a hundred yards, more or less, with","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"851",8735,"its uppermost height being not less than twenty yards. On the far walls","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"852",8735,"were two lava falls, trickling from raised tunnels in the wall into the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"853",8735,"body of lava, which covered the whole bottom of the room. There was a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"854",8735,"platform that sat in the middle of the fiery lake, connected to the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"855",8735,"tunnel I had come from by a walkway of stone. This room was different","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"856",8735,"than the other two, also, in its fashion, for while the previous had","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"857",8735,"vague evidences of intelligent design, this one was very obviously","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"858",8735,"artificially decorated. The walkway above mentioned was of ornate stone","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"859",8735,"with an intricate design of circles, squares, and triangles carved into","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"861",8735,"reached from floor to ceiling, each carved like a totem pole, with a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"862",8735,"variety of animals and shapes stacked upon one another. The dome was","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"863",8735,"done ornately as well, for I saw as I walked further into the room that","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"872",8735,"from an unseen figure somewhere on the center platform. It said, ""Jehu,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"876",8735,"confidently spoken, meticulously articulated. I looked around in its","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"877",8735,"direction and saw a short, elderly gnome with a long white beard","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"878",8735,"reaching to his chest and a short crop of hair on his oblong head, which","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"879",8735,"was outfitted with a sharp, angular nose, a pair of sparkling eyes, and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"880",8735,"two protruding ears. He was no more than four feet tall, and no less","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"881",8735,"than three, with a dignified poise to him, and was dressed in a dark","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"882",8735,"robe with a black and gold design on it. We looked at each other for a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"883",8735,"moment, he smiling pleasantly and me expressionless, for though I felt","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"884",8735,"that I should be surprised, or at least bewildered, at the sight of a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"885",8735,"gnome in an underground cavern, I was not, it was as if I had almost","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"886",8735,"been expecting it to happen, as if in the back of my mind I had already","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"887",8735,"been there and done that. Perhaps it was only a case of predestined deja","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"888",8735,"vu, or maybe it was something less tangible. Either way, the gnome then","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"895",8735,"not too much surprised, but rather complacent, thought I didn't look","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"896",8735,"bored or snobbish, as is sometimes the case in that situation. Instead I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"928",8735,"Sistine Chapel, its whole being a broad, harmonious picture that","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"930",8735,"was much more than a painting, though, because it stood out from the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"931",8735,"dome like a group of completely independent sculptures, but placed so as","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"932",8735,"to tell the combined story with a sort of native ease, not stressed or","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"940",8735,"sapphires, and pearls running along its breadth. It contained a dark red","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"941",8735,"liquid, which appeared to be boiling, and the man was holding it out to","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"942",8735,"a fierce lion whose shoulders were four feet across and whose mouth was","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"943",8735,"like a cavern, with stalactites and stalagmites of the most terrifying","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"948",8735,"a group of mighty lizards and beasts, the smallest of which was larger","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"2128",8735,"with a tough, leathery armor were making their way to and fro along the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"2142",8735,"no Zards were in sight save those on the walls, whose gaze was cast","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"2145",8735,"anionizers, so as to spread the destruction as evenly as possible.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2146",8735,"Wagner and myself were partners, and we took the central district, near","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2147",8735,"the government's center, the palace, and the Temple of Time, which rose","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2148",8735,"above the city like a great tree amidst a desert. It was, in fact, the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2149",8735,"very structure that had so stood out to me during my journey through the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2150",8735,"prairie upon my arrival, and once again its sobering sensation struck","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2151",8735,"me, and I found myself staring up at its top, a full 800 feet high, the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2152",8735,"bottom being an ornate and elaborate temple. The middle, which supplied","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2153",8735,"most of its height, was a long, round tower, and at top there was a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2154",8735,"spherical pinnacle which had what looked to be a room in it.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"2159",8735,"while all of Nunami would be leveled, the temple with its great tower","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2160",8735,"would be beyond the impact and left standing. Just as we had set it","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2161",8735,"correctly, we heard a high-pitched whistle, which was the preconcerted","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2162",8735,"signal among the raiders to use if any danger was nigh. We looked up","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2163",8735,"directly and saw its reason: a squadron of Zards had been garrisoned","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2164",8735,"inside the palace and had not left like the others, apparently because","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2165",8735,"its sole purpose was to protect their king, who did not leave the city,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2166",8735,"being preoccupied with business and not seeing the flames. When he did","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2167",8735,"go to the window, he saw the fire, and rushed to see what was about, but","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2168",8735,"instead of finding out, he ran into us, who were right outside the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"2172",8735,"dexterity, and did a wall-jump between two lofty buildings to gain the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2173",8735,"wall. The others had done likewise, having been trained by a lifetime of","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2174",8735,"conflict to have nerves of lightning speed and earthly strength. Their","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2175",8735,"instincts had come in subconsciously when they had seen the cause of the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2176",8735,"alarm and they escaped, without thinking of me in the critical moment. I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2177",8735,"lacked such strength and speed of mind and was caught as soon as I had","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2178",8735,"seen the squadron, aided, probably, by the fact that upon seeing me the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2179",8735,"king had become excited and rushed at me with great speed. When Wagner","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2180",8735,"had first turned around and saw me their prisoner, he looked crestfallen","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2181",8735,"and hopeless, for he had no way to rescue me. He held the remote control","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2182",8735,"for the atomic anionizers in his hand and was about to set them off and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2183",8735,"make good the plan, but before he could, our eyes met for an instant,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2184",8735,"and we connected beyond time and space, experiencing a strange","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2185",8735,"intra-personal deja vu. All was silent and still in that instant, and I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2186",8735,"saw him struggling inwardly: would he detonate the anionizers and make","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2187",8735,"good his long awaited plan, or would he retreat and leave the city","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2188",8735,"unharmed, for though I was wearing the electron reflecting suit, the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2189",8735,"collapse of all the high rise buildings would litter the ground with","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2190",8735,"debris from them, and all on the ground would be crushed. Would he spare","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2191",8735,"me from death, or his people? In that instant his face spoke more than","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2192",8735,"many others' do in their entire lifetime. It was cut through with a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2193",8735,"contrasting countenance, and yet inside of his eyes there was something","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2194",8735,"foreign to them shining through, something that I had never seen on his","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2195",8735,"fretless features before: evil intent. I could not tell if it was","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2196",8735,"natural to them and simply well hidden, or if it was an alien","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2197",8735,"expression, but it was fearfully expressed, and his eyes seemed to say,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2198",8735,"even at that great distance, that he took a third course, that he would","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2199",8735,"save me, but not for my sake, instead for his peoples'. And then it","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2200",8735,"passed, for he looked away, replaced the remote to his belt, and leapt","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2201",8735,"to the ground, where the other Canitaurs were awaiting him. I saw him no","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"2604",8735,"apparently watching those in the middle. A moment after I started","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2605",8735,"watching, the solitary Zard, the referee as I found out, walked to the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2606",8735,"edge, and each of the groups walked to one of the opposing sides and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2607",8735,"then turned about to face the other. The referee let out a loud yell and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2608",8735,"in a flash, the two teams ran at each other headlong, until converging","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2609",8735,"somewhere in the center of the field. As they met they dived upon one","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2610",8735,"another and pushed and shoved until the left team had isolated one of","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2611",8735,"the right's players, who was the only one on his team wearing an orange","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2612",8735,"jersey. They dived on him and jumped until the whole field was piled","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2613",8735,"high with them, and then they slowly began to disembark. Once all of the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2614",8735,"opposing team's players were off of the orange shirted Zard, all was","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2615",8735,"silent and still as the referee held his hand aloft and began counting","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2616",8735,"with his fingers. Everyone held their breathe and stood tensely by as","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2617",8735,"they watched. Just before the referee's tenth and final finger was","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2618",8735,"counted, the orange shirted player rose from the ground, amidst the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2619",8735,"screams of joy from his team and about half of the crowd, apparently","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2620",8735,"their fans. The two teams then returned to their respective sides, and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2621",8735,"again the referee yelled loudly, signaling them to rush at each other","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2622",8735,"once more, and more of the same ensued, this time it being the other","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2623",8735,"team's orange shirted player to get pounced on. Once again there was a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"2625",8735,"exposed, the referee began to count. Except that this time the orange","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2626",8735,"shirted one never got up. The other team cheered again and so did the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2627",8735,"other half of the crowd. The referee went to a pole on the sidelines and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2628",8735,"put up the number '1' on it while a few bystanders picked the Zard up","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2629",8735,"and carried him off the field. They continued to play in this fashion","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"2630",8735,"for awhile, going until one team or the other had no longer any players","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3374",8735,"I cut the carpet down its center, making two semi-circular pieces, each","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3375",8735,"with a moon shaped appearance, much like a wing. I based my idea in part","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3376",8735,"on the observation that the Canitaurs and Zards had apparently lost, or","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3377",8735,"disregarded, the springs of my time and instead used a hammock of","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3378",8735,"springy, elastic cords that spread across the face of the furniture.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3379",8735,"Simply put, they stretched elastic ropes across an empty frame, almost","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3380",8735,"like a trampoline made of individual cords. This created a very","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3381",8735,"comfortable springing feel, for they gave enough bounce to render the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3382",8735,"surface pliable, but not overly soft. Taking the bowie knife again, I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3383",8735,"thrust it into the couch, and cut away the cushioning to reveal the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3384",8735,"support. To my great relief, I found that it was constructed in a manner","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3385",8735,"similar to the other couches that I had seen. There were about two score","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3386",8735,"of the cords, each being between three and four feet long. These I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3387",8735,"unattached and laid them down in a pile.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3388",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3389",8735,"Next, I took the four main support beams for the couch, one running","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3390",8735,"along each side and two down the center in a crescent shape, with the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3391",8735,"same curve and slope as the carpet, as they were designed to contour the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3392",8735,"same wall. Then I disassembled the table and took from it two of its","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3393",8735,"main beams, which were about a foot shorter than their curved","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3394",8735,"counterparts. These I did not fully remove, instead loosening their","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3395",8735,"screws and swiveling them to extend outwards from the table at a right","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3397",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3398",8735,"Once that was accomplished, I went to the frame that had held the carpet","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3399",8735,"down and took the pins and fasteners which were used to secure it. These","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3400",8735,"I placed on the crescent beams from the couch, which used the same","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3401",8735,"standard size. Once I had secured the carpet sections to the beams, I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3402",8735,"attached the couch's beams, via the cords, to the long beams sticking","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3403",8735,"outward from the table, running the ends of all the cords through","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3404",8735,"another cord that could, upon being pulled, adjust their height by","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3405",8735,"pulling or releasing, thus controlling the distance between the upper","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3406",8735,"and the lower beams, and changing the amount of slack in the carpet that","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3407",8735,"was stretched between them. I then removed the legs from the tabletop,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3408",8735,"leaving just it and the beams together, the carpet being attached to the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3410",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3411",8735,"Thus my plan was completed, it being, in case you hadn't guessed, a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3412",8735,"primitive hang glider, the carpet being a sail and the beams the wings,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3413",8735,"the whole being steerable by either raising or lowering one side or the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3414",8735,"other, and the altitude being adjustable by raising or lowering the two","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3415",8735,"simultaneously. I felt keen joy at my skills in air travel at that","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3416",8735,"moment, and as I stepped back to admire my work, I felt that peculiar","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3417",8735,"satisfaction of having made something and finding that it was good.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3418",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3419",8735,"But that moment was short lived, for another problem quickly presented","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3420",8735,"itself, namely, how would I remove the hang-glider from the tower and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3421",8735,"launch it. It was far too large to go down the stairs and needed to be","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3422",8735,"propelled to a high speed or dropped from a high altitude to become","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3423",8735,"airborne. Since I had no way of propelling it, I needed to launch it","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3424",8735,"from the top of the tower, which provided plenty of altitude, but then","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3425",8735,"the problem of how to remove it from the tower arose. For a moment I was","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3426",8735,"stumped and almost admitted defeat, but then it came to me.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3427",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3428",8735,"The tower's only weakness was in its lack of protection against a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3429",8735,"deliberate rocking motion. If I was able to swing it back and forth fast","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3430",8735,"enough by slowly gaining speed and multiplying the momentum, it would be","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3431",8735,"possible to get it to lean far enough that the dome would snap off,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3432",8735,"leaving the room open to the air. This was possible, though rather","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3433",8735,"unlikely. But I tried anyway.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3434",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3435",8735,"Starting on one side I began to move from one edge to the other until a","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3436",8735,"faint rocking motion could be felt. Then I increased my speed in","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3437",8735,"proportion to the speed of the tower itself. It was a slow start, but","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3438",8735,"the momentum began to grow, and as it did each successive sway became","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3439",8735,"faster and faster. Soon it was going so fast that I began to have","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3440",8735,"unstable footing, the whole tower creaking like a tree that it is blown","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3441",8735,"by a heavy wind. The speed kept increasing until it reached its fastest,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3442",8735,"swooshing to and fro with all of its accumulated force.","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3443",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3444",8735,"It was then that the break happened, for on one of the thrusts the top","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3446",8735,"soon as it was off I shoved the hang-glider with all the force I could","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3447",8735,"muster towards the edge. At first it fell, but a few feet from the edge","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3448",8735,"its wings caught the wind and it was brought up to a stable soar, and","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3449",8735,"just at that instant I landed on it, for I had jumped right after it. I","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3450",8735,"hit with a thud and felt the craft bounce downwards a little as I hit,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3451",8735,"but it soon regained its stability and sped on through the air as behind","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3453",8735,"","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3454",8735,"I pulled the left wing down and the glider began to turn in that","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3455",8735,"direction. Since I had launched into the opposite direction of the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3459",8735,"influence of its soft textures the city of Nunami looked as it had","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3460",8735,"before: quaint, picturesque, and inviting. But there was a great","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3461",8735,"difference now, for the tower itself had completely collapsed under the","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3462",8735,"momentum, and its ruins had fallen down upon the Temple of Time,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3463",8735,"demolishing it and leaving only ruins. It had also fallen on a strip of","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3464",8735,"the city, taking with it several buildings and leaving only rubble. The","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3465",8735,"King, Wagner, and Bernibus could just barely be seen amongst the crowds","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3473",8735,"any significant foliage, it still held something equally dear to me as","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3474",8735,"landscape: safety. The wind currents were strong and my speed was about","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3844",8735,"ourselves in a small, battered city. There were no great buildings or","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3853",8735,"lands from harassing the inhabitants as they worked and played in their","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3859",8735,"downwards, bringing them almost unlimited supplies of fresh water. Using","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3860",8735,"these two major systems, they were able to live in a comfortable manner,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
"3861",8735,"not comfortable in a sense of comparison with the Zards or Canitaurs,","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"

"3864",8735,"for happiness is not found in the accumulation of excess comforts, but","The Revolutions of Time","Dunn, Jonathan","Science Fiction","en"
