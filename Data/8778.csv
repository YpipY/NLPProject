"668",8778,"them, and saw how there were oak-leaves done into them, and flowers, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"669",8778,"coneys, and squirrels, she but smiled somewhat grimly on Birdalone, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"670",8778,"said: Well, belike thou art a fool to waste thy time and mine in such","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"671",8778,"toys; and to give thee thy due would be to give thee stripes.  But thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"672",8778,"doest herein after the nature of earthly women, to adorn thy body,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"673",8778,"whatsoever else is toward.  And well is that, since I would have thee a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"674",8778,"woman so soon as may be; and I will help thy mind for finery, since thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"675",8778,"art so deft with thy needle.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"676",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"677",8778,"Therewith she went to the big coffer and drew forth thence a piece of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"678",8778,"fine green cloth, and another of fine linen, and said to Birdalone: This","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"679",8778,"mayest thou take, and make thee a gown thereof and a new smock, and make","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"680",8778,"them if thou wilt as gay as thy new shoon are gotten to be; and here is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"681",8778,"wherewithal.  And therewith she gave her two handfuls of silken threads","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"682",8778,"and gold, and said: Now I suppose that I must do the more part of thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"683",8778,"work, while thou art making thee these gaudy garments.  But maybe someone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"684",8778,"may be coming this way ere long, who will deem the bird the finer for her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"685",8778,"fine feathers.  Now depart from me; for I would both work for thee and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"687",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"688",8778,"Who was glad now but Birdalone; she grew red with new pleasure, and knelt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"689",8778,"down and kissed the witch’s hand, and then went her ways to the wood with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"690",8778,"her precious lading, and wrought there under her oak-tree day after day,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"691",8778,"and all days, either there, or in the house when the weather was foul.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"692",8778,"That was in the middle of March, when all birds were singing, and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"693",8778,"young leaves showing on the hawthorns, so that there were pale green","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"696",8778,"opening its blossom; and March wore and April, and still she was at work","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"697",8778,"happily when now it was later May, and the hare-bells were in full bloom","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"700",8778,"All this while the witch had meddled little with Birdalone, and had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"701",8778,"bidden her to no work afield or in the stead which was anywise grievous,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"702",8778,"but had done all herself; yet was she few-spoken with her, and would oft","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"703",8778,"behold her gloomily.  And one evening when Birdalone came in from the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"704",8778,"wood, the witch came close up to her and stared her in the face, and said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"705",8778,"suddenly: Is it in thine heart to flee away from me and leave me?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"707",8778,"A sharp pang of fear shot through Birdalone’s heart at that word, and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"708",8778,"turned very red, and then pale to the lips, but stammered out: No, lady,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"709",8778,"it is not in mine heart.  The dame looked grimly on her and said: If thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"710",8778,"try it and fail, thou shalt rue it once only, to wit, lifelong; and thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"711",8778,"canst but fail.  She was silent a while, and then spake in a milder","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"712",8778,"voice: Be content here a while with me, and thereafter thou shalt be more","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"713",8778,"content, and that before long.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"714",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"715",8778,"She said no more at that time; but her word clave to Birdalone’s heart,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"716",8778,"and for some time thereafter she was sorely oppressed with a burden of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"717",8778,"fear, and knew not how to hold herself before the witch-wife.  But the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"718",8778,"days wore, and nought betid, and the maiden’s heart grew lighter, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"719",8778,"still she wrought on at her gown and her smock, and it was well-nigh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"720",8778,"done.  She had broidered the said gown with roses and lilies, and a tall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"735",8778,"fearless, so that they would come to her hand and sport with her when she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"846",8778,"what thou hast said about the fashion of any part of me, that same,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"847",8778,"setting aside thy lovely words, which make the tears come into the eyes","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"848",8778,"of me, would I say of thee.  Look thou!  I take thine hair and lay the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"849",8778,"tress amongst mine, and thou mayst not tell which is which; and amidst","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"850",8778,"the soft waves of it thy forehead is nestling smooth as thou saidst of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"851",8778,"mine: hawk-grey and wide apart are thine eyen, and deep thought and all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"852",8778,"tenderness is in them, as of me thou sayest: fine is thy nose and of due","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"853",8778,"measure; and thy cheeks a little hollow, and somewhat thin thy lovely","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"854",8778,"lips; and thy round chin so goodly carven, as it might not be better","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"855",8778,"done.  And of thy body else I will say as thou sayst of mine, though I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"856",8778,"deem these hands have done more work than thine.  But see thou! thy leg","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"857",8778,"and mine as they stand together; and thine arm, as if it were of my body.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"858",8778,"Slim and slender thou art, or it may be lank; and I deem our dame would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"859",8778,"call thee also bag-of-bones.  Now is this strange.  Who art thou?  Art","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"861",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"862",8778,"Spake then to Birdalone that image of her, and said, smiling kindly on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"863",8778,"her: As to our likeness, thou hast it now; so alike are we, as if we were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"864",8778,"cast in one mould.  But thy sister of blood I am not; nay, I will tell","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"865",8778,"thee at once that I am not of the children of Adam.  As to what I am,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"866",8778,"that is a long story, and I may not tell it as now; but thou mayst call","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"867",8778,"me Habundia, as I call thee Birdalone.  Now it is true that to everyone I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"868",8778,"show not myself in this fair shape of thee; but be not aghast thereat, or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"869",8778,"deem me like unto thy mistress herein, for as now I am, so ever shall I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"871",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"872",8778,"Quoth Birdalone, looking on her anxiously: Yea, and I shall see thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"873",8778,"again, shall I not? else should I grieve, and wish that I had never seen","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"874",8778,"thee at all.  Yea, forsooth, said Habundia, for I myself were most fain","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"875",8778,"to see thee oft.  But now must thou presently get thee back home, for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"876",8778,"evil as now is the mood of thy mistress, and she is rueing the gift of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"877",8778,"the green gown, and hath in her mind to seek occasion to chastise thee.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"878",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"879",8778,"Now was Birdalone half weeping, as she did on her raiment while her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"880",8778,"friend looked on her kindly.  She said presently: Habundia, thou seest I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"881",8778,"am hard bestead; give me some good rede thereto.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"882",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"883",8778,"That will I, said the wood-wife.  When thou goest home to the house, be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"884",8778,"glad of countenance, and joyous that thy gown is nigh done; and therewith","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"885",8778,"be exceeding wary.  For I deem it most like that she will ask thee what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"886",8778,"thou hast seen in the wood, and then if thou falter, or thy face change,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"887",8778,"then she will have an inkling of what hath befallen, to wit, that thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"888",8778,"hast seen someone; and then will she be minded to question thy skin.  But","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"889",8778,"if thou keep countenance valiantly, then presently will her doubt run off","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"890",8778,"her, and she will cease grudging, and will grow mild with thee and meddle","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"891",8778,"not.  This is the first rede, and is for to-day; and now for the second,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"892",8778,"which is for days yet unborn.  Thou hast in thy mind to flee away from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"893",8778,"her; and even so shalt thou do one day, though it may be by way of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"894",8778,"Weeping Cross; for she is sly and wise and grim, though sooth it is that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"895",8778,"she hateth thee not utterly.  Now thou must note that nowise she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"896",8778,"hindereth thee from faring in this wood, and that is because she wotteth,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"898",8778,"thou to it that it is by the way of the water that thou shalt fare to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"899",8778,"land of men-folk.  Belike this may seem marvellous to thee; but so it is;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"900",8778,"and belike I may tell thee more hereof when time serveth.  Now cometh the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"901",8778,"last word of my rede.  Maybe if thou come often to the wood, we shall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"903",8778,"wouldst see me at once, come hither, and make fire, and burn a hair of my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"904",8778,"head therein, and I will be with thee: here is for thee a tress of mine","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"905",8778,"hair; now thou art clad, thou mayst take a knife from thy pouch and shear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"920",8778,"grimly a while, and then she said: What ails thee, my servant, that thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"924",8778,"soon now I shall feel these dainty things beating about my ankles.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"925",8778,"she held up and spread abroad the skirt with her two hands, and it was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"927",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"938",8778,"arises in the morning.  But the witch stood so scowling on her, and with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"939",8778,"so sour a look, that Birdalone, glancing at her, found her heart sink so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"952",8778,"for her to do, over-wrought as she was betwixt hope and fear: yea, I saw","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"960",8778,"changed countenance that other day, when she had charged her with being","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"961",8778,"minded to flee; and now she saw her with wondering face, and in no wise","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"962",8778,"confused or afraid of guilt, as it seemed; so she believed her tale, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"963",8778,"being the more at ease thereby, her wrath ran off her, and she spake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"964",8778,"altogether pleasantly to Birdalone, and said: Now I have had my gird at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"965",8778,"thee, my servant, I must tell thee that in sooth it is not all for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"966",8778,"nothing that thou hast had these months of rest; for verily thou hast","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"967",8778,"grown more of a woman thereby, and hast sleekened and rounded much.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"968",8778,"Albeit, the haysel will wait no longer for us, and the day after","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"969",8778,"to-morrow we must fall to on it.  But when that is done, thou shalt be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"970",8778,"free to do thy green gown, or what thou wilt, till wheat harvest is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1028",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1029",8778,"And still she swam on: and now a light wind had been drawn up from the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1030",8778,"west, and was driving a little ripple athwart the lake, and she swam the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1031",8778,"swiftlier for it awhile, but then turned over on her back and floated","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1032",8778,"southward still.  Till on a sudden, as she lay looking up toward the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1033",8778,"far-away blue sky, and she so little and low on the face of the waters,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1034",8778,"and the lake so deep beneath her, and the wind coming ever fresher from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1035",8778,"the west, and the ripple rising higher against her, a terror fell upon","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1118",8778,"heard thereof, or been set to toil therewith.  She noted that it was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1119",8778,"mostly pale grey of hue, as if it had been bleached by sun and water, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1120",8778,"at the stem and stern were smears of darker colour, as though someone had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1122",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1125",8778,"to see whatever might be seen, she deemed it would go ill with her did","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1126",8778,"the witch happen on her there; wherefore she turned about, and went back","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1127",8778,"the way she had come, going very slowly and pondering the tidings.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1128",8778,"ever she called to mind what Habundia had said to her, that it was by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1130",8778,"might escape therein; so different as her going would be thereby to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1131",8778,"swimming the lake with her wet body.  Then again she thought, that before","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1132",8778,"she might let herself hope this, it were best, if she might, to find out","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1133",8778,"from the witch what was the thing, and if she knew thereof.  Yet at last","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1134",8778,"she called to mind how little patient of questions was her mistress, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1135",8778,"that if she were unheedful she might come to raise an evil storm about","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1137",8778,"hidden in her own breast till she should see Habundia again; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1209",8778,"spake once more, still in the same soft and wheedling voice: Yet, my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1210",8778,"servant, thy guilt would be required of me, if I let this pass as if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1211",8778,"to-day were the same as yesterday; yea, and of thee also would it be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1212",8778,"required; therefore it is a part of the pardon that thou be corrected:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1213",8778,"and the correction must be terrible to thee, that thou mayst remember","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1214",8778,"never again to thrust thyself into the jaws of death.  And what may I do","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1215",8778,"to correct thee?  It shall be in a strange way, such as thou hast never","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1216",8778,"dreamed of.  Yet the anguish thereof shall go to thine heart’s root; but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1217",8778,"this must thou needs bear, for my good and thine, so that both we may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1218",8778,"live and be merry hereafter.  Go now, fill this cup with water from the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1219",8778,"spring and come back with it.  Birdalone took the cup with a sinking","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1220",8778,"heart, and filled it, and brought it back, and stood before the witch","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1223",8778,"Then the witch-wife took up the flasket and pulled out the stopple and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1224",8778,"betook it to Birdalone, and said: Drink of this now, a little sip, no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1225",8778,"more.  And the maiden did so, and the liquor was no sooner down her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1226",8778,"gullet than the witch-wife and the chamber, and all things about her,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1227",8778,"became somewhat dim to her; but yet not so much so as that she could not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1228",8778,"see them.  But when she stretched out her arm she could see it not at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1229",8778,"all, nor her limbs nor any other part of her which her eyes might fall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1230",8778,"upon.  Then would she have uttered a lamentable wail, but the voice was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1231",8778,"sealed up in her and no sound came from her voice.  Then she heard the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1232",8778,"witch-wife how she said (and yet she heard it as if her voice came from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1233",8778,"afar), Nay, thou canst not speak, and thou canst not see thyself, nor may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1234",8778,"any other, save me, and I but dimly.  But this is but part of what I must","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1235",8778,"lay upon thee; for next I must give thee a new shape, and that both","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1236",8778,"thyself and all other may see.  But, before I do that, I must speak a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1237",8778,"word to thee, which thy new shape would not suffer the sense thereof to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1319",8778,"bright morning, as if all this had been but a dream.  But the witch-wife","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1320",8778,"was standing over her and crying out: Thou art late, slug-a-bed, this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1321",8778,"fair-weather day, and the grass all spoiling for lack of the scythe.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1322",8778,"Off! and down to the meadow with thee.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1324",8778,"Birdalone waited not for more words, but sprang out of bed, and had her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1325",8778,"work-a-day raiment on in a twinkling, and stayed but to wash her in a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1326",8778,"pool of the brook, and then was amidst the tall grass with the swathe","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1327",8778,"falling before her.  As she worked she thought, and could scarce tell","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1328",8778,"whether joy at her present deliverance, or terror of the witch-wife, were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1329",8778,"the greatest.  Sore was her longing to go see her friend in the wood, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1330",8778,"the haysel lasted more than a week, and when that was done, whether it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1331",8778,"were of set purpose or no, the dame forgat her other promise, to give","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1332",8778,"Birdalone more holiday, and kept her close to her work about meadow and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1333",8778,"acre.  Otherwise her mistress nowise mishandled or threatened her, though","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1334",8778,"she had gone back to the surliness and railing which was her wont.  At","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1335",8778,"last, on a morning when the dame had bidden her to nought of work,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1336",8778,"Birdalone took her bow in her hand and cast her quiver on her back, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1337",8778,"went her ways into the wood, and forgat not the tress of Habundia’s hair;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1338",8778,"but she had no need to use it, for when she was come to the Oak of Tryst,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1342",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1343",8778,"So they kissed and embraced, and Birdalone wept upon her friend’s bosom,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1347",8778,"tale is partly told without words, and I would weep for thee if I might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1348",8778,"shed tears.  But thou mayest tell me wherefore thou didst suffer this;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1349",8778,"though forsooth I have an inkling thereof.  Hast thou happened on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1350",8778,"witch’s ferry?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1351",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1352",8778,"Even so it was, sister, quoth Birdalone.  And therewith she plucked up","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1353",8778,"heart, and told her all the tale of the vanishing of her body and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1354",8778,"skin-changing.  And Habundia answered: Well then, there is this to be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1355",8778,"said, that sooner or later this must have happened, for thereby lieth thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1356",8778,"road of escape; wherefore it is better sooner than later.  But tell me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1357",8778,"again: was she fierce and rough in words with thee? for what she said to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1358",8778,"thee thou hast not yet told me.  Said Birdalone: In her first fury, when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1359",8778,"she was like to have slain me, she had no words, nought but wolfish","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1360",8778,"cries.  But thereafter she spake unto me strangely, yet neither fiercely","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1361",8778,"nor roughly; nay, it seemed to me as if almost she loved me.  And more","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1362",8778,"than almost she besought me rather than commanded me not to flee from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1363",8778,"her.  And wert thou beguiled by her soft speech? said Habundia.  Nowise","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1364",8778,"to cast aside my hope of escape, nay, not even in that hour, said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1365",8778,"Birdalone; but amidst all the confusion and terror somewhat was I moved","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1366",8778,"to compassion on her.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1367",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1368",8778,"Spake Habundia, looking anxiously on her: Dost thou deem that thou art","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1369",8778,"somewhat cowed by what she hath done to thee?  Said Birdalone, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1370",8778,"flushed very red: Oh no, no!  Nought save death or bonds shall come","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1371",8778,"betwixt me and my utmost striving for escape.  That is better than well,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1372",8778,"said Habundia; but again, canst thou have patience a little, and be wary","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1373",8778,"and wise the while?  So meseemeth, said the maiden.  Said Habundia: Again","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1374",8778,"it is well.  Now is the summer beginning to wane, and by my rede thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1375",8778,"shalt not try the flight until May is come again and well-nigh worn into","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1376",8778,"June; for thou wilt be bigger then, little sister, and tidings are waxing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1377",8778,"that shall get matters ready for thy departure: moreover, thou must yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1378",8778,"learn what thou hast to do meanwhile, and thereof shall I tell thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1379",8778,"somewhat as now.  For that boat, the thing which thou didst find, and for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1380",8778,"which thou didst suffer, is called the Sending Boat, and therein thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1381",8778,"mistress fareth time and again, I deem to seek to some other of her kind,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1382",8778,"but I know not unto whom, or whereto.  Hast thou noted of her that whiles","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1384",8778,"and this is one of the things which heretofore hath made me most afraid.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1385",8778,"Said Habundia: Well now, that she wendeth somewhither in this ferry I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1387",8778,"Sending Boat to make it obey her; whereas, though I know all things of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1388",8778,"the wood, I know but little of the lake.  Wherefore, though there be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1389",8778,"peril to thee therein, follow her twice or thrice when she riseth up for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1390",8778,"this faring, and note closely what is her manner of dealing with the said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1392",8778,"smart and the skin-changing, or even if it were the stroke of the knife,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1393",8778,"to gather this wisdom?  And thereafter thou shalt come hither and tell me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1394",8778,"how thou hast sped.  With a good heart will I, dear sister, said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1398",8778,"valiant, but herein may I help thee somewhat; here is a gold finger-ring,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1400",8778,"thou goest on this quest, set thou this same ring on the middle finger of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1408",8778,"And nought then shall be seen of thee even by one who standeth close","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1410",8778,"witch have sight thereof ever, or she will know that thou hast met me.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1412",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1413",8778,"Laughed Birdalone, and took the ring and set it on her finger, and spake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1414",8778,"aloud even as Habundia had given her the words.  Then quoth Habundia,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1415",8778,"laughing: Now have I lost my friend and sister, for thou art gone,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1416",8778,"Birdalone.  Take off the ring, sweetling, and get thee to thine hunting,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1417",8778,"for if thou come home empty-handed there will be flyting awaiting thee,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1419",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1420",8778,"So Birdalone took off the ring and came back to sight again laughing;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1421",8778,"then the wood-woman kissed her and turned her heels to her, and was gone;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1422",8778,"but Birdalone strung her bow, and got to her woodcraft, and presently had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1423",8778,"a brace of hares, wherewith she went back home to the dame; who indeed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1439",8778,"gallantly, or with my legs alone, if I stir mine arms ever so little.  I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1440",8778,"will go straightway if thou wilt, lady; but give me a length of twine so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1441",8778,"that I may tie my catch about my middle when I swim back again.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1442",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1443",8778,"Therewith she went forth lightly to fetch her angle, which was in a shed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1451",8778,"No sooner had she done it, but she was glad; for she heard the dame","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1452",8778,"calling her, who, when she came to the house-door, spake and said: Now","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1454",8778,"they be fouled by some straying beast.  And therewith she looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1455",8778,"curiously on Birdalone, and knit her brows when she saw that the maiden","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1456",8778,"changed countenance in nowise.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1457",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1458",8778,"Down to the water went they, and the witch sat down close to where","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1459",8778,"Birdalone should take the water, and watched her do off her raiment, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1461",8778,"head as she stood knee-deep, and said: How long shall I abide, lady, if I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1464",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1465",8778,"Fell Birdalone to swimming then, and when she was more than half over,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1466",8778,"the witch, stirring no more than need was, got hold of her raiment, which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1467",8778,"was but the old grey coat over a smock, and ransacked it, but found","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1468",8778,"nought, as well ye may wot.  And when she had done, she sat down again in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1469",8778,"heavy mood as it seemed, and watched Birdalone swimming, and when she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1470",8778,"beheld her body come forth out of the water, and pass out of sight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1471",8778,"amongst the flowers of the eyot, she arose and went her ways home.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1472",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1473",8778,"Birdalone looked through the willow-boughs, and saw her turn away; then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1474",8778,"she fared to her fishing with a smile, and soon had plenteous catch from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1475",8778,"under the willow-boughs.  Then, whereas the day was very calm and fair,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1476",8778,"and the dame had given her holiday, she wandered about the eyot, and most","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1477",8778,"in a little wood of berry-trees, as quicken and whitebeam and dog-wood,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1478",8778,"and sported with the birds, who feared her not, but came and sat on her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1479",8778,"shoulders, and crept about her feet.  She went also and stood a while on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1480",8778,"the southern shore, and looked on the wide water dim in the offing under","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1481",8778,"the hot-weather haze, and longed to be gone beyond it.  Then she turned","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1482",8778,"away, and to the other shore, and gat her fish and strung them on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1483",8778,"string, and made them fast to her middle, and so took the water back","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1484",8778,"again to the yellow strand, where now was no one awaiting her.  But","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1485",8778,"before she did on her garments, she looked on them, and saw that they lay","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1486",8778,"not as she had left them, whereby she knew well that the witch-wife had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1489",8778,"Amidst all this the day was wearing to an end, and again she saw the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1490",8778,"smoke of the cooking-fire going up into the air from the chimney of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1492",8778,"occasion for ransacking her raiment.  But she plucked up heart, and came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1518",8778,"but barely saved her skin from the twig-shower.  Then yet again she went","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1535",8778,"arose very quietly and did on her smock, which lay ever under her pillow","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1536",8778,"with the ring sewn thereto again, and so went out adoors also, and deemed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1537",8778,"she saw the witch some way on ahead; but it was nothing for her light","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1539",8778,"set it on her finger; then in a low voice she said:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1553",8778,"she was stayed by the creek, and presently drew somewhat from under her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1554",8778,"cloak, and the maiden saw that she was about striking flint upon steel,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1555",8778,"and quaked somewhat, lest her charm had played her false.  Presently the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1561",8778,"Now the witch, holding the lantern aloft, steps over the gunwale of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1568",8778,"stood up, and went to the bows of the craft and hung over them, and drew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1569",8778,"her arm to and fro over the stem to bloody it; and went thereafter to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1570",8778,"stern, and took blood into her right hand and passed it over the place of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1571",8778,"the steerage (for there was no rudder) and came back and sat down on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1572",8778,"thwart again; and, so far as Birdalone might see, busied herself in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1573",8778,"staunching the little wound on her arm.  Then deemed Birdalone that she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1574",8778,"knew what manner of paint was that which had made the rusty smears which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1578",8778,"throat, and then words came out of her, and she sang in a crow’s croak:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1579",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1580",8778,"   The red raven-wine now","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1581",8778,"   Hast thou drunk, stern and bow;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1582",8778,"   Then wake and awake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1583",8778,"   And the wonted way take!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1584",8778,"   The way of the Wender forth over the flood,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1589",8778,"it was but a minute ere Birdalone lost all sight of it.  She abode a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1590",8778,"little longer, lest perchance boat and witch might come back on her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1592",8778,"off her ring straightway, but the thought came on her, that she had seen","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1593",8778,"the witch depart in her second semblance; how if she were abiding her at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1594",8778,"home in her wonted skin?  So she came to the house even as she was, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1595",8778,"opened the door, and looked in, quaking; but there was no image of a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1596",8778,"child of Adam therein, and no living thing, save the cat drowsing before","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1597",8778,"the fire; wherefore Birdalone took the ring from her finger and went to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1598",8778,"the hearth, and stirred up the cat with her foot till he arose and fell","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1600",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1601",8778,"Thereafter she made her ring fast to her smock again, and set the smock","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1620",8778,"little in her unwonted soft mood; which yet lasted so long that on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1626",8778,"Here, then, thou hast learned how to sail the lake.  But hast thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1627",8778,"learned enough to try the adventure and not to fail?  Even so I deem,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1628",8778,"said Birdalone; but this I would say, that meseemeth it better that I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1629",8778,"follow the witch down to the boat one more time at least; for this first","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1631",8778,"hear it said oftener, lest it be not ever the same words?  What sayest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1632",8778,"thou?  She said: Thou art right herein, and, since the adventure may not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1633",8778,"be tried till next June is at hand, there is time enough and to spare.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1634",8778,"And now for this hour that is we need talk no more of it.  Only, my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1635",8778,"sweet, I beseech thee be wary; and above all suffer not the witch-wife to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1636",8778,"set eye or hand on the ring.  Truly mine heart oft aches sorely for thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1637",8778,"peril; for therein the image of thee abideth rather as of my daughter","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1638",8778,"than my friend.  Yea, now thou laughest, but kindly, so that the sound of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1644",8778,"Yea, yea, said Birdalone, with all my heart.  Then she hung her head a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1645",8778,"while and kept silence, and thereafter looked up and spake: I would ask","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1646",8778,"thee a thing and crave somewhat of thee, as if thou wert verily my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1647",8778,"mother; wilt thou grant it me?  Yea, surely, child, said Habundia.  Said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1648",8778,"Birdalone: This it is then, that thou wilt learn me of thy wisdom.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1649",8778,"Habundia smiled full kindly on her, and said: This of all things I would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1654",8778,"So the maiden sat down by her likeness under the oak, and began to learn","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1655",8778,"her lesson.  Forsooth forgotten is the wisdom, though the tale of its","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1658",8778,"When it was done, Birdalone kissed her wood-mother and said: This is now","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1659",8778,"the best day of my life, this and the day when first I saw thee.  I will","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1660",8778,"come hither now many times before the day of my departure.  Yea, but,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1661",8778,"sweet child, said Habundia, beware of the witch and her cruelty; I fear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1662",8778,"me she shall yet be grim toward thee.  So will I be wary, said Birdalone,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1663",8778,"but I will venture some little peril of pain but if thou forbid me,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1665",8778,"thee the more, because after one of these grim times then mostly doth she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1666",8778,"meddle the less with me for a while, wherefore I shall be the freer to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1667",8778,"come hither.  Habundia kissed her and embraced her, and said: Valiant art","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1668",8778,"thou for a young maiden, my child, and I would not refrain thee more than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1677",8778,"stripped, lean enough I should see thee, doubtless.  But now look to it,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1687",8778,"the witch went a-night-tide to the Sending Boat, and Birdalone followed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1688",8778,"her as erst.  This time the night was wild and windy, but the moon was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1689",8778,"high aloft and big, and all cloud save a few flecks was blown from off","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1694",8778,"Another time, when November was well-nigh out, the dame arose for her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1695",8778,"lake-faring; but this night the snow lay deep betwixt house and water,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1696",8778,"and Birdalone thought that it would scarce do to follow.  Forsooth she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1697",8778,"knew not whether her feet would the less leave their print in the snow","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1702",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1703",8778,"It must be told, that in this while Birdalone went oft to the Trysting","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1709",8778,"with the wood-mother nought she told her thereof, but was blithe and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1710",8778,"merry beyond her wont.  She came back home thereafter empty handed, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1711",8778,"stepped into the chamber proudly and with bright eyes and flushed cheeks,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1712",8778,"though she looked for nought save chastisement; yea, it might be even the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1713",8778,"skin-changing.  Forsooth the witch was sitting crouched in her chair with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1714",8778,"her hands on the elbows and her head thrust forward, like a wild beast at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1716",8778,"drew back into herself again, and muttered somewhat unheard; but to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1717",8778,"Birdalone spake nought of good or bad.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1718",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1719",8778,"Now was winter-tide upon them, when there was nought to do in field and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1720",8778,"acre, and but a little in the byre.  In years bygone, and even in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1721",8778,"last one, the witch had not spared Birdalone toil any the more, but had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1722",8778,"made errands for her amidst the snow and biting winds, or over the lake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1723",8778,"when it was laid with ice.  But now she bade her to nought save what she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1724",8778,"had a will to; whereby she lost but little, whereas Birdalone was well","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1725",8778,"willing to strive against wind and weather and the roughness of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1727",8778,"had to be done about the stead.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1728",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1729",8778,"Still did the witch give her hard words and rail at her for the most","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1730",8778,"part, but from the teeth outward only, and because she was wont thereto.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1731",8778,"Inwardly indeed she began to fear Birdalone, and deemed that she would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1732",8778,"one day have the mastery; and this led her into fierce and restless","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1733",8778,"moods; so that she would sit staring at the maiden’s beauty handling her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1734",8778,"knife withal, and scarce able to forbear her.  And in such a mood she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1735",8778,"once made occasion to chastise her as her wont had been erst, and looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1736",8778,"to see Birdalone rebel against her; but it fell out otherwise, for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1737",8778,"Birdalone submitted herself to her meekly and with a cheerful","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1753",8778,"her beauty; her limbs were rounded, her body fulfilled, her skin sleeked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1759",8778,"That spring-tide, amidst of April, she followed the witch-wife down to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1760",8778,"the Sending Boat for the third time; and there went everything as erst,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1761",8778,"and she deemed now that the lesson was well learned, and that she was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1762",8778,"well-nigh as wise as the witch herself therein.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1766",8778,"wood-mother, she spake to her even as they parted, and said: Mother, much","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1767",8778,"wisdom hast thou learned me, and now this at the last withal, that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1768",8778,"hitherto there has been shame in my life; and now fain were I to be done","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1769",8778,"with it.  Fair child, said Habundia, little is the shame though this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1770",8778,"woman hath had the upper hand of thee and hath used thee cruelly: how","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1771",8778,"mightest thou, a child, strive with her?  But now I see and know that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1772",8778,"there is an end of that; that she feareth thee now, and will never again","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1773",8778,"raise a hand against thee save thou fall wholly into her power; as thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1774",8778,"shalt not, my child.  Be comforted then for what is gone by!  Nay,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1775",8778,"mother, said Birdalone, it is not that which troubleth me; for, as thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1776",8778,"sayest, what else might I do?  But thy wisdom which thou hast set in my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1777",8778,"heart hath learned me that for these last months I have been meeting","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1778",8778,"guile with guile and lies with lies.  And now will I do so no more, lest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1779",8778,"I become a guileful woman, with nought good in me save the fairness of my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1780",8778,"body.  Wherefore hearken, sweet mother!  What is done, is done; but when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1781",8778,"it cometh to the day, which is speedily drawing nigh, that I must part","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1782",8778,"from thee, it may be for a long while, then will I not fare to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1783",8778,"Sending Boat by night and cloud and with hidden head, but will walk","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1787",8778,"out: O if I could but weep, as ye children of Adam!  O my grief and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1788",8778,"sorrow!  Child, child! then will betide that falling into her hands which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1789",8778,"I spake of e’en now; and then shall this wretch, this servant of evil,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1790",8778,"assuredly slay thee there and then, or will keep thee to torment thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1791",8778,"till thy life be but a slow death.  Nay, nay, do as I should do, and fare","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1792",8778,"with hidden head, and my ring on thy finger.  Or else, O child, how wilt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1794",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1795",8778,"Birdalone wept; but presently she fell to caressing the mother’s hand,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1796",8778,"and said: This is thy doing, wherein thou hast made me wise.  Yet fear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1797",8778,"not: for I deem that the witch-wife will not slay me, whereas she looketh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1798",8778,"to have some gain of me; moreover, in the evil of her heart is mingled","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1799",8778,"some love toward me, whereof, as erst I told thee, I have a morsel of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1800",8778,"compassion.  Mother, she will not slay me; and I say that she shall not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1801",8778,"torment me, for I will compel her to slay me else.  It is my mind that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1802",8778,"she will let me go.  Said the mother: Yea, mayhappen, yet but as a bird","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1803",8778,"with a string to its leg.  If it be so, said Birdalone, then let my luck","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1804",8778,"prevail over her guile; as well it may be, since I have known thee, O","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1809",8778,"heart which we, who are not children of Adam, may not understand; yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1824",8778,"left all girding at her even, and spake to her but little, save when she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1865",8778,"not the witch-wife in the chamber, though her bed looked as if it had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1866",8778,"been slept in.  Birdalone accounted little thereof, whereas the dame","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1867",8778,"would oft go on one errand or another much betimes in the morning.  Yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1868",8778,"was she somewhat glad, for she was nowise wishful for a wrangle with her.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1869",8778,"Withal, despite her valiancy, as may well be thought, she was all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1870",8778,"a-flutter with hopes and fears, and must needs refrain her body from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1871",8778,"overmuch quaking and restlessness if she might.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1872",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1873",8778,"Now she mingled the tress of the wood-mother’s hair with her own hair,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1874",8778,"but deemed it nought perilous to leave the ring yet sewn to her smock:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1875",8778,"she set some deal of bread and flesh in her scrip, lest her voyage should","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1876",8778,"be long, and then all simply stepped over the threshold of the House of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1878",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1879",8778,"She went straight to the strand aforesaid, seeing nought of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1880",8778,"witch-wife by the way; and when she came there, was about to turn","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1881",8778,"straightway to her left hand down to the creek, when it came into her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1882",8778,"mind that she would first swim over to Green Eyot for this last of times.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1883",8778,"For the eyot indeed she loved, and deemed it her own, since never had her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1884",8778,"evil dream, the witch, set foot thereon.  Moreover, she said to herself","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1885",8778,"that the cool lake would allay the fever of her blood, and make her flesh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1886",8778,"firmer and less timorous for the adventure.  And again, that if the witch","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1890",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1893",8778,"covered by the little ripple of the bight, to be a token of safety to her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1894",8778,"mistress.  To say sooth, now it was come so nigh to the deed, she shrank","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1895",8778,"aback a little, and was fain to dally with the time, and, if it might be,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1896",8778,"thrust something of no import betwixt her and the terror of the last","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"1898",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1899",8778,"Now she took the water, and rowed strongly with her lovely limbs till she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1900",8778,"came to the eyot, and there she went aland, and visited every place which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1901",8778,"had been kind to her; and kissed the trees and flowers that had solaced","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1902",8778,"her, and once more drew the birds and rabbits to sport with her; till","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1903",8778,"suddenly it came into her head that the time was wearing overfast.  Then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1904",8778,"she ran down to the water and plunged in, and swam over to the strand as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1905",8778,"fast as she might, and came aland there, thinking of nothing less than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1906",8778,"what had befallen.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1907",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1908",8778,"For lo! when she looked around for her raiment and her scrip, it was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1909",8778,"nowhere to be seen; straightway then it came into her mind, as in one","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1910",8778,"flash, that this was the witch’s work; that she had divined this deed of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1911",8778,"the flight, and had watched her, and taken the occasion of her nakedness","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1912",8778,"and absence that she might draw her back to the House of Captivity.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1913",8778,"this the more as the precious ring was sewn to Birdalone’s smock, and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1914",8778,"witch would have found it there when she handled the raiment.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1915",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1916",8778,"Birdalone wasted no time in seeking for the lost; she looked down on to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1917",8778,"the smooth sand, and saw there footprints which were not her own, and all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1918",8778,"those went straight back home to the house.  Then she turned, and for one","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1919",8778,"moment of time looked up toward the house, and saw plainly the witch come","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1920",8778,"out adoors, and the sun flashed from something bright in her hand.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1921",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1922",8778,"Then indeed she made no stay, but set off running at her swiftest along","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1923",8778,"the water-side toward the creek and the Sending Boat.  As is aforesaid","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1924",8778,"she was as fleet-foot as a deer, so but in a little space of time she had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1925",8778,"come to the creek, and leapt into the boat, panting and breathless.  She","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1926",8778,"turned and looked hastily along the path her feet had just worn, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1927",8778,"deemed she saw a fluttering and flashing coming along it, but some way","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"1928",8778,"off; yet was not sure, for her eyes were dizzy with the swiftness of her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2122",8778,"eat laid on a big kale-blade; and she said: Sisters, here are we hidden","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2123",8778,"by the trees, and cannot be seen from the house; therefore we may sit","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2124",8778,"here for a minute or two, while we talk together as to what may perchance","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2125",8778,"be done for the helping of this unhappy maiden, who is so fair and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2126",8778,"lovely, and hath strayed into so ugly a trap.  Then she said to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2153",8778,"she spake not, or answered at random, and to say sooth scarce heard their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2154",8778,"words: forsooth she was now become heart-sick, and was half dead for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2301",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2303",8778,"it soft for thee, dear stranger.  Yea, I must tell thee (and she reddened","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2304",8778,"therewith) that it is part of my charge to set thee in irons.  Birdalone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2305",8778,"smiled on her, and was over weary to ask what that meant, though she knew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2306",8778,"not.  But Atra went to the big coffer and opened it and thrust in her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2307",8778,"hands, and there was a jangling therewith, and when she turned about to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2310",8778,"for she may have a mind to go visit her prison, and if she find thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2311",8778,"there unshackled she shall be wroth, and oftenest her wrath hath a whip","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2312",8778,"in its hand.  And these are the lightest that I might find.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2313",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2314",8778,"Birdalone smiled again, and spake not, for she was very weary, and Atra","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2315",8778,"did the irons on her wrists and her ankles; and said thereafter: Yet bear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2316",8778,"in mind that it is a friend that hath the key of these things.  And now I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2317",8778,"will go away for a little, but I shall be on thine errands; for first I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2318",8778,"shall tell the mistress that thou art lying here shackled and in all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2319",8778,"wanhope; and next, by the will and command of her, I am to see that thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2320",8778,"be well fed and nourished to-day that thou mayst be the stronger for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2321",8778,"to-morrow.  Now if I may give thee rede, it is that thou forbear to open","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2322",8778,"the coffer yonder; for ugly things shalt thou find there, and that may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2330",8778,"reframed her, and took two of the pillows from the great chair and turned","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2331",8778,"aside into the other corner, her chains jingling as she went.  There she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2332",8778,"laid herself down, and nestled into the very wall-nook, and presently","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2348",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2350",8778,"for surely thou art famished, and it is now long past high noon.  Do off","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2362",8778,"was both plenteous and dainty, of venison and fowl, and cream and fruits","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2364",8778,"feasted in like manner, and the heart came back unto her, and her cheeks","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2365",8778,"grew rosy and her eyes glittered.  But she said: How if your lady were to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2366",8778,"come upon us here, and we so merry?  Said Atra: Out of the chair must","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2379",8778,"thee by words; for she biddeth me tell thee fair tales, forsooth, of what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2380",8778,"to-morrow shall be to thee, and the day after; and of how she shall begin","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2381",8778,"on thee, and what shall follow the beginning, and what thou mayst look","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2382",8778,"for after that.  For by all this she deemeth to lower thy pride and abate","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2383",8778,"thy valour, and to make every moment of to-day a terror to thy flesh and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2384",8778,"thy soul, so that thereby thou mayest thole the bitterness twice over.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2413",8778,"else who is of marvellous might, hath so ordained, that here everything","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2415",8778,"tending; and whatso we need of other matters the mistress taketh it for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2416",8778,"us from out of her Wonder-coffer, or suffereth us to take it for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2417",8778,"ourselves.  For thou must know that this land is one of the Isles of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2485",8778,"were a little payment to set against your saving of my life and my soul;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2486",8778,"and had I to go barefoot over red gleeds I would do it.  And yet, if I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2488",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2489",8778,"Said Atra: For this reason; thy ferry, the Sending Boat, wherein ye came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2490",8778,"hither, is even somewhat akin to thy mistress and ours; and the mistress","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2491",8778,"here hath banned it against bearing us; and now, were we so much as to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2492",8778,"touch it, such sore turmoil would arise, and such hideous noise as if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2493",8778,"earth and heaven were falling together; and the lady would be on us","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2494",8778,"straightway, and we should be undone; and, as thou shalt hear presently,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2495",8778,"this hath been proved.  But thou, thou art free of the said ferry.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2496",8778,"Forsooth I wot not why thy mistress banned it not against thee; maybe","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2497",8778,"because she deemed not that thou wouldst dare to use it or even go anigh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2499",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2502",8778,"even if she came upon it, and that if she did so find it, she would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2503",8778,"sicken her of the road thereto.  So now she told her friends the whole","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2504",8778,"tale thereof more closely than she had afore, save again what pertained","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2505",8778,"to Habundia; withal she told every word of what her mistress had said to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2506",8778,"her at that time when she changed her into a hind.  And Viridis heard and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2507",8778,"wondered, and pitied her.  But Atra sat somewhat downcast a while.  Then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2508",8778,"she said: However this may be, we will send thee forth to-morrow in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2509",8778,"dawn, and take the risk of what may befall thereafter; and thou shalt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2510",8778,"bear a token for each of those three that love us.  For we deem that they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2528",8778,"children, and thus grew up dear friends into maidenhood and womanhood.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2529",8778,"We were wooed by many men, but our hearts turned to none of them save","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2532",8778,"Viridis; and my man, the Black Squire.  But in this was unhap, that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2533",8778,"because of certain feuds which had endured from old time, this love was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2534",8778,"perilous unto them and us; so that we lived in doubt and unrest.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2535",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2536",8778,"Came a day, now three years ago, when the king of the whole land brought","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2537",8778,"his folk into our lakeside country, and there held a court and a mote in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2539",8778,"hallowed, and the Peace of God proclaimed at the blast of the war-horn,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2540",8778,"came we three woeful ladies clad in black and knelt before the lord king,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2541",8778,"and prayed him hearken us.  And he deemed that we were fair, so he had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2542",8778,"compassion on us, and raised us up, and bade us speak.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2543",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2544",8778,"So we told our tale, how that strife and wounds and death stood betwixt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2545",8778,"us and love; and we wept, and bewailed it, that our love must be slain","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2546",8778,"because men were wroth with each other and not with us.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2547",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2548",8778,"The king looked on us kindly, and said: Who be the swains for whom these","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2549",8778,"lovely damsels make such a piece of work?  So we named them, and said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2550",8778,"that they were there in the mote; and the king knew them for valiant men","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2551",8778,"who had done him good service; and he cried out their names, and bade","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2552",8778,"them stand forth out of the throng.  So forth they stood, the Golden","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2553",8778,"Knight, the Green Knight, and the Black Squire (and he also was now a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2558",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2559",8778,"So the king looked upon us and them, and laughed and said: Fair ladies,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2561",8778,"knights, whom I know for valiant men and true, take each his love by the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2562",8778,"hand, and let the weddings be to-morrow.  Who then were joyful but us?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2563",8778,"But even at the word the king spake arose great turmoil in the mote, for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2564",8778,"they smote the feud and contention awake, and men thronged forward","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2565",8778,"against each other, and swords were drawn and brandished.  But the king","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2566",8778,"arose in his place and spake long and deftly, and waxed exceeding wroth,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2567",8778,"while none heeded him nor hearkened.  And there stood our three men, who","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2568",8778,"laid no hand to hilt, but abode heart-whole by seeming amid the tumult.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2569",8778,"And lovely they were to look on.  At last the wise men and old barons","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2570",8778,"went between, and by fair words appeased the trouble, and the mote grew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2571",8778,"hushed.  Then spake the king: What is this, my thanes?  I had deemed that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2572",8778,"my foemen were far away, and that ye that here are were all friends unto","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2573",8778,"me and unto each other.  But now must we try another rede.  Therewith he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2574",8778,"turned unto our men and said: Ye champions, are ye so much in love with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2575",8778,"Love that ye will fight for him?  They all yeasaid that, and then the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2576",8778,"king said: Then do I declare that these three will hold the field against","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2577",8778,"all comers from matins till high noon, and that he who vanquisheth any","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2578",8778,"one of them shall have his lady and wed her if he will, and, if he will,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2579",8778,"shall ransom her.  And this field shall be foughten after two months’","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2580",8778,"frist in these fair meadows, when I return from the outermost marches of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2582",8778,"let all men bow to the judgment of God, whether he be well content or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2583",8778,"not, and this on peril of life and limb.  And now let there be deep peace","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2584",8778,"between all men meanwhile; and if any break the peace, be he high or low,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2585",8778,"rich or unrich, churl or earl, I swear it by the souls of my fathers that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2593",8778,"bitter against us as they had been; they put hand to pouch, and let rear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2594",8778,"for us a fair pavilion of painted timber, all hung with silk and pictured","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2597",8778,"done, it yet lacked a half month of the day of battle, and thither were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2598",8778,"we brought in triumph by the kindreds on a fair day of May, and there was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2599",8778,"not a sword or a spear amongst the whole company, and peaceful and merry","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2600",8778,"was all by seeming.  But we were not suffered to meet our lovers all this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2606",8778,"so longed for by us, yet now it was at hand it cast us into all unrest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2607",8778,"and trouble, so that we scarce knew whether to go, or stand, or sit, or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2608",8778,"what to do with our bodies.  Our folk, and all other men withal, were so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2624",8778,"afternoon, come into my boat and look on the face of the water, so calm","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2625",8778,"and fair as it is, and let their lovely hands go over the gunwale and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2626",8778,"play with the ripple, and so beguile this heavy time for a two hours; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2627",8778,"then give a little gift of a piece or two of silver to a poor carline,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2628",8778,"who loveth all fair ladies and bright warriors, and who needeth a little","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2632",8778,"hateful; but we looked on each other, and we found that we were utterly","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2633",8778,"weary of going up and down on the meadow, and lying about in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2634",8778,"pavilion, and it seemed as if this would give us a little rest; withal we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2635",8778,"saw not that the woman could do us any hurt, whereas we were three, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2636",8778,"strong enough as women go; nor were we mariners so evil but that we might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2637",8778,"sail or steer a boat at a pinch.  So we stepped into the boat","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2638",8778,"straightway, and the woman sat aft and paddled deftly with the steering","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2639",8778,"oar, and we glided away from the land.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2640",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2641",8778,"Soon we were come so far that we could but just see our pavilion through","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2642",8778,"the haze, which had somewhat thickened, and we said to the woman that she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2643",8778,"should go about and make for the shore, and that then we would go to and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2644",8778,"fro a while along by our stead.  She nodded yeasay, and began by seeming","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2645",8778,"to dight the craft for return.  But therewith the haze was grown suddenly","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2646",8778,"into a low cloud, which came down upon us from the south-west in the arms","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2647",8778,"of a cold breeze, that grew stronger every minute, so no wonder it was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2705",8778,"and drink, that ye may come hale and sound to your journey’s end, for I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2706",8778,"would not give starvelings to my dear sister.  Therewith she brought","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2714",8778,"and our hunger was now quenched, that we laid us down and slept at once,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2726",8778,"once more, I rede you be good, for it will be better for you.  Go forth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2727",8778,"now unto yonder house, and on the way ye shall meet the Queen of this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2728",8778,"land, and ye have nought to do but to say to her that ye are the Gift;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2732",8778,"the deed and spake the words ye wot of, and was gone north-away; and when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2733",8778,"we turned to seek for our boat wherein we had come hither, it was gone.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2734",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2735",8778,"We stood miserably for a while on the lip of the land, and then I said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2736",8778,"that we might as well go meet our fate as die there of grief and hunger.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2737",8778,"So we went, and came into those fair gardens, and as we went slowly up","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2738",8778,"toward the house came on us a woman clad in red scarlet and grandly","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2739",8778,"dight.  A big woman she was, and like to her that beguiled us, but far","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2740",8778,"younger and fairer of favour, foolish and proud of visage.  She stared on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2741",8778,"us, and seemed half afeard of us at first, but asked us what we were, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2742",8778,"I answered that we were the Gift.  The Gift? said she, what meaneth that?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2743",8778,"Will ye obey me in all things?  If ye gainsay it, ye will perish, unless","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2745",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2746",8778,"What might we do?  We all knelt down before her, and swore to do her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2747",8778,"will.  Then she said, after she had stared on us a while: Now I know: ye","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2748",8778,"are they of whom my sister spake, that she would fetch me a gift of a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2749",8778,"leash of damsels for my service.  Now I take the Gift and thank her good","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2750",8778,"heart.  But if ye would do my will, then . . .  But she broke off here","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2751",8778,"and stared at us a long while, and then she said: Now I know; she bade me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2752",8778,"treat you well, and hold my hand from you, or evil would come of it,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2753",8778,"belike at last my bane.  So go ye home to the house, and I will give you","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2754",8778,"meat and drink, and show you my stores and the Wonder-coffer, and ye","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2756",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2757",8778,"Even so did we; and we ate and drank and rested, and nought we lacked,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2758",8778,"save leave to depart home to our lovers, and some mistress better than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2759",8778,"this stupid and proud lump of flesh.  But the next morning when we came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2760",8778,"before the lady, she knew nought of what we were; and again we had to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2761",8778,"tell her that we were the Gift, and again she glared at us balefully, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2762",8778,"again she called to mind her sister and her rede concerning us.  And this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2763",8778,"went on for many days, till at last she got to know what we were; and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2764",8778,"followed her sister’s rede in that she never mishandled us, though we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2765",8778,"could see that it irked her to forbear, nor did she speak to us more","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2766",8778,"roughly than her fool’s wont was; and we had in our hands all that was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2767",8778,"needed for our sustenance, and lived easily enough.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2770",8778,"thy witch hither in her ferry, and she greeted us when we met, and asked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2771",8778,"us, grinning, had she not been kind to win us such good days?  Yea, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2772",8778,"over kind, said she, ye would deem me, knew ye what would have betid you","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2773",8778,"save for my good word.  Forsooth we deemed it no kind deed to steal us","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2774",8778,"from our lovers; but we kept good tongues in our heads, for thralls must","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2776",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2777",8778,"She went away in two days, but came again many times thereafter, till we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2778",8778,"won the secret of the Sending Boat, and her spell therewith; but we knew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2779",8778,"not that was banned against us.  Wherefore on a day in the grey of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2780",8778,"morning, when we had been on this isle somewhat less than a year, we went","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2781",8778,"down to it and stepped in, and reddened stem and stern and said the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2782",8778,"spell-words.  But straightway arose an hideous braying and clatter, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2783",8778,"thunder came therewith, and trembling of the earth, and the waters of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2784",8778,"lake arose in huge waves; nor might we move from our seats in the boat","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2785",8778,"till the two witches came running down to us, and haled us out ashore,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2788",8778,"whereof, dear guest, we shall tell thee nought.  But this came of it,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2839",8778,"and there did verily fall asleep, and slept till the key in the lock and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2840",8778,"the opening door awakened her, and Atra came stealing soft-footed into","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2841",8778,"the prison.  Eager she was and panting, and she kneeled before Birdalone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2842",8778,"and unlocked her leg-shackles, and then stood up and did the like by the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2845",8778,"deliverance, and ours maybe.  But come now at once: and again, wilt thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2846",8778,"pardon me, that we clothe thee not here for thy journey?  For from our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2847",8778,"own bodies must we clothe thee, and if by any hap our lady were to see","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2848",8778,"any one of us more or less unclad, it might draw her on to see what was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2850",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2871",8778,"said:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2872",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2873",8778,"Now, dear guest, and dearest messenger, it is our matter to clothe thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2874",8778,"from our very bodies; and do thou, Viridis, begin.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2875",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2876",8778,"Viridis came forward blushing, as her wont was, and took off her green","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2877",8778,"gown and laid it on the grass; then she set her hand to her smock, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2878",8778,"did it off, and stood naked, knee set to knee, and swaying like the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2879",8778,"willow branch; and then was seen all the dainty fashion of her body, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2880",8778,"how lovely of hue and sweet of flesh she was.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2881",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2882",8778,"But she said: Dear sister Birdalone, here is my smock, which I lend thee,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2909",8778,"Birdalone then shod herself, and though pity it were to hide her feet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2910",8778,"from the eyes of Earth, yet felt she the stouter-hearted thereby, and her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2911",8778,"cheeks flushed and her eyes brightened.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2912",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2913",8778,"Thereafter Aurea gave her withal a golden collar for the neck, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2914",8778,"Viridis a girdle of silver well-wrought, and Atra a gold finger-ring set","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2915",8778,"with a sapphire stone; and all these she did on her; but yet she knew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2916",8778,"that they were tokens to be delivered to the three lovers according as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2918",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2920",8778,"body in such wise that when thou comest to the mainland they may be seen","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2921",8778,"by knights seeking adventures, and that thou mayst answer to any who may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2926",8778,"as we shall tell thee, that they be truly these and none other; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2927",8778,"thereafter, when thou art made sure, they shall take of thee the raiment,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2928",8778,"the gems, and the Sending Boat, and come hither if they may.  And God","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2929",8778,"look to the rest!  But as for the token to be told aforesaid, we have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2930",8778,"determined that each of us shall tell thee privily what question thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2932",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2933",8778,"When she had done speaking, each came up to Birdalone and spake something","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2934",8778,"into her ear amidst blushes enough forsooth.  And what they said will be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2935",8778,"seen hereafter.  Then again said Atra: Now by this errand shall we be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2936",8778,"well paid for the care we have had of thee.  It may be, forsooth, that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2937",8778,"thou shalt not find our speech-friends; for they may be dead, or they may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2938",8778,"deem us untrue, and may have forsaken us and their land; and in any such","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2939",8778,"case thou art free of our errand; but whatsoever may betide us, God speed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2940",8778,"thee!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2941",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2942",8778,"Then Viridis drew forth a basket from under a bush, and said: We know not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2943",8778,"how long thy voyage may be, but some little provision for the way we may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2944",8778,"at least give thee: now wilt thou bear this aboard thyself; for we dare","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2945",8778,"not touch thy craft, nay, nor come nigh it, no one of us.  And she set","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2946",8778,"down the basket and cast her arms about her, and kissed her and wept over","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2947",8778,"her; and the other twain, they also kissed her lovingly.  Birdalone wept","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2948",8778,"even as Viridis, and said: May ye do well, who have been so kind to me;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2949",8778,"but now am I both so glad and so sorry, that the voice of me will not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2951",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2952",8778,"Therewith she took up her basket, and turned and went speedily to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2953",8778,"Sending Boat; and they beheld her how she stepped aboard and bared her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2954",8778,"arm, and drew blood from it with the pin of her girdle-buckle, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2955",8778,"therewith reddened stem and stern; and a pang of fear smote into their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2960",8778,"   Hast thou drunk, stern and bow;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2961",8778,"   Awake then, awake!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2962",8778,"   And the southward way take:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2963",8778,"   The way of the Wender forth over the flood,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2966",8778,"No cloud barred the gateway of the sun as she spoke; no wave rose upon","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2967",8778,"the bosom of the lake; no clatter nor tumult was there; but the Sending","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2968",8778,"Boat stirred, and then shot out swiftly into the wide water; and the sun","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2969",8778,"arose as they looked, and his path of light flashed on Birdalone’s golden","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2970",8778,"gown for a moment, and then it grew grey again, and presently she was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2975",8778,"took her, she knew not wherefore; her bosom swelled, her shoulders heaved","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"2990",8778,"friends and their errand, and would hope and pray for them; but again","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2991",8778,"would she fall to picture to herself what manner of men they were who","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2992",8778,"were so sore longed for by those three beauteous women; and she deemed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2993",8778,"that since they were thus desired, they must be fairer even than her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2994",8778,"friends of the isle; and again the nameless longing overtook her, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"2995",8778,"held her till it wearied her into sleep.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3000",8778,"were lying safe on a little sandy beach.  So she stepped out and looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3001",8778,"around, and deemed she could see great trees before her, and imagined","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3016",8778,"with light and fine white-golden hair, falling straight down and square","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3017",8778,"over his brow, and blue-grey eyes which were both kind and merry, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3018",8778,"shyly seeking as it were.  Plump and rosy he was, sturdy and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3025",8778,"playing with her, and now she turned her head to this and that one of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3035",8778,"tall and golden, he seemed somewhat afeard of so big a creature, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3062",8778,"joined them to their fellow, and suffered the younglings to play with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3063",8778,"them.  Moreover there were rabbits great plenty scuttling in and out of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3064",8778,"the brakes and the rough ground upon the way, and the younglings beheld","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3065",8778,"them, and the little lad said, after his fashion: Why do the rabbits run","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3066",8778,"away from us, and the goats follow us?  Now, sooth to say, Birdalone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3067",8778,"scarce knew why, and had no word ready for the child; but she said at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3068",8778,"last: Mayhappen they will come to me; so it was once when I dwelt away","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3069",8778,"from here.  Shall I go fetch thee one?  The little ones yeasaid that,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3070",8778,"though somewhat shyly and doubtfully.  Then said Birdalone: Do ye,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3071",8778,"sweetlings, abide me here, and go not away.  They nodded their heads","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3074",8778,"out of eye-shot of the babes.  Before she was well-nigh to the little","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3075",8778,"beasts, she fell to talking to them in a low sweet voice, as had been her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3076",8778,"wont when she was little; and when they heard it, those who had not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3077",8778,"scuttled away at first glance of her, fell to creeping little short","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3078",8778,"creeps one to the other, as their manner is when they be alone together","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3080",8778,"about her feet while she stood, still talking unto them.  Then she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3081",8778,"stooped down and took up one in her arms and caressed it, and then laid","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3082",8778,"him down and took up another, and so with three or four of them; and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3083",8778,"fell to pushing them, and rolling them over with her foot; then she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3084",8778,"turned a little away from them toward the children, and then a little","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3085",8778,"more, and the rabbits fell to following her, and she turned and took up","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3086",8778,"one in her arms, and went straight on toward the children, but turning","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3088",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3089",8778,"As to the babes, she saw the goats, of whom were now a dozen, or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3090",8778,"thereabouts, standing together in a kind of ring, and the little ones","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3091",8778,"going from one to the other playing with them happily.  But presently the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3092",8778,"lad turned and saw her coming with her tail of little beasts, and he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3093",8778,"cried out a great Oh and ran toward her straightway, and the maiden after","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3095",8778,"it to him smiling, and said: Lo now! here be pretty playmates; but look","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3096",8778,"to it that ye be soft and kind with them, for they are but feeble people.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3097",8778,"So the younglings fell to sporting with their new friends, and for a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3098",8778,"little forgat both goats and golden lady; but the goats drew nigh, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3099",8778,"stood about them bleating, nor durst they run at the rabbits to butt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3100",8778,"them, because of Birdalone and the little ones.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3101",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3102",8778,"There then stood the slim maiden, tall and gleaming above her little","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3104",8778,"forgotten.  But as she looked up toward the grey walls, lo, new tidings","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3105",8778,"to hand!  For she saw an old man with a long white beard slowly coming","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3106",8778,"toward them: she started not, but abode his coming quietly, and as he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3107",8778,"drew nigh she could see of him that he was big and stark, and, old as he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3108",8778,"was, not yet bowed with his many years.  He stood looking on this Queen","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3109",8778,"and her court silently a while, and then he spake: Such a sight I looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3110",8778,"not to see on this Isle of the Young and the Old.  She said: But","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3111",8778,"meseemeth it is full meet that these younglings should sport with the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3112",8778,"creatures.  He smiled and said: Such a voice I looked not to hear on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3113",8778,"Isle of the Young and the Old.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3114",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3115",8778,"Birdalone became somewhat troubled, and said: Am I welcome here? for if I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3116",8778,"be not, I will pray thy leave to depart.  He said: Thou art as welcome as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3117",8778,"the very spring, my child; and if thou have a mind to abide here, who","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3118",8778,"shall naysay thee?  For surely thou art young; nay, in regard to me thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3120",8778,"thou art true and kind, as is clear to be seen by thy playing with these","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3122",8778,"thou hast brought hither somewhat less than peace.  And he smiled upon","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3133",8778,"hand now is the quenching of thine hunger; for I will not ask thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3134",8778,"whereby thou camest, since by water thou needs must have come.  Wherefore","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3135",8778,"now I bid thee to our house, and these little ones shall go with us, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3138",8778,"and these nibblers also; for we have a potherb garden by our house, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3139",8778,"are fain to keep the increase of the same for ourselves.  Birdalone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3140",8778,"laughed, and shook her skirts at the coneys, and they all scuttled away","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3141",8778,"after the manner of their kind.  Thereat the little lad looked downcast","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3142",8778,"and well-nigh tearful, but the maid stamped her foot, and roared","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3193",8778,"now wouldest thou tell me about thee, what thou art, and what are these","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3194",8778,"walls about us here?  Said he: I doubt if I may do so, this day at least.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3195",8778,"But belike thou shalt abide with us, and then some day the word may come","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3196",8778,"into my mouth.  She held her peace, and into her mind it came that it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3197",8778,"would be sweet to dwell there, and watch those fair children waxing, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3198",8778,"the lad growing up and loving her; yea, even she fell to telling up the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3199",8778,"years which would make him a man, and tried to see herself, how she would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3200",8778,"look, when the years were worn thereto.  Then she reddened at the untold","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3201",8778,"thought, and looked down and was silent.  But the elder looked on her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3202",8778,"anxiously, and said: It will be no such hard life for thee, for I have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3203",8778,"still some work in me, and thou mayst do something in spite of thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3204",8778,"slender and delicate fashion.  She laughed merrily, and said: Forsooth,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3205",8778,"good sire, I might do somewhat more than something; for I am deft in all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3206",8778,"such work as here ye need; so fear not but I should earn my livelihood,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3207",8778,"and that with joy.  Merry days shall we have then, said he.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3208",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3209",8778,"But therewith her eye caught the gleam of her golden sleeve, and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3210",8778,"thought of Aurea, and her heart smote her for her errand; then she laid","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3211",8778,"her hand on her girdle and called to mind little Viridis, and the glitter","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3212",8778,"of the ring on her finger brought the image of Atra before her; then she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3213",8778,"rose up and said: Thou art kind, father, but I may not; I have an errand;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3214",8778,"this day must I depart from thee.  He said: Thou hast broken my heart; if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3215",8778,"I were not so old, I would weep.  And he hung adown his head.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3216",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3217",8778,"She stood before him abashed, as if she had done him a wrong.  At last he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3218",8778,"looked up and said: Must it be to-day?  Wilt thou not abide with us","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3219",8778,"night-long, and go thy ways in the early morning?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3220",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3221",8778,"Now she scarce knew how to gainsay him, so wretched as the old carle","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3222",8778,"looked; so it came to this, that she yeasaid the abiding till to-morrow.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3223",8778,"Then suddenly he became gay and merry, and he kissed her hand, and fell","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3224",8778,"to much speaking, telling tales of little import concerning his earlier","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3225",8778,"days.  But when she asked him again of how he came there, and what meant","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3226",8778,"the great ruined house, then he became foolish and wandering, and might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3227",8778,"scarce answer her; whereas otherwise he was a well-spoken old carle of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3228",8778,"many words, and those of the grandest.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3229",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3230",8778,"Then changed his mood again, and he fell to bewailing her departure, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3231",8778,"how that henceforth he should have none to speak to him with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3232",8778,"understanding.  Then she smiled on him and said: But yonder babes will","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3233",8778,"grow up; month by month they will be better fellows unto thee.  Fair","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3234",8778,"child, he said, thou dost not know.  My days to come are but few, so that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3235",8778,"I should see but little of their waxing in any case.  But furthermore,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3236",8778,"wax they will not; such as they be now, such shall they be till I at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3237",8778,"least see the last of them and the earth.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3238",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3239",8778,"Birdalone wondered at this word, and the place seemed changed to her,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3240",8778,"yea, was grown somewhat dreary; but she said to the carle: And thou, dost","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3241",8778,"thou change in any wise, since these change not?  He laughed somewhat","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3242",8778,"grimly, and said: The old that be here change from old to dead; how could","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3243",8778,"I change to better?  Yea, the first thing I had to do here was to bury an","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3244",8778,"old man.  Quoth she: And were there any children here then?  Yea, said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3245",8778,"he; these same, or I can see no difference in them.  Said Birdalone: And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3246",8778,"how long ago is that?  And how camest thou hither?  His face became","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3247",8778,"foolish, and he gibbered rather than spake: No, I wot not; no, no, no,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3248",8778,"not a whit, a whit.  But presently after was he himself again, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3249",8778,"telling her a tale of a great lady of the earl-folk, a baron’s dame, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3250",8778,"how dear he was unto her.  He lay yet on the grass, and she stood before","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3251",8778,"him, and presently he put forth a hand to her gown-hem and drew her to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3252",8778,"him thereby, and fell to caressing her feet; and Birdalone was ashamed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3253",8778,"thereat, and a little angry.  He was nought abashed, but sat up and said:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3254",8778,"Well, since thou must needs depart to-morrow, be we merry to-day.  And I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3255",8778,"pray thee talk much with me, fair child, for sweet and sweet is thy voice","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3256",8778,"to hearken.  Then he arose and said: Now will I fetch thee somewhat to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3257",8778,"eke the joy of us both.  And he turned therewith and went into the house.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3258",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3259",8778,"Birdalone stood there, and was now perplexed and downhearted; for now the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3260",8778,"look of the elder scarce liked her, and the children began to seem to her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3261",8778,"as images, or at the best not more to her than the rabbits or the goats;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3262",8778,"and she rued her word that she would abide there the night through.  For","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3263",8778,"she said to herself: I fear some trap or guile; is the witch behind this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3264",8778,"also? for the old man is yet stark, and though he be foolish at whiles,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3265",8778,"yet may wizardry have learned him some guile.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3266",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3267",8778,"With that cometh out the carle again, bearing a little keg and a mazer","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3268",8778,"roughly wrought; and he came to Birdalone, and sat down, and bade her sit","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3269",8778,"by him, and said to her: Maybe I shall hear more of thy sweet voice when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3270",8778,"thy sweet lips have been in the cup.  Therewith he poured forth into the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3271",8778,"mazer, and handed it to Birdalone, and lo! it was clear and good mead.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3272",8778,"She sipped thereof daintily, and, to say sooth, was well-pleased","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3273",8778,"therewith, and it stirred the heart in her.  But then she gave back the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3274",8778,"cup to the elder, and would no more of it.  As for him, he drank what was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3275",8778,"left in the cup, looking over the rim thereof meanwhile; and then filled","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3276",8778,"himself another, and another, and yet more.  But whereas it might have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3277",8778,"been looked for that his tongue should be loosened by the good mead into","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3278",8778,"foolishness and gibbering, he became rather few-spoken, and more","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3279",8778,"courteous and stately even than he had been at the first.  But in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3280",8778,"end, forsooth, he was forgetting Birdalone, what she was, and he fell","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3281",8778,"a-talking, always with much pomp and state, as if to barons and earls,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3282",8778,"and great ladies; till suddenly his head fell back, he turned over on his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3283",8778,"face, and all wit was gone from him.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3284",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3285",8778,"At first, then, Birdalone was afraid that he was dead, or nigh unto","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3286",8778,"death, and she knelt down and raised his head, and fetched water and cast","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3287",8778,"it over his face.  But when she saw that he was breathing not so ill, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3288",8778,"that the colour was little changed in his lips and cheeks, she knew that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3289",8778,"it was but the might of the mead that had overcome him.  Wherefore she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3290",8778,"laid him so that he was easy, and then stood up and looked about her, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3291",8778,"saw the children playing together a little way off; and nought else anigh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3292",8778,"her, save the birds in the brake, or flying on their errands eagerly from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3293",8778,"place to place.  Then, as it were, without her will being told them, her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3294",8778,"limbs and her feet turned her about to the shore where lay the Sending","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3295",8778,"Boat, and she went speedily but quietly thitherward, her heart beating","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3296",8778,"quick, for fear lest something should yet stay her, and her eyes glancing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3297",8778,"from brake to bush, as if she looked to see some enemy, old or new, come","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3298",8778,"out thence.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3299",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3300",8778,"So now her will was clear enough to her feet, and they brought her down","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3301",8778,"to the water-side and the long strand, past which the wide water lay","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3302",8778,"windless and gleaming in the hot afternoon.  Then lightly she stepped","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3303",8778,"aboard, and awoke the Sending Boat with blood-offering, and it obeyed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3313",8778,"and green, like a meadow exceeding fair, on the bosom of the water, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3321",8778,"the meadow-sweet amongst which she landed brought back unto her the image","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3337",8778,"through the adventure to the end; so she went on toward the house","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3351",8778,"quieter and calmer amongst the great folk and mighty whom she looked to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3353",8778,"that she heard no sound come from that great and goodly hall, so that she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3359",8778,"many folk, and their hands were reached out to knife and to dish, and to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3360",8778,"platter and cup; but such a hush there was within, that the song of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3361",8778,"garden birds without sounded to her as loud as they were the voices of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3363",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3371",8778,"none moved nor spake.  And the fear increased in her amidst that hush,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3372",8778,"and weighed so heavy on her heart, that at last she might endure it no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3373",8778,"longer, but fell swooning to the floor.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3375",8778,"When she came to herself; and the swoon-dreams had left her, she saw by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3376",8778,"the changing of the sun through the hall-windows, that she had lain there","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3377",8778,"long, more nearly two hours than one; and at first she covered her face","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3378",8778,"with her hands as she crouched there, that she might not see the sight of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3379",8778,"the silent hall, for yet was it as hushed as before.  Then slowly she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3380",8778,"arose, and the sound of her raiment and her stirring feet was loud in her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3381",8778,"ears.  But when she was upright on her feet, she hardened her heart, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3382",8778,"went forth into the hall, and no less was her wonder than erst.  For when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3383",8778,"she came close to those ladies as they sat at table, and her raiment","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3384",8778,"brushed the raiment of the serving-women as she passed by, then saw she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3385",8778,"how no breath came from any of these, and that they neither spake nor","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3386",8778,"moved, because they were dead.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3387",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3388",8778,"At first, then, she thought to flee away at once, but again she had mind","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3389",8778,"of her errand, and so went up the hall, and so forth on to the dais; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3390",8778,"there again, close by the high table, she saw new tidings.  For there was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3391",8778,"set a bier, covered with gold and pall, and on it was laid a tall man, a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3392",8778,"king, belted and crowned; and beside the said bier, by the head of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3393",8778,"king, knelt a queen of exceeding goodly body, clad all in raiment of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3394",8778,"pearl and bawdekin; and her hands were clasped together, and her mouth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3395",8778,"was drawn, and her brow knit with the anguish of her grief.  But athwart","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3396",8778,"the king’s breast lay a naked sword all bloody; and this Birdalone noted,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3397",8778,"that whereas the lady was of skin and hue as if she were alive, the king","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3398",8778,"was yellow as wax, and his cheeks were shrunken, and his eyes had been","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3399",8778,"closed by the wakers of the dead.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3400",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3401",8778,"Long Birdalone looked and wondered; and now if her fear were less, her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3402",8778,"sorrow was more for all that folk sitting there dead in their ancient","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3403",8778,"state and pomp.  And was not the thought clean out of her head, that yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3404",8778,"they might awake and challenge her, and that she might be made one of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3405",8778,"that silent company.  Withal she felt her head beginning to fail her, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3406",8778,"she feared that she might swoon again and never waken more, but lie for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3408",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3409",8778,"So then she refrained her both of fear and sorrow, and walked speedily","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3410",8778,"down the hall, looking neither to the right nor left: and she came forth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3411",8778,"into the pleasance, but stayed there nought, so nigh it seemed to that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3413",8778,"and dear seemed its hot sunshine and noisy birds and rustling leaves.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3414",8778,"Nevertheless, so great was the tumult of her spirits, that once more she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3596",8778,"she laid herself down on that waste, and made up her mind to sleep if she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3615",8778,"abundant locks which decked her so gloriously; she drew two hairs from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3617",8778,"in its place again, and then, pale and trembling, fell to striking a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3618",8778,"light, and when she had the tinder burning, she cried out:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3619",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3620",8778,"O wood-mother, wood-mother!  How then may we meet again as thou didst","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3629",8778,"rather lying thereon, faint and colourless, and it was of the shape of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3649",8778,"sending to her help, and she fell a-weeping where she stood, for love of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3651",8778,"arms to the north quarter, and said blessings on her in a voice faint for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3679",8778,"good while of the night.  When she awoke in the morning there was no land","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3733",8778,"her simple speech and sweet voice, and the goodliness of her face and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3734",8778,"eyes.  But he said: Lady, thine errand hath nought to do with it, it is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3735",8778,"thy womanhood that bars our door.  For all we are bound by oath not to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3736",8778,"suffer a woman to abide in this castle till our lords take the bann off,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3737",8778,"and bid us open to women.  She smiled faintly, and said: If I might but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3738",8778,"see thy lords then, since thou art not master here.  He said: They are","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3739",8778,"away, and will not be back till to-morrow morning; and I wot not the hour","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3740",8778,"of their return.  And yet, said he, I would we might help thee somewhat.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3741",8778,"O I pray thee, I pray thee! she said, or mine errand will come to nought","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3742",8778,"after all.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3743",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3744",8778,"Therewith came another man down the stair, and stood by the old knight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3745",8778,"and plucked his sleeve, and fell to talk with him softly.  This man was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3746",8778,"by his habit a religious, and was a younger man than the others, it might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3747",8778,"be of five and thirty winters, and he was fair of favour.  While they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3748",8778,"spake together Birdalone sat her down again, and was well-nigh spent.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3749",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3750",8778,"At last the old man spake: Damsel, he said, we deem we may suffer thee to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3751",8778,"enter the castle since thy need is so great, and have a meal’s meat at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3752",8778,"our hands, and yet save our oath, if thou depart thence by the landward","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3753",8778,"gate before sunset.  Will this serve thee?  Fair sir, said Birdalone, it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3754",8778,"will save my life and mine errand; I may say no more words for my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3755",8778,"faintness, else would I thank thee.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3756",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3757",8778,"She stood up on her feet, and the old man-at-arms reached out his hand to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3758",8778,"her, and she took it and came her ways up the stair, but found herself","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3759",8778,"but feeble.  But the priest (forsooth he was chaplain of the castle)","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3760",8778,"helped her on the other side.  But when she stood on the level stones by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3761",8778,"the water-gate, she turned to the old man and said: One thing I will ask","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3762",8778,"of thee, Is this place one of the Wondrous Isles?  The elder shook his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3763",8778,"head.  We know not the Wondrous Isles, said he; this castle is builded on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3764",8778,"the mainland.  Her face flushed for joy at the word, and she said: One","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3765",8778,"thing I will crave of thee, to wit, that thou wilt leave my barge lying","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3766",8778,"here untouched till thy masters come back, and wilt give command that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3767",8778,"none meddle therewith.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3768",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3769",8778,"He would have answered, but the priest brake in, and said: This will he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3770",8778,"do, lady, and he is the castellan, and moreover he will swear to obey","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3771",8778,"thee herein.  And therewith he drew forth a cross with God nailed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3772",8778,"thereon, and the castellan swore on it with a good will.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3773",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3774",8778,"Then the priest drew Birdalone on, and between them they brought her into","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3775",8778,"the great hall, and set her down in a chair and propped her with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3776",8778,"cushions.  And when she was thus at rest, she began to weep somewhat, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3777",8778,"the castellan and the priest stood by and comforted her; for themseemed,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3778",8778,"despite her grief, that she had brought the sun into their house.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3779",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3780",8778,"Next were victual brought unto her of broth and venison, and good wine","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3781",8778,"and cates and strawberries; and she was not so famished but she might eat","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3782",8778,"and drink with a good will.  But when she was done, and had rested a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3783",8778,"little, the castellan stood up and said: Lady, the sun is gone off the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3784",8778,"western windows now, and I must save mine oath; but ere thou depart, I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3785",8778,"were fain to hear thy voice giving me pardon for my evil cheer and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3786",8778,"thrusting of thee forth.  And therewith he put one knee to the ground,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3787",8778,"and took her hand and kissed it.  But Birdalone was grown merry again,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3788",8778,"and she laughed and said: What pardon thou canst have of me, kind knight,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3789",8778,"thou hast; but now methinks thou makest overmuch of me, because I am the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3790",8778,"only woman who hath come into thy castle.  I am but a simple maiden,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3791",8778,"though mine errand be not little.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3792",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3793",8778,"Forsooth she wondered that the stark and gruff old man was so changed to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3794",8778,"her in little space; for nought she knew as yet how the sight of her cast","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3795",8778,"a hot gleed of love into the hearts of them who beheld her.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3796",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3797",8778,"Now Birdalone arose; but the castellan knelt at her feet, and kissed her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3798",8778,"hand again, and again, and yet again.  Then he said: Thou art gracious","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3799",8778,"indeed.  But methinks the father here will lead thee out-a-gates; for he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3800",8778,"may show thee a lair, wherein thou shalt be safe enough to-night; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3801",8778,"to-morrow may bring new tidings.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3802",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3803",8778,"So the priest made obeisance to her and led her down the hall, and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3804",8778,"castellan’s eyes were following them till the screen hid them.  The","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3805",8778,"priest left her in the hall-porch a while, and went into the buttery, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3806",8778,"came back with a basket of meat and drink, and they went forth at the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3816",8778,"were little copses here and there.  When they were fairly out of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3817",8778,"gate, the priest reached for Birdalone’s hand, and she let him take it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3818",8778,"and lead her along thereby, thinking no evil; but he might scarce speak","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3819",8778,"for a while, so great was the stir in his heart at the touch of her bare","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3820",8778,"flesh.  But Birdalone spake and said: Thou art kind, father, to lead me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3821",8778,"on my way thus.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3822",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3823",8778,"He answered in a husky voice with his eyes cast down, and forsooth set on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3824",8778,"the feet of her: It is not far that I am leading thee; there is a broken","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3825",8778,"cot by the copse at the turn of the road yonder, where thou mayst abide","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3826",8778,"to-night; it is better lodging than none, evil as it is for such an one","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3827",8778,"as thou.  Birdalone laughed: Worse have I had, said she, than would be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3828",8778,"the copse without the cot.  And she thought withal of the prison in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3829",8778,"Isle of Increase Unsought.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3830",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3832",8778,"somewhat the moodiness of his desire, and looked up and said: I shall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3833",8778,"tell thee, lady, that I suppose thou hast more errand with my lords than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3834",8778,"to crave lodging of them despite the custom of the castle.  Nay, I have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3835",8778,"an inkling of what thine errand may be, whereof more anon; but now shall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3836",8778,"I tell thee what is best for thee to do so as to have speech of them the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3837",8778,"soonest.  They have gone forth with some of our lads to gather venison,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3838",8778,"or it may be beeves and muttons for our victualling, and somewhat of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3839",8778,"battle may they have had on the way, for ill neighbours have we.  But if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3840",8778,"they come back unfoughten they will be wending this road, and must needs","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3841",8778,"pass by thy copse-side; and if thou be sleeping the noise of them will","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3842",8778,"full surely awaken thee.  Then all thou hast to do is to come forth and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3843",8778,"stand in the way before them, that they may see thee; and when once they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3845",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3846",8778,"I thank thee heartily for thy rede, said Birdalone; but I would ask thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3847",8778,"two things: first, what is the name of the castle behind us? and second,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3848",8778,"why have ye the custom of shutting the door upon women?  Said the priest:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3849",8778,"The castle is called in this country-side, the White Ward by the Water;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3850",8778,"but within there we call it the Castle of the Quest; and thus is it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3851",8778,"called because my lords are seeking their loves whom they have lost; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3852",8778,"they have sworn an oath that no woman shall enter therein till their own","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3853",8778,"loves have trodden its floors.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3854",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3855",8778,"Rose the heart of Birdalone at that word, and she deemed indeed that she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3856",8778,"was come thither whereas her she-friends would have had her.  The priest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3857",8778,"beheld her and saw how her beauty was eked by that gladness, and he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3858",8778,"scarce knew how to contain himself; and might speak no word awhile; then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3859",8778,"he said: Hearken further concerning thy matter; if my lords be tarried,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3860",8778,"and come not by matin-song, then I doubt not but the castellan will send","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3861",8778,"folk to see to thee.  He looked down therewith and said: I will come to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3862",8778,"thee myself; and will bring thee men-at-arms, if need be.  But sometime","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3863",8778,"to-morrow morning my lords will come, save mischief hath betid, which God","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3864",8778,"forbid.  And he crossed himself; then he looked up and full in her face,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3865",8778,"and said: But keep thine heart up; for whatsoever may betide, thou shalt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3866",8778,"not be left uncared for.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3867",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3868",8778,"Said Birdalone: I see of thee that thou art become my good friend, and it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3869",8778,"rejoiceth my heart; I shall be well at ease to-night in thy cot, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3870",8778,"to-morrow morn I shall be valiant to do thy bidding.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3871",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3872",8778,"The sweetness of her speech so overcame him, that he but looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3873",8778,"confusedly on her, as if he scarce heard her; and they went on together","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3874",8778,"without more words, till he said: Here are we at the cot, and I will show","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3875",8778,"thee thy chamber.  So he led her to a little thatched bower, built with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3876",8778,"walls of wattle-work daubed with clay, which stood without the remnant of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3877",8778,"the cot: it was clean and dry, for the roof was weather-tight; but there","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3878",8778,"was nought in it at all save a heap of bracken in a corner.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3879",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3880",8778,"There stood the priest, still holding Birdalone’s hand, and spake not,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3881",8778,"but looked about, yet always covertly on Birdalone; but in a while he let","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3882",8778,"go her hand, and seemed to wake up, and said: This it is; a sorry place","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3883",8778,"enough, were it even for a gangrel body.  Even so am I, quoth she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3884",8778,"laughing; and thou mayest look to it, that herein I shall rest full","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3885",8778,"happily.  Then he gave her a horn, drawing it from out of the basket of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3886",8778,"victual, which he now set down on the ground; and he said: If thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3887",8778,"shouldst deem thee hard bestead, then wind this horn, and we shall know","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3888",8778,"its voice up there and come to help thee.  Now I give thee good-night.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3889",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3890",8778,"She thanked him sweetly, and he went slowly out of the bower, but was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3891",8778,"scarce gone ere he came back again, and said: One thing I may perchance","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3892",8778,"tell thee without drawing thine anger on my head; to wit, that I it was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3893",8778,"who said to the castellan that he should take thee in.  Wilt thou say","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3894",8778,"aught to this?  She said: I will thank thee again and again; for it was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3895",8778,"the saving of my life and mine errand.  And clearer is it now than ever","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3896",8778,"that thou art a good friend unto me.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3897",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3898",8778,"As she looked on him and caressed him with kind eyes, she saw that his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3899",8778,"brow was knit, and his face troubled, and she said to him: What ails","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3900",8778,"thee? art thou wroth with me in any wise?  O no, said he; how should I be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3901",8778,"wroth with thee!  But there is a thing I would ask of thee.  Yea, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3902",8778,"what? said she.  He said: Nay, I may not, I may not.  It shall be for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3903",8778,"to-morrow, or another day.  He spake it looking down, and in a broken","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3904",8778,"voice; and she wondered somewhat at him, but not much, deeming that he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3905",8778,"was troubled by something which had nought to do with her, and which he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3906",8778,"might refrain from thinking of, even before a stranger.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3907",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3908",8778,"But presently he caught her hand and kissed it, and bade her good-night","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"3912",8778,"I was!  Birdalone turned then to her bracken bed, and found it sweet and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3913",8778,"clean; and she was at rest and peace in her mind, albeit her body was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"3914",8778,"exceeding weary.  She felt happy in the little lonely cot, and her heart","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4076",8778,"kissing her feet; or, if you will, Atra’s shoon which covered them.  When","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4081",8778,"less goodly than the other twain.  He also was a young man of not over","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4082",8778,"five and twenty years, slim and lithe, with much brown hair; his face","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4083",8778,"tanned so dark that his eyes gleamed light from amidst it; his chin was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4084",8778,"round and cloven, his mouth and nose excellently fashioned; little hair","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4093",8778,"she happened on them in like case as she was that time?  And she settled","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4094",8778,"with herself that they would have been no less kind.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4095",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4096",8778,"Now spake the Golden Knight, and said: Will the kind maiden do her errand","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4097",8778,"to us here and now? for we be eager and worn with trouble.  Birdalone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4098",8778,"looked adown and was somewhat confused.  Fair sirs, said she, I will do","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4099",8778,"your will herein.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4100",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4101",8778,"But the Black Squire looked on her and saw that she was troubled, and he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4102",8778,"said: Your pardon, fair fellows, but is it not so that we have an house","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4103",8778,"somewhat anigh, not ill purveyed of many things?  By your leave I would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4104",8778,"entreat this kind and dear lady to honour us so much as to enter the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4105",8778,"Castle of the Quest with us, and abide there so long as she will; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4106",8778,"therein may she tell us all her errand at her leisure; and already we may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4107",8778,"see and know, that it may not be aught save a joyous one.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4108",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4109",8778,"Then spake the Golden Knight, and said: I will ask the lady to pardon me,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4110",8778,"and will now join my prayer to thine, brother, that she come home with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4111",8778,"us.  Lady, he said, wilt thou not pardon me, that in the eager desire to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4112",8778,"hear tidings of my speech-friend I forgat all else.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4113",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4114",8778,"And therewithal he knelt before her, and took her hand and kissed it; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4115",8778,"for all his fierce eyes and his warrior’s mien, she deemed him kind and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4116",8778,"friendly.  Then needs must the Green Knight kneel and kiss also, though","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4117",8778,"he had no pardon to crave; but a fair sweet lad she thought him, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4118",8778,"again her heart swelled with joy to think that her friend Viridis had so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4122",8778,"turned away a little toward their horses; and he knelt down on both knees","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4123",8778,"before Birdalone and took her right arm above the wrist, and looked at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4124",8778,"the hand and kissed it as if it were a relic, but stood not up; and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4125",8778,"stood bending over him, and a new sweetness entered into her, the like of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4126",8778,"which she had never felt.  But as for the Black Squire, it seemed that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4127",8778,"one hand would not suffice him, and he took her left hand and fell to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4128",8778,"kissing it, and then both the hands together all over the backs of them,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4129",8778,"and then the palms thereof, and he buried his face in the two palms, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4130",8778,"held them to his cheeks; and the dear hands suffered it all, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4131",8778,"consented to the embracing of his cheeks.  But Birdalone deemed that this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4132",8778,"was the kindest and sweetest of the three kind warriors, and sorry she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4133",8778,"was when he let go her hands and stood up.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4134",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4135",8778,"His face was flushed, but his speech calm, as he spake so that the other","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4136",8778,"knights might hear him: Now will we straight to the castle, lady, and we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4137",8778,"will ask thee which of us three thou wilt honour by riding his horse","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4140",8778,"horses.  But she laughed, and turning a little, pointed to the castle,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4141",8778,"and said: Nay, sweet lords, but I will fare afoot, such a little way as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4145",8778,"afoot with thee.  Nay, nay, she said; I have nought to carry but myself;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4146",8778,"but ye have your byrnies and your other armour, which were heavy for you","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4148",8778,"mount your horses, and ride and run about the meadow with tossing manes","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4167",8778,"over the meadow, but ever came back to Birdalone as she went her ways,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4240",8778,"tale of thy giving this golden gown to Aurea, and that same tale shalt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4247",8778,"lamented the niggard ways of her said kinswoman, and told how she had no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4248",8778,"goodly gown to make her fair when feasts were toward; but I laughed at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4249",8778,"her, and told her that so clad as she was (and her attire was verily but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4250",8778,"simple) she was fairer than any other; and then, as ye may wot, there was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4251",8778,"kissing and clipping between us; but at last, as from the first I meant","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4253",8778,"with a better in all the country-side; but I said that in return I must","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4254",8778,"have the gown she went in then, which had so long embraced her body and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4256",8778,"part of her.  That she promised me with kisses, and I went away as merry","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4257",8778,"as a bird.  Straightway thereafter I did do make this very gown, which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4258",8778,"thou bearest, dear maiden, and on the appointed day she came out to me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4259",8778,"unto the same place clad as she was before; but the new gown I had with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4260",8778,"me.  Hard by our trysting-place was a hazel-copse thick enow, for it was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4261",8778,"midsummer, and she said she would go thereinto and shift gowns, and bear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4264",8778,"her from evil things, beasts or men; and withal to see her do off the old","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4266",8778,"went to make the grace of her flanks and her hips.  And again was she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4267",8778,"merry, and she said: Come, then, thou Thomas unbelieving, and see the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4268",8778,"side of me.  So we went into that cover together, and she did off her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4269",8778,"gown before mine eyes, and stood there in her white coat with her arms","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4270",8778,"bare, and her shoulders and bosom little covered, and she was as lovely","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4271",8778,"as a woman of the faery.  Then I made no prayer unto her for leave, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4272",8778,"took my arms about her, and kissed her arms and shoulders and bosom all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4273",8778,"she would suffer me, for I was mad with love of her naked flesh.  Then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4274",8778,"she did on this golden gown, and departed when she had given me the old","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4275",8778,"clout aforesaid, and I went away with it, scarce feeling the ground","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4276",8778,"beneath my feet; and I set the dear gown in a fair little coffer, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4277",8778,"here in this castle I have it now, and many times I take it forth and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4278",8778,"kiss it and lay my head upon it.  Now this is a simple tale, lady, and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4279",8778,"am ashamed that I have made it so long for thee.  And yet I know not; for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4280",8778,"thou seemest to me so kind and loving and true, that I am fain that thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4281",8778,"shouldest know how sorely I love thy friend and mine.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4282",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4283",8778,"Birdalone deemed Baudoin a good man indeed, and the tears came into her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4284",8778,"eyes as she answered and said: True is thy tale, dear friend, and I have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4285",8778,"deemed it rather short than long.  I see well that thou art Aurea’s very","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4286",8778,"lover; and it joys me to think that thou, O terrible champion, art yet so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4287",8778,"tender and true.  Now is the golden gown thine, but I will pray thee to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4288",8778,"lend it me a little longer.  But this jewel shalt thou have from my neck","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4289",8778,"here and now; and thou knowest whence it came, thine Aurea’s neck","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4290",8778,"forsooth.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4291",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4292",8778,"Therewith she betook it him, and he held it in his hand doubtfully a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4293",8778,"while, and then he said: Dear maiden, I thank thee, but I will take this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4294",8778,"collar, and lay it in my casket, and be glad thereof; and that the more,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4295",8778,"as, now I look on thee, I see nought missing from the loveliness of thine","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4296",8778,"own neck.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4297",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4298",8778,"Go to thy fellows now, said Birdalone, and send me the Green Knight, the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4299",8778,"goodly lad.  So went he, and presently came Hugh thither merry and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4300",8778,"smiling, and said: Thou hast been long about the first token, sweet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4301",8778,"mistress; I fear me I shall make no such goodly story as hath Baudoin.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4302",8778,"And yet, said she, Viridis’ tale was the longest of all.  I doubt thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4303",8778,"mayst fail in the token.  And she laughed; and he no less, and took her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4304",8778,"by the shoulders, and kissed her cheek frankly, and in such wise that she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4305",8778,"feared him nought, and said: Now that is to pay thee for thy gibe; what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4306",8778,"wouldst thou have of me?  Said Birdalone: I would have thee tell me how","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4307",8778,"it was that Viridis came by the smock with the green boughs aflame, which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4308",8778,"now I bear upon me.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4309",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4310",8778,"Hearken, darling lady, said he: On a day Viridis and I were alone in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4311",8778,"meadow, and so happy, that we might find nought to do save to fall into","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4312",8778,"strife together; and I said it to her, that she loved me not as well as I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4313",8778,"loved her; which, by the way, was no less than a lie, for of all things","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4314",8778,"living she is the most loving, and when we be together she knoweth not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4315",8778,"how to make enough of me.  Well, we fell to wrangling after the manner of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4316",8778,"lovers, till I, having nothing else to say, bade her remember that since","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4317",8778,"we had first come to love each other, I had given her many things, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4318",8778,"she had given me nothing.  Lo, then! my dear, what an ill-conditioned lad","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4319",8778,"was I.  But, little as I meant it, she took it all amiss, and leapt up,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4320",8778,"and fell to running back home over the meadow; thou mayst think how","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4321",8778,"easily I caught up with her, and how little loth she was to be dragged","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4322",8778,"back by the shoulders.  So when we were sitting again under the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4323",8778,"thorn-bush, we had well-nigh done our wrangle; but she unlaced her gown","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4324",8778,"and drew down a corner thereof, to show me her shoulder, how I had hurt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4325",8778,"it e’en now; and forsooth some little mark there was on the rose-leaf","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4326",8778,"skin; and that made good time for kissing again, as ye may well wot.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4327",8778,"Then she said unto me: And how may I, a poor damsel, give thee gifts, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4328",8778,"my kindred all greedy about me?  Yet would I give thee a gift, such as I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4329",8778,"may, if I but knew what thou wouldst take.  Now my heart was afire with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4330",8778,"that kissing of her shoulder, and I said that I would have that very same","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4331",8778,"smock from her body, which then she bore, and that thereof I should deem","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4332",8778,"that I had a rich gift indeed.  What! said she, and wouldst thou have it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4333",8778,"here and now?  And indeed I think she would have done it off her that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4334",8778,"minute had I pressed her, but I lacked the boldness thereto; and I said:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4335",8778,"Nay, but would she bring it unto me the next time we met; and forsooth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4336",8778,"she brought it folded in a piece of green silk, and dearly have I loved","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4337",8778,"it and kissed it sithence.  But as for thy smock, I had it fairly wrought","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4338",8778,"and embroidered with the flaming green branches, as thou seest it, and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4339",8778,"gave it to her; but not on the day when she gave me the gift; for the new","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4340",8778,"one was long about doing.  Now this is all the tale, and how Viridis","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4341",8778,"might eke it into a long one, I wot not.  But let it be, and tell me,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4342",8778,"have I won thy smock, or lost it?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4343",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4344",8778,"Birdalone laughed on him and said: Well, at least thou shalt have it as a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4345",8778,"gift; and thou mayst call it given either by Viridis or me, which thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4346",8778,"wilt.  But with it goes another gift; which thou mayst have at once since","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4347",8778,"thou must lend me the smock a little longer.  And therewith she betook","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4348",8778,"him her girdle, and he kissed it, but said: Nay, fair lady, this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4349",8778,"befitteth well the loveliness of thy body that thou shouldst wear it; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4350",8778,"well it befitteth the truth and love of thy soul toward it for me; I pray","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4351",8778,"thee to keep it.  Nevertheless, she said, I will not have it, for it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4352",8778,"goeth with mine errand that thou take it of me.  Now I bid thee depart,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4353",8778,"and send hither thy fellow, the Black Squire.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4354",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4355",8778,"Went he then, and anon comes the Black Squire, and now that he was alone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4356",8778,"with Birdalone this first time, he seemed moody and downcast, all unlike","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4357",8778,"the two others.  He stood a little aloof from Birdalone, and said: What","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4358",8778,"wouldst thou ask of me?  Her heart was somewhat chilled by his moodiness,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4359",8778,"for erst had she deemed him the kindest of the three; but she said: It is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4360",8778,"of mine errand to ask of thee concerning this foot-gear which Atra lent","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4361",8778,"me until I give it unto thee, if thou be verily her lover.  Said he: I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4362",8778,"was verily her lover.  Birdalone said: Then canst thou tell me the manner","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4363",8778,"of thy giving these fair shoon unto Atra?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4364",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4365",8778,"He said: Even so; we were walking together in this country-side and came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4366",8778,"to a ford of the river, and it was somewhat deep and took me to over the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4367",8778,"knee, so I bore her over in my arms; then we went on a little further","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4368",8778,"till we must cross the river back again in another place, and there the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4369",8778,"ford was shallower, and, the day being hot, Atra must needs wade it on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4370",8778,"her own feet.  So she did off hosen and shoon, and I led her by the hand,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4371",8778,"and it took her but up to mid-leg.  But when we came up out of the water","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4372",8778,"and were on the grass again, I craved the gift of her foot-gear for the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4373",8778,"love of her, and she gave it straightway, and fared home barefoot, for it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4374",8778,"was over the meads we were wending in early summer, and the grass was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4375",8778,"thick and soft.  But thereafter I did do make the fair shoon which thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4376",8778,"hast on thy feet, and gave them to her.  And, for a further token that my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4377",8778,"tale is true, I shall tell thee that the name of the first ford we waded","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4378",8778,"that day is the Grey-nag’s Wade, and the second is called Goat Ford.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4379",8778,"This is all my tale, lady; is the token true?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4380",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4381",8778,"True it is, squire, said Birdalone, and was silent awhile, and he also.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4382",8778,"Then she looked on him friendly, and said: Thou art out of heart as now,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4383",8778,"my friend.  Fear not, for thou shalt without doubt see thy speech-friend","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4384",8778,"again.  Moreover here is a ring which she set upon my finger, bidding me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4385",8778,"give it thee.  And she held it out unto him.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4386",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4387",8778,"He took the ring, and said: Yea, it is best that I have it of thee, lest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4388",8778,"unluck come thereof.  She saw trouble in his face, but knew not what to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4389",8778,"say to cheer him, and they stood silently facing one another for awhile.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4390",8778,"Then he said: Let us back to our fellows, and talk it over, what is now","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4391",8778,"to be done.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4392",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4393",8778,"So they went their ways to where lay the other two upon the green grass,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4394",8778,"and the Black Squire lay down beside them; but Birdalone stood before","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4411",8778,"cause why we builded this castle on the water’s edge, on the very stead","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4412",8778,"where was raised the pavilion, the house made for the ladies to abide","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4416",8778,"seafaring, that when we were come so far out into the water as to lose","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4417",8778,"sight of land, came upon us mist, rose against us dusk and darkness; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"4426",8778,"mine own self?  And therewith she told them of the Sending Boat, what it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"4427",8778,"was, and how she had come all the way by means thereof from the Isle of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5544",8778,"In a while she drew off shoon and hosen, and stood in the shallow ripple,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5545",8778,"and bathed her hands and face withal, and stooped up-stream and drank","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5546",8778,"from the hollow of her hands, and so stepped ashore and was waxen","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5547",8778,"hardier; then she strung her bow and looked to the shafts in her quiver,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5548",8778,"and did on her foot-gear, and mounted once more, and so rode a brisk","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5549",8778,"amble right on into the dale, and was soon come amongst the Greywethers;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5550",8778,"and she saw that they were a many, and that all the bottom of the dale","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5551",8778,"was besprinkled with them on either side of the stream, and some stood in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5552",8778,"the very stream itself, the ground whereof was black even as the rest of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5556",8778,"way up it, for it winded much, and at first away from her left hand, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5557",8778,"the sides of it went up in somewhat steep screes on either side, which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5558",8778,"were topped with mere upright staves and burgs of black rock; and these","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5559",8778,"were specially big and outthrusting on the right hand of her; and but a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5560",8778,"furlong ahead of where she was, one of these burgs thrust out past the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5561",8778,"scree and came down sheer into the dale, and straitened it so much that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5562",8778,"there was but little way save by the stream itself, which ran swift","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5563",8778,"indeed, but not deep, even there where it was straitened by the sheer","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5565",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5566",8778,"But up the dale would she go, whatever was before her; and now she told","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5567",8778,"herself her very purpose, as forsooth she scarce had heretofore; to wit,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5568",8778,"that she would abide in the dale the night over and see what should","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5569",8778,"betide, and if those wights should chance to come alive, then she looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5570",8778,"to have valiance enough to face them and crave the fulfilment of her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5572",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5573",8778,"So she took the water and rode the stream till she was past the said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5575",8778,"than it was in the beginning; and here again were the Greywethers grown","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5576",8778,"many more and closer together, and, as she deemed, were set in rings","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5577",8778,"round about one very big one, which, forsooth, was somewhat in the shape","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5581",8778,"on to the grass, and rode straight to the said big stone, and there","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5582",8778,"lighted down from off her horse again, and stood by the stone and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5583",8778,"pondered.  Presently she deemed that she saw something dark moving just","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5584",8778,"beyond the stone, but if it were so, it was gone in a twinkling;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5585",8778,"nevertheless she stood affrighted, and stared before her long, and saw no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5588",8778,"At last her courage came again, and she thought: Yet how if this great","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5589",8778,"chieftain be inwardly stirring and will come awake?  Shall I say the word","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5590",8778,"now, lest hereafter it be of no avail?  Therewith she stretched out her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5591",8778,"right hand and laid it on the stone, and spake aloud: O Earth, thou and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5592",8778,"thy first children, I crave of you that he may come back now at once and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5593",8778,"loving me.  And her voice sounded strange and unkent to her in that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5610",8778,"that the man was of the sons of Adam; but what with her shame that was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5611",8778,"now, and her fear that had been, she yet had no might to move, but stood","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5612",8778,"there pale and trembling like a leaf, and might scarce keep her feet.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5613",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5617",8778,"little aloof I could see that nought which might befall could ever make","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5621",8778,"again, and thy fear is gone.  And as for me, thou hast not fled away from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5637",8778,"fashion; dark-haired, with long hazel eyes, smooth-cheeked and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5638",8778,"bright-skinned; his nose long, and a little bent over at the end, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5639",8778,"coming down close to his lips, which were full and red; his face was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5640",8778,"hairless save for a little lip-beard.  He was so clad, that he had no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5641",8778,"helm on his head, but a little hat with a broad gold piece in the front","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5653",8778,"thou, by All-hallows! not utterly unarmed, thou mayst well go up the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5661",8778,"she turned to get to her palfrey, but sore trembling the while; but he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5662",8778,"followed her and said, with brow somewhat knitted: Nay, lady, I have left","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5663",8778,"my horse somewhat further up, and I must go back to fetch him, that we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5664",8778,"may wend out of the dale together.  For I will not suffer thee to flee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5667",8778,"honey and cream and roses.  Therefore if thou go out of the dale, I shall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5668",8778,"go with thee afoot, leading thine horse.  And look to it if it be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5669",8778,"courteous to unhorse a knight, who is ready to be thy servant.  Moreover,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5672",8778,"forsooth, and belike thou shalt never seek thither again.  Wherefore I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5723",8778,"voice was clear and good, and Birdalone’s wrath ran off her, and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5724",8778,"hearkened his tale, and even asked him a question here and there; and so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5725",8778,"courteous was this Black Knight now become, that Birdalone began to think","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5726",8778,"that she had fallen short of courtesy to him, because of her fear and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5727",8778,"weariness of the waiting which so oppressed her; and that shamed and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5728",8778,"irked her, for she would fain be of all courtesy.  Wherefore now she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5729",8778,"deemed that perchance she had erred in deeming him an evil man; and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5730",8778,"looked on him from time to time, and deemed him goodly of fashion; she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5731",8778,"thought his eyes were deep, and his face sober and fair of aspect, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5732",8778,"that his nose turned down at the end, and was over thin at the bridge,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5733",8778,"and moreover his lips looked over-sweet and licorous.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5734",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5735",8778,"Now when the knight was silent of his tales, Birdalone fell to asking him","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5736",8778,"questions sweetly concerning this Stony People which was all about them;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5737",8778,"and he told her all he knew, soberly enough at first, yet indeed ended by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5738",8778,"mocking them somewhat, but mocked not at her any more.  At last he said:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5739",8778,"Fair lady, that thou hast not come here all for nought I partly know by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5740",8778,"those words which I heard come from thy mouth at the King’s Stone;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5741",8778,"wherefore I marvelled indeed when I heard thee say that thou wouldst go","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5742",8778,"straight out of the dale; for I had deemed thee desirous of trying the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5743",8778,"adventure of waking this Stony People a-night-tide.  Forsooth was this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5744",8778,"thy mind when thou soughtest hither to the dale?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5745",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5746",8778,"She reddened at his word, and yeasaid him shortly.  Then said he: Is it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5747",8778,"not thy mind still?  Sir, said she, as now I have got to fear it.  Yea?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5748",8778,"and that is strange, said he, for thou wouldst have waked the dale alone;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5749",8778,"and now thou art no longer alone, but hast me to watch and ward thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5750",8778,"waking, thou art more afeard.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5751",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5752",8778,"She looked on his face steadily, to wot if there were no half-hidden","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5753",8778,"smile therein; but herseemed that he spake in all soberness; and she had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5754",8778,"nought to say to him save this: Sir, I am now become afraid of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5755",8778,"waking.  And he said no more thereof.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5756",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5758",8778,"the knight was minished, some three hours up the dale, and still were the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5759",8778,"Greywethers everywhere about them, so that there were well-nigh as many","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5763",8778,"burgs and the rocks were before them all round it as a wall, though yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5764",8778,"about a mile aloof at the further end; and this end it was wider than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5766",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5767",8778,"Came they then to a level space of greensward clear of the grey stones,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5768",8778,"which were drawn all around it in ordered rings, so that it was as some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5769",8778,"doom-ring of an ancient people; and within the said space Birdalone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5770",8778,"beheld a great black horse tethered and cropping the grass.  The knight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5771",8778,"led her into the ring, and said: Now are we come home for the present, my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5772",8778,"lady, and if it please thee to light down we shall presently eat and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5773",8778,"drink, and sithence talk a little.  And he drew nigh to help her off her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5774",8778,"horse, but she suffered him not, and lighted down of herself; but if she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5775",8778,"suffered not his hand, his eyes she must needs suffer, as he gazed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5781",8778,"under the nighest of the stones he drew forth a pair of saddle-bags, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5782",8778,"took victual and wine thence, and they ate and drank together like old","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5800",8778,"Birdalone gazed down on the ground a while; then she lifted up her head","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5801",8778,"and looked on the Black Knight, and said: Sir Knight, we have been","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5802",8778,"brought so close together to-day, and as meseemeth I am so wholly in thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5803",8778,"power, that I will tell thee the very truth as it is.  My mind it was to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5804",8778,"wake the dale here to-night, and take what might befall me.  And well","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5805",8778,"indeed might I fear the adventure, which few, meseemeth, would not fear.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5806",8778,"But so strong is my longing for that which I would crave of these wights,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5807",8778,"that it overmastered my fear, and my purpose held when I entered the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5811",8778,"heedful of my poor body, and wouldst have it for thine own if thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5812",8778,"mightest.  And there is this in thee also, as I deem, though thou thyself","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5813",8778,"mayst not know it, that thou wouldst have thy pleasure of me whether it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5814",8778,"pleasure me or grieve me; and this thy pleasure must I needs gainsay; for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5815",8778,"though thou mayest hereafter become my friend, yet are there other","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5816",8778,"friends of mine, who be such, that my grief would mar any pleasure they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5817",8778,"might have.  Hast thou heard and understood?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5822",8778,"beside these shot-weapons, I have a thing here in my girdle that may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5823",8778,"serve either against thee or against me, if need drive me thereto;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5824",8778,"wherefore I will pray thee to forbear.  Forsooth, thou shalt presently","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5829",8778,"liest, my lady.  But for the rest, I see that it must all be as thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5830",8778,"wiliest.  Yea, if such be thy will, we shall presently to horse and ride","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5831",8778,"down the dale again, and at the end thereof I shall leave thee to go home","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5832",8778,"alone at thy will.  She said: For that I can thee thanks with all my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5834",8778,"would go home?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5835",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5836",8778,"Again he laughed and said: Because I know already.  I have had more than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5837",8778,"two or three tales from them who have seen thee, or spoken unto others","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5840",8778,"I set eyes on thy beauty, I knew that the said pearl could be nowhere","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5842",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5843",8778,"Let that pass, she said, and blushed not; but now tell me the truth as I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5844",8778,"have told thee, why thou art so instant with me to wake the Greywethers","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5850",8778,"waking, as erst I said.  I say I wish thee to have fulfilment of thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5851",8778,"craving.  Nor hast thou aught to fear of them, seeing that it is but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5860",8778,"said: I shall now tell thee that I shall abide the adventure of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5861",8778,"waking to-night, whatever befall.  And I, said he, will so do that thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5862",8778,"mayst fear me the less; for I will unarm me when the night cometh, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5869",8778,"nightfall: she went without the two first rings of the Greywethers, which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5870",8778,"were set in more open order beyond that, and she looked all about her, to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5871",8778,"the black rocks on either side, and to the great black wall at the dale’s","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5872",8778,"ending, and the blue mountains aloof beyond it; then down toward the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5873",8778,"plain of the dale came her eyes, and she looked through the tangle of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5874",8778,"grey stones.  Now she seemed to be looking more intently upon some one","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5875",8778,"thing; with that she called to her the Black Knight, who was hanging","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5876",8778,"about watching her, and she said to him: Fair sir, art thou clear-seeing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5877",8778,"and far-seeing?  I am not thought to be purblind, quoth he.  Then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5882",8778,"and thou mayst see what I see, and then tell me what it means.  Though","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5905",8778,"saddle, and followed him, for he was mounted in a twinkling, and riding","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5906",8778,"on.  He led out of the ring, and fell to threading the maze of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5907",8778,"Greywethers, keeping ever toward the steep side of the dale, which was on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5911",8778,"sir, why wend we not down the dale?  He answered: First, lady, because we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5912",8778,"must hide us from them straightway; and next because they be more than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5947",8778,"that there it went down sheer to the plain thereof, and that before them","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5948",8778,"was a cleft that narrowed speedily, and over which the rocks well-nigh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5949",8778,"met, so that it was indeed almost a cave.  They rode into it straightway,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5950",8778,"and when that they had gone but a little, and because it had winded","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5951",8778,"somewhat, they could but see the main valley as a star of light behind","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5952",8778,"them, then it narrowed no more, but was as a dismal street of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5953",8778,"straitest, whiles lighter and whiles darker, according as the rocks","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5954",8778,"roofed it in overhead or drew away from it.  Long they rode, and whiles","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5955",8778,"came trickles of water from out the rocks on one hand or the other; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5956",8778,"now and again they met a stream which covered all the ground of the pass","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5957",8778,"from side to side for the depth of a foot or more.  Great rocks also were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5958",8778,"strewn over their path every here and there, so that whiles must they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5961",8778,"Birdalone, save to tell her of the way, and warn her where it was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5962",8778,"perilous; and she, for her part, was silent, partly for fear of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5963",8778,"strange man, or, it might be, even for hatred of him, who had thus","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5964",8778,"brought her into such sore trouble, and partly for grief.  For, with all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5965",8778,"torment of sorrow, she kept turning over and over in her mind whether her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5966",8778,"friends had yet come home to the Castle of the Quest, and whether they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5967",8778,"would go seek her to deliver her.  And such shame took hold of her when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5968",8778,"she thought of their grief and confusion of soul when they should come","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5969",8778,"home and find her gone, that she set her mind to asking if it had not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"5979",8778,"hours, and it had long been night in the world without, but moon-lit, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5980",8778,"they had rested but seldom, and then but for short whiles, the knight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5981",8778,"drew rein and spake to Birdalone, and asked her was she not weary.  O","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5982",8778,"yea, she said; I was at point to pray thee suffer me to get off and lie","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5983",8778,"down on the bare rock.  To say sooth, I am now too weary to think of any","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5984",8778,"peril, or what thou art, or whither we be going.  He said: By my deeming","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5985",8778,"we be now half through this mountain highway, and belike there is little","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5986",8778,"peril in our resting; for I think not that any one of them knoweth of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5987",8778,"this pass, or would dare it if he did; and they doubtless came into the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5988",8778,"dale by the upper pass, which is strait enough, but light and open.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5989",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5990",8778,"As he spoke, Birdalone bowed forward on her horse’s neck, and would have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5991",8778,"fallen but that he stayed her.  Then he lifted her off her horse, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5992",8778,"laid her down in the seemliest place he might find; and the pass there","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5993",8778,"was much widened, and such light as there was in the outer world came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5994",8778,"down freely into it, though it were but of the moon and the stars; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5995",8778,"the ground was rather sandy than rocky.  So he dight Birdalone’s bed as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5996",8778,"well as he might, and did off his surcoat and laid it over her; and then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"5997",8778,"stood aloof, and gazed on her; and he muttered: It is an evil chance; yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6011",8778,"gave her fellow-farer the sele of the day, and he brought her victual,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6040",8778,"Shall I tell thee the truth, and say that from the first I seemed to see","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6041",8778,"in thee that thou wert scarce trusty?  He said: Well, that mind I saw in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6042",8778,"thee, and it went to my heart that thou shouldest think it, and that it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6043",8778,"should be no less than true.  But now I must tell thee, that it is for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6044",8778,"thy sake that I have been untrusty to my lord.  How so? said she.  Quoth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6045",8778,"he: Heardest thou ever of the Red Knight?  Yea, said Birdalone, I have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6046",8778,"heard of him ever as a tyrant and oppressor.  Then she grew pale, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6047",8778,"said: Art thou he?  Nay, said the knight, I am but a kinsman of his, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6048",8778,"his best-trusted man; nor have I failed him ever till yesterday.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6049",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6050",8778,"He kept silence a while, and then said: This is the true tale: that we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6051",8778,"have had tidings of thee and of thy ridings abroad with that old fool,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6052",8778,"Sir Aymeris, and how thou hadst been twice to look into the Black Valley.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6053",8778,"This I say hath the Red One heard, and the heart of him was touched by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6054",8778,"the mere hearsay of thee; and moreover ’tis blessed bread to him the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6055",8778,"doing of any grief to the knights of Quest Castle; wherefore he hath sent","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6056",8778,"me to hang about the dale, to lay hands on thee if I might for; he knew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6057",8778,"being wise, that thou wouldst hanker after it; and moreover he let one of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6058",8778,"his wise women sit out in spells on thee.  So I espied, and happened on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6059",8778,"thee all alone; and mine errand it was, since I came upon thee thus, to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6060",8778,"draw thee till I had thee safe at home in the Red Hold.  Forsooth I began","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6062",8778,"have seen the traitor in me.  But then, and then my heart failed me,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6063",8778,"because I fell, not to desiring thee as coveting my master’s chattel, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6064",8778,"to loving thee and longing for thee as my fellow and speech-friend.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6070",8778,"that upper pass whereof I told thee; they were of our men; I brought","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6080",8778,"held my tongue, deeming that it might one day serve my turn; as it hath","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6085",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6086",8778,"Whither then? said Birdalone; tell me, that I may at least trust thee,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6087",8778,"even though I owe thee for all the pain and grief which thou hast wrought","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6088",8778,"me.  He reddened and said: Wait a while; I bring thee to no ill place;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6089",8778,"there shall no harm befall thee.  And he fretted and fumed, and was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6090",8778,"confused of speech and look, and then he said: When we come there I shall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6092",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6093",8778,"O, but I crave a boon of thee here and now, said Birdalone.  Wipe away","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6095",8778,"Quest!  So mayst thou yet be dear unto me, though maybe not wholly as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6096",8778,"thou wouldst have it.  And she reached out her two hands toward him.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6097",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6098",8778,"His breast heaved, and he seemed nigh to weeping; but he said: Nay, lady,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6099",8778,"ask me not here and now, but there and to-morrow.  But again I swear to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6100",8778,"thee by thine hands that to the Red Hold I will not bring thee, nor","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6101",8778,"suffer thee to be brought, if I may hinder it; nay, not though I give my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6103",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6104",8778,"Birdalone was silent awhile; then she said: And what shall befall me if I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6105",8778,"come to the Red Hold?  What is the Red Knight, and what would he do with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6106",8778,"me?  Said he: The Red Knight is terrible and fierce and wise; and I fear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6107",8778,"him, I.  He held his peace, and said: I must needs say it, that to thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6108",8778,"he would have been as Death and the Devil.  He would have bedded thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6109",8778,"first.  She broke in: Nay, never! and flushed very red.  But the knight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6110",8778,"went on: And after, I wot not; that were according to his mood.  And as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6112",8778,"hath about him.  Such as thou? she said angrily.  Nay, he said, far worse","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6113",8778,"than me; men who fare little afield, and are not sweetened by adventures","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6114",8778,"and war-perils; and women worser yet; and far worser were they dealing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6115",8778,"with a woman.  She was silent again awhile, and paled once more; then her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6116",8778,"colour came back to her, and she held out her hand to him and said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6117",8778,"kindly: Thou being what thou art, I thank thee for thy dealings with me;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6118",8778,"and now until to-morrow, when I shall ask thee of that again, I am","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6137",8778,"saw no daylight between the trunks for well-nigh an hour, whereas the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6145",8778,"kindly to him, and therewith they rode on to open ground, and were on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6146",8778,"side of a steep bent, broken on their right hands into a sheer cliff as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6147",8778,"Birdalone saw when the knight led her to the edge and bade her look over.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6148",8778,"Then she saw down into a fair dale lying far below them, through the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6149",8778,"which ran a little river, clear and swift, but not riotous, after it had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6150",8778,"fallen over a force at the upper end of the dale, and made the sound of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6151",8778,"water which she had heard.  The said dale was so, that whatsoever was on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6152",8778,"the other side thereof was hidden by tall and great trees, that stood","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6153",8778,"close together some twenty yards aloof from the stream, and betwixt them","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6154",8778,"and it was fair greensward with a few bushes and thorn-trees thereon.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6155",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6156",8778,"Quoth the knight: Down there shall we rest till to-morrow, if it please","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6158",8778,"way at once.  It pleases me well, said Birdalone, and I long to tread the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6163",8778,"it to an end, and had met the river as it swept round the cliff-wall of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6165",8778,"greensward aforesaid under the trees; and in a bight of the wood was a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6166",8778,"bower builded of turf and thatched with reed; and there, by the bidding","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6167",8778,"of the knight, they alighted; and the knight said: This is thine house","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6168",8778,"for to-night, my lady; and thou mayest lie there in all safety after thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6169",8778,"hast supped, and mayst have my weapons by thy side if thou wilt, while I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6171",8778,"water, to comfort thee after the long ride and the weariness, I swear by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6176",8778,"ward unarmed; keep thou thy weapons; and thou wilt not forget, perchance,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6177",8778,"that I am not wholly unarmed, whereas I have my bow and arrows and my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6178",8778,"knife here.  And as to my bathing, I will take thee at thy word, and bid","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6179",8778,"thee go aloof a while now at once; for I will go down to the water; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6180",8778,"if thou spy upon me, then will it be thy shame and not mine.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6182",8778,"The knight went his ways therewith, and Birdalone went down to the water","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6184",8778,"three shafts on the lip thereof.  Then she took the water, and disported","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6185",8778,"her merrily therein; and now, forsooth, she was nowise downcast, for she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6186",8778,"said to herself, this man is not all evil and he lovest me well, and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6187",8778,"look for it that to-morrow he will bring me on my way toward the Castle","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6188",8778,"of the Quest, for mere love of me; and then shall he be a dear friend to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6189",8778,"me, and I will comfort him what I can for as long as we both live.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6190",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6191",8778,"So she came out of the water and clad her, and then called aloud for the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6192",8778,"knight, and he came speedily unto her, as if he had been not exceeding","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6193",8778,"far away, though he swore with a great oath that he had nowise espied","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6194",8778,"her.  She answered him nought, and they went side by side to the bower;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6195",8778,"and there the knight dight the victual, and they sat together and ate","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6196",8778,"their meat like old friends; and Birdalone asked the knight concerning","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6197",8778,"this valley and the bower, if he had known it for long, and he answered:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6198",8778,"Yea, lady, I was but a stripling when I first happened on the dale; and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6199",8778,"deem that few know thereof save me; at least none of our flock knoweth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6200",8778,"thereof, and I am fain thereof, and keep them unknowing, for if my lord","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6201",8778,"were to hear of my having a haunt privy unto me he would like it but ill.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6202",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6203",8778,"Birdalone turned pale when she heard him speak of his lord; for fear of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6204",8778,"the Red Knight had entered into her soul, so that now the flesh crept","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6205",8778,"upon her bones.  But she enforced her to smile, and said: Yea, and what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6206",8778,"would he do to thee were he ill-content with thy ways?  Forsooth, lady,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6207",8778,"said he, if he could spare me he would make an end of me in some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6208",8778,"miserable way; nay, if he were exceeding ill-content, he would do as much","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6209",8778,"for me whether he could spare me or not; otherwise he would watch his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6210",8778,"occasion, and so grieve me that what he did would go to my very heart.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6211",8778,"Woe’s me! said Birdalone, thou servest an evil master.  The knight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6212",8778,"answered not, and Birdalone went on speaking earnestly: It is a shame to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6213",8778,"thee to follow this fiend; why dost thou not sunder thee from him, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6214",8778,"become wholly an honest man?  Said he gruffly: It is of no use talking of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6215",8778,"this, I may not; to boot, I fear him.  Then did Birdalone hold her peace,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6216",8778,"and the knight said: Thou dost not know; when I part from thee I must","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6217",8778,"needs go straight to him, and then must that befall which will befall.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6218",8778,"Speak we no more of these matters.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6219",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6220",8778,"Birdalone flushed with hope and joy as he spake thus, for she took him to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6221",8778,"mean that he would lead her, on the morrow, on her way to the Castle of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6222",8778,"the Quest.  But the knight spake in a voice grown cheerful again: As to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6223",8778,"this bower, lady, the tale thereof is soon told; for with mine own hands","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6224",8778,"I builded it some fifteen years ago; and I have come to this place time","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6225",8778,"and again when my heart was overmuch oppressed with black burdens of evil","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6226",8778,"and turmoil, and have whiles prevailed against the evil, and whiles not.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6227",8778,"Mayst thou prevail this time, then! said she.  He answered her not, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6228",8778,"presently fell to talking with her of other matters, and the two were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6229",8778,"frank and friendly together, till the August night grew dark about them;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6230",8778,"and then spake Birdalone: Now would I rest, for I can no longer keep mine","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6231",8778,"eyes open.  Abide aloof from me to-morrow morning till I call to thee, as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6232",8778,"thou didst this evening; and then, before we eat together again, thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6233",8778,"shalt tell me what thou wilt do with me.  He stood up to depart, and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6234",8778,"reached out her hand to him in the glimmer, and he saw it, but said: Nay,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6235",8778,"if I take thine hand, I shall take thine whole body.  And therewith he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6236",8778,"departed, and she laid her down in her smock alone, and slept anon, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6254",8778,"was not hasty to answer her, and she spake again: This must thou do, or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6255",8778,"else take me to the Red Hold and deliver me to the tyrant there; and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6320",8778,"stooped to him, and touched his shoulder and said: Rise up, I bid thee,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6336",8778,"friend while both we live.  And now, if thou canst, be a little merrier,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6337",8778,"and come and sit with me, and let us eat our meat, for I hunger.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6338",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6339",8778,"He smiled, but woefully, and presently they sat down to their meat; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6343",8778,"she heeded it nought, and was blithe and debonair with him.  And when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6344",8778,"they had done their meat he sat looking at her a while, and at last he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6345",8778,"said: Lady, dost thou deem that, when all is said, I have done somewhat","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6346",8778,"for thee since first we met the day before yesterday at the lower end of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6347",8778,"the Black Valley?  Yea, she said, as erst I spake, all things considered","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6348",8778,"I deem that thou hast done much.  And now, said he, I am to do more yet;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6349",8778,"for I am to lead thee to where henceforth I shall have no more part or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6350",8778,"lot in thee than if thou wert in heaven and I in hell.  I pray thee say","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6351",8778,"not so, said Birdalone; have I not said that I will be thy friend?  Lady,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6352",8778,"said the knight, I wot well that according to the sweetness of thine","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6353",8778,"heart wilt thou do what thou canst do.  And therewith he was silent a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6358",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6359",8778,"Lady, he said, I will ask this as a reward of the way-leader, to wit,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6360",8778,"that thou abide with me here in this dale, in all honour holden, till","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6361",8778,"to-morrow morning; and let this place, which has helped me aforetime, be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6362",8778,"hallowed by thy dwelling here; and I, I shall have had one happy day at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6363",8778,"least, if never another.  Canst thou grant me this?  If thou canst not,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6364",8778,"we will depart in an hour.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6365",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6366",8778,"Her countenance fell at his word, and she was silent a while; for sore","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6367",8778,"she longed to be speedily whereas her friends should find her if they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6368",8778,"came back to the castle.  But she thought within herself how wild and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6369",8778,"fierce the man was, and doubted if he might not go stark mad on her hands","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6370",8778,"and destroy her if she thwarted overmuch; and, moreover, frankly she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6371",8778,"pitied him, and would do what she might to ease his pain and solace his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6372",8778,"grief of heart.  Wherefore she cleared her face of its trouble and let it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6373",8778,"be vexed no longer, but smiled upon the knight and said: Fair sir, this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6374",8778,"meseemeth but a little thing for me to do, and I grant it thee with a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6375",8778,"good will, and this shall now be the first day of the friendship if so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6376",8778,"thou wilt take it; and may it solace thee.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6377",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6378",8778,"Who then was gleeful but the knight, and strange it was to see all his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6379",8778,"sorrow run off him; and he became glad and gamesome as a youth, and yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6380",8778,"withal exceeding courteous and kind with her, as though he were serving a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6382",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6383",8778,"So then they wore the day together in all good fellowship; and first they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6384",8778,"went up the dale together and right to the foot of that great force,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6385",8778,"where the stream came thundering down from the sheer rocks; and long","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6386",8778,"Birdalone stood to look thereon, and much she marvelled at it, for no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6387",8778,"such thing had she seen before.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6388",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6389",8778,"Thereafter they went afoot into the wood behind the green bower, and when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6390",8778,"they had gone some way therein for their pleasure, they fell to seeking","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6391",8778,"venison for their dinner; and the knight took Birdalone’s bow and shafts","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6392",8778,"to strike the quarry withal, but he would have her gird his sword to her,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6393",8778,"that she might not be weaponless.  So they gat them a roe and came back","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6394",8778,"therewith to the bower, and the knight dight it and cooked it, and again","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6395",8778,"they ate in fellowship and kindness; and Birdalone had been to the river","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6396",8778,"and fetched thence store of blue-flowered mouse-ear, and of meadow-sweet,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6397",8778,"whereof was still some left from the early days of summer, and had made","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6398",8778,"her garlands for her head and her loins; and the knight sat and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6399",8778,"worshipped her, yet he would not so much as touch her hand, sorely as he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6400",8778,"hungered for the beauty of her body.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6401",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6402",8778,"Next, when dinner was done, and they lay in the shadow of the trees, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6403",8778,"hearkened the moor-hen crying from the water, and the moaning of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6404",8778,"wood-doves in the high trees, she turned to him and bade him tell her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6405",8778,"somewhat of the tale of his life and deeds; but he said: Nay, lady, I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6406",8778,"pray thee pardon me, for little have I to tell thee that is good, and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6407",8778,"would not have thee know of me aught worse than thou knowest of me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6408",8778,"already.  Rather be thou kind to me, and tell me of thy days that have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6409",8778,"been, wherein I know full surely shall be nought but good.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6410",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6411",8778,"She smiled and blushed, but without more ado fell to telling him of her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6412",8778,"life in the House under the Wood, and spared not even to tell him","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6413",8778,"somewhat of the wood-mother.  And he said no word to her thereover, save","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6414",8778,"thanks and praises for the kindness of her story.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6415",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6416",8778,"At last the day wore to its ending, and then the knight’s grief strode","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6417",8778,"over him again, and he was moody and few-spoken; and Birdalone was blithe","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6418",8778,"with him still, and would have solaced his grief; but he said: Let it be;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6419",8778,"as for thee, thou shalt be happy to-morrow, but this happy day of mine is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6420",8778,"well-nigh worn, and it is as the wearing of my life.  And the dark night","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6421",8778,"came, and he bade her good-night sorrowfully, and departed to his lair in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6422",8778,"the wood.  Birdalone lay in the bower, and might not sleep a long while","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6423",8778,"for her joy of the morrow, which should bring her back to the Castle of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6424",8778,"the Quest.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6425",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6426",8778,"But when morning was, and the sun was but just risen, Birdalone awoke,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6427",8778,"and stood up and did on her raiment, and called her servant the knight,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6428",8778,"and he came at once leading the two horses, and said: Now go we to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6429",8778,"Castle of the Quest.  And he was sober and sorrowful, but nought fierce","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6431",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6432",8778,"So Birdalone thanked him kindly and praised him, and he changed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6434",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6461",8778,"bower in the copse, he went home to the castle sadly enough, because of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6462",8778,"his love and longing for her, which well he wotted might never be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6463",8778,"satisfied.  Moreover when he was come into the castle again, there fell","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6464",8778,"fear upon him for what might betide her, and he rued it that he had done","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6465",8778,"her will in getting her forth of the castle; and in vain now he set","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6466",8778,"before himself all the reasons for deeming that her peril herein was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6467",8778,"little or nothing, even as he had laid them before her, and which he then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6468",8778,"believed in utterly, whereas now himseemed there was an answer to every","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6469",8778,"one of them.  So he sighed heavily and went into the chapel, wherein was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6470",8778,"an altar of St. Leonard; and he knelt thereat, and prayed the saint, as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6471",8778,"he had erst delivered folk from captivity, now to deliver both him and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6473",8778,"many words, it lightened his heart little or nothing; so that when he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6474",8778,"rose up again, that if anything evil happened to this pearl of women, he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6475",8778,"wished heartily that some one might take his life and he be done with it.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6478",8778,"thinking all things over, he thought he would go straight to Sir Aymeris","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6479",8778,"and make a clean breast of it, so that weaponed men might be sent at once","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6480",8778,"to seek Birdalone.  And he said to himself: What matter if he slay me or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6481",8778,"cast me into prison, if Birdalone be lost?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6482",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6483",8778,"So he went his ways to the highest tower, which looked landward and hight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6484",8778,"the Open Eye, deeming to find Sir Aymeris; but when he got to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6485",8778,"topmost, he found neither captain nor carle there: wherefore he stayed a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6486",8778,"little and looked forth betwixt the battlements, if perchance there were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6487",8778,"some wild chance of seeing Birdalone’s coming home again; but his keen","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6489",8778,"the field-folk of thereabouts.  So he turned away and went by the swale","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6490",8778,"toward the next tallest tower, which looked lakewards, and was called","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6491",8778,"Hearts’ Hope; and as he went he fell to framing in his mind the words","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6492",8778,"which he should say to the castellan.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6493",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6495",8778,"nought small; and there gathered together in a knot, and all gazing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6496",8778,"eagerly out over the lake, he found a dozen of men-at-arms and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6497",8778,"castellan amongst them.  They took no heed of him as he came up, though","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6500",8778,"he had but one thought in his mind, to wit, the rescuing of Birdalone.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6501",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6502",8778,"He went up now behind where the castellan was leaning over the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6503",8778,"battlement, and pulled his skirt, and when Sir Aymeris turned round, he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6504",8778,"said: Lord, I have a word for thine ear.  But the old knight did but half","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6505",8778,"turn round, and then spake peevishly: Tush, man! another time! seest thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6506",8778,"not I have got no eyes for aught save what we see on the lake?  Yea, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6507",8778,"what then? said the priest.  There cometh a boat, said Sir Aymeris, not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6508",8778,"looking back at him, and our thought is that therein be our lords.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6509",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6510",8778,"When the priest heard that word, it was to him as if hell had opened","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6511",8778,"underneath his feet; and he had no might to speak for a minute; then he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6512",8778,"cried out: Sir Aymeris, hearken, I pray thee.  But the old knight but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6513",8778,"thrust him back with his hand, and even therewith one of the men-at-arms","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6514",8778,"cried out: I hear the voice of their horn!  Then shouted Sir Aymeris:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6515",8778,"Where art thou, Noise?  Blow, man, blow, if ever thou blewest in all thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6516",8778,"life!  And therewithal came the blare of the brass, and Sir Aymeris","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6517",8778,"nodded to the trumpeter, who blew blast after blast with all his might,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6518",8778,"so that the priest might as well have been dumb for any hearing he might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6519",8778,"get; and all the while to Leonard the minutes seemed hours, and he was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6520",8778,"well-nigh distraught.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6521",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6522",8778,"And then when the knight held up his hand for the Noise to stay his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6523",8778,"blowing, and Leonard strove to speak, the castellan turned on him and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6525",8778,"with our ears to heed if they answer us?  Not a word any one man of you,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6527",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6528",8778,"Even therewith came clearly the sound of the horn from the water, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6529",8778,"again and yet again; and no man spake but the chaplain, who cried out:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6530",8778,"Hearken, knight, it is of Birdalone.  But Sir Aymeris laid his hand on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6531",8778,"his shoulder and said in an angry whisper: Thou shalt be put downstairs,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6538",8778,"himself yet more, as was but right, for a fool and a licorous traitor.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6543",8778,"refraining them from shoving each his neighbour on to the next one;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6544",8778,"Leonard followed on them, and presently arose great shouting and tumult","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6566",8778,"of all Arthur and Atra, and she alone of the three women looked downcast,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6621",8778,"them but had good will to break his neck; and the same rede had all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6622",8778,"three, that there was nought for it but to go their ways with all speed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6623",8778,"to the Black Valley of the Greywethers, and follow up the slot of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6624",8778,"Birdalone if it might yet be found; wherefore they bade saddle their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6625",8778,"horses straightway; and while that was a-doing they ate a morsel, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6626",8778,"bade farewell to their lovelings.  And they dight them to go, they three","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6627",8778,"together, with but one squire and a sergeant, who were both of them keen","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6628",8778,"trackers and fell woodsmen.  But ere they went, by the rede of Arthur","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6629",8778,"they bade Sir Aymeris to arm a two score of men and ride toward the Red","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6630",8778,"Hold, and beset the ways ’twixt that and the Castle of the Quest; for one","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6631",8778,"and all they deemed that if any harm befell Birdalone, the Red Knight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6632",8778,"would be at the bottom of it.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6633",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6634",8778,"So rode those fellows, and came unto the dale but some four hours after","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6635",8778,"Birdalone had happened on the stranger knight; and they took up the slot","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6636",8778,"of her, but not easily, whereas the ground was hard and stony; howbeit,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6637",8778,"they found tokens of the knight also, finding here and there what they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6638",8778,"deemed the footprints of a tall man.  And this was grievous to those","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6639",8778,"fellows, since now they could not but deem that somewhat untoward had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6640",8778,"befallen Birdalone.  But they went on making out the slot, and they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6641",8778,"followed it with much toil until they came to the doom-ring in the head","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6642",8778,"of the dale, whereas Birdalone and the stranger had sat down to meat; but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6643",8778,"by that time, so toilsome had been their going, it was somewhat more than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6644",8778,"dusk, and there was nought for it but to abide there night-long.  So a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6645",8778,"while they sat talking, all of them, and the squire and the sergeant","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6646",8778,"aforesaid were not a little timorous of the adventure of making that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6647",8778,"stead unkenned their sleeping chamber; and to while away the time, their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6648",8778,"lords made them tell tales such as they knew concerning that place; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6649",8778,"both they said that they had never erst come into the dale but a very","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6650",8778,"little way, and said that they had done so then but trusting in their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6651",8778,"lords’ bidding and the luck of the Quest.  Thereafter turned the talk as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6652",8778,"to what had befallen Birdalone, and the chances of coming on her; and, as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6653",8778,"folk will in such a plight, they talked the matter over and over again","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6654",8778,"till they were weary and could say no more.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6655",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6656",8778,"Then they went to sleep, and nought befell them till they awoke in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6657",8778,"broad daylight; but they had little inkling of what hour it was, for all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6658",8778,"the dale was full of thick white mist that came rolling down from the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6659",8778,"mountains, so that they could scarce see their hands before them, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6660",8778,"there they had to tarry still, would they, would they not; and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6661",8778,"sergeant fell to telling tales of folk who had been lost in that stony","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6662",8778,"maze; and all of them deemed, more or less, that this was the work either","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6663",8778,"of evil wights, or it might be of the wizardry of the Red Knight; and, to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6664",8778,"be short, they all deemed that he it was who had wielded it, save the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6665",8778,"sergeant, who said that the mountain wights were the masters and not the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6666",8778,"servants of him of the Red Hold.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6667",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6668",8778,"Thus, then, it betided; but when the said mist had been hanging upon them","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6669",8778,"for some six hours, it rolled up like a curtain, and lo the blue sky and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6670",8778,"the sun, and the mountains as clear blue as in a picture; and they saw by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6671",8778,"the sun that it was but a little after high noon.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6672",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6673",8778,"But as they rejoiced herein, and betook them once more to tracking out","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6674",8778,"the slot of Birdalone and the other, the sky became suddenly overcast,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6675",8778,"and down from the jaws of the mountain came a storm of wind and rain, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6676",8778,"thunder and lightning, so great that they might scarce see each other’s","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6677",8778,"faces, and when it cleared off, in about an hour and a half, and went","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6678",8778,"down the wind to the south-east, the stream was waxen great, and ran","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6679",8778,"brown and furious down the dale, so that it was fordable only here and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6680",8778,"there; and as for tracking the slot of those twain, there was no need to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6681",8778,"talk thereof, for the fury of the driving rain had washed all away.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6682",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6683",8778,"Thus fared they the whole day betwixt fog and clear weather, and they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6684",8778,"laid them down to rest at night sore disheartened.  When the day broke","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6685",8778,"they talked together as to what was best to do; and the sergeant","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6686",8778,"aforesaid spake: Lords, said he, meseemeth I am more at home in the Black","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6687",8778,"Valley than ye be; heed ye not wherefore.  Now so it is that if we tarry","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6688",8778,"here till night come we wot not what of evil may betide us, or at the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6689",8778,"least we do nought.  Or if we turn back and go southward out of the dale","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6690",8778,"we shall be safe indeed; but safe should we have been at your house,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6691",8778,"lords, and should have done no less.  But now I shall tell you that, if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6692",8778,"ye will, lords, I shall guide you to a pass that goeth out of the head of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6693",8778,"the dale to our right hands, and so turneth the flank of the mountains,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6694",8778,"and cometh out into the country which lieth about the Red Hold; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6695",8778,"meseemeth it is thitherward that we must seek if we would hear any","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6696",8778,"tidings of the lady; for there may we lay in ambush and beset the ways","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6697",8778,"that lead up to the Hold, by which she must have been brought if she hath","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6698",8778,"not been carried through the air.  How say ye, lords?  Soothly there is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6699",8778,"peril therein; yet meseemeth peril no more than in our abiding another","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6701",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6702",8778,"Said Arthur: We heed not the peril if there be aught to be done;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6703",8778,"wherefore let us be stirring straightway.  And so said they all.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6704",8778,"Wherefore they gat to horse, and rode up to the very head of the valley,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6705",8778,"and the weather was now calm and bright.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6706",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6707",8778,"But the sergeant brought them to the pass whereof the stranger knight had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6708",8778,"spoken to Birdalone, which led into the Red Knight’s country, and without","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6709",8778,"more ado they entered it when it was now about three hours after noon.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6710",8778,"But the way was both steep and rough, so that they had much toil, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6711",8778,"went not very far ere night fell upon them, and the moon was not yet up.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6712",8778,"So when they had stumbled on another two hours, and their horses were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6713",8778,"much spent and they themselves not a little weary, they laid them down to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6714",8778,"sleep, after they had eaten such meat as they had with them, in a place","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6715",8778,"where was a little grass for the horses to bite; for all the road","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6716",8778,"hitherto had been mere grim stones and big rocks, walled on either side","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6717",8778,"by stony screes, above which rose steep and beetling crags.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6718",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6719",8778,"In the dawn they arose again, and made no ado till they were in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6720",8778,"saddle, and rode till they came to the crest of the pass, and came out","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6721",8778,"thence after a while on to the swelling flank of a huge mountain (as it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6722",8778,"might be the side of the mountain of Plinlimmon in Wales), which was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6723",8778,"grassed and nought craggy, but utterly treeless.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6725",8778,"Now the sergeant led them somewhat athwart the said mountain till they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6726",8778,"began to go down, and saw below them a country of little hills much","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6727",8778,"covered with wood, and in a while, and ere it was noon, they were among","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"6728",8778,"the said woods, which were grown mostly with big trees, as oak here and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6868",8778,"one thing to do, and that is to get us speedily on our way to the Castle","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6871",8778,"Then they turned to go toward their horses; but therewith Birdalone smote","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"6879",8778,"a hole with the swords and laid the head of the captain of the Red Knight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7054",8778,"bent down as if they were her judges, for so in sooth she deemed them.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7056",8778,"sit amongst you till ye have heard my story, and ye have told me that I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7057",8778,"am yet of your fellowship.  None said aught; Atra looked straight before","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7058",8778,"her, and her eyes met not Birdalone’s eyes; Arthur looked down on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7068",8778,"so that I longed sore to do somewhat which should make me whole again.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7069",8778,"Then weird would that I should hear all the tale of the Black Valley of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7071",8778,"desire; and methought how well it were if I might seek the adventure","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7072",8778,"there and accomplish it.  Thereof, doubtless, hath the chaplain, Sir","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7084",8778,"had been done and said; and freely she told it, without fear or shame,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7085",8778,"and with such clearness and sweetness of words that no one of them","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7086",8778,"doubted her aught; and Arthur lifted up his head, and once and again his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7087",8778,"eyes met hers, and there was nought of hardness in them, though they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7088",8778,"turned away at once.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7092",8778,"the wildwood with their heads turned toward the Castle of the Quest; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7094",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7095",8778,"When we turned into the wood away from the said valley it lacked some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7096",8778,"four hours of noon; and we rode till noon was, and rested by a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7097",8778,"stream-side and ate, for we knew no cause wherefore we should hasten","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7098",8778,"overmuch; but my fellow the strange knight was downcast and heavy, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7099",8778,"some might have called him sullen.  But I strove to make him of better","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7100",8778,"cheer, and spake to him kindly, as to one who of an enemy had become a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7101",8778,"friend; but he answered me: Lady, it availeth not; I grieve that I am no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7102",8778,"better company than thou seest me, and I have striven to be merrier; but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7103",8778,"apart from all that I wot and that thou wottest which should make me of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7104",8778,"evil cheer, there is now a weight upon my heart which I cannot lift, such","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7105",8778,"as never have I felt erst.  So by thy leave we will to horse at once,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7106",8778,"that we may the speedier come to the Castle of the Quest and Sir Aymeris’","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7107",8778,"prison.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7108",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7109",8778,"So I arose, but smiled on him and said: Hold up thine heart, friend! for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7110",8778,"thee shall be no prison at the Castle of the Quest, but the fair welcome","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7111",8778,"of friends.  He said nought, and mended not his cheer; and in this plight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7112",8778,"we gat to horse and rode on for some three hours more, till we came out","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7113",8778,"of the thick forest into a long clearing, which went like a wide highway","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7114",8778,"of greensward between the thicket, and it seemed as if the hand of man","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7115",8778,"had cleared that said green road.  Thereto we had come, following a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7116",8778,"little river which came out on to the clearing with us, and then,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7117",8778,"turning, ran well-nigh amidst it toward the north.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7118",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7119",8778,"Now when we were come thither, and were betwixt the thicket and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7120",8778,"water’s edge, we drew rein, and it seemed to me as fair a stead as might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7121",8778,"be in the woodland, and I looked thereon well pleased and with a happy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7122",8778,"heart.  But the knight said: Lady, art thou not exceeding weary?  Nay,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7123",8778,"said I, not in any wise.  Said he: It is strange then, for so weary am I,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7124",8778,"that I must in any case get off my horse and lay me down on the grass","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7125",8778,"here, or I shall drop from the saddle.  And therewith he lighted down and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7126",8778,"stood by me a little, as to help me off my horse; but I said to him:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7127",8778,"Knight, I pray thee, even if ye be weary, to struggle forward a little,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7128",8778,"lest we be in peril here.  In peril? quoth he; yea, that might be if the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7129",8778,"Red Knight knew of our whereabouts; but how should that be?  He spoke","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7130",8778,"this heavily, as one scarce awake; and then he said: I pray thee pardon","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7131",8778,"me, lady, but for nought may I hold my head up; suffer me to sleep but a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7132",8778,"little, and then will I arise and lead thee straight to thy journey’s","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7133",8778,"end.  Therewithal he laid him down on the grass and was presently asleep,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7134",8778,"and I sat down by him all dismayed.  At first, indeed, I doubted some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7135",8778,"treachery in him, for how might I trust him wholly after all that had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7136",8778,"come and gone? but when I saw that there was no feigning in his sleep, I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7137",8778,"set that doubt aside, and knew not what to make of it.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7138",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7139",8778,"Thus passed an hour, and from time to time I shook him and strove to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7140",8778,"waken him, but it was all in vain; so I knew none other rede than to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7141",8778,"abide his awakening; for I knew not the way to take toward this castle;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7142",8778,"and, moreover, though he were a knight, and armed, yet might it be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7143",8778,"perilous for him if he were left there alone and unguarded; so I abode.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7144",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7145",8778,"But now came new tidings.  Methought I heard the sound of the tinkling of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7146",8778,"weapons and armour; the green highway so turned that a wood neb about an","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7147",8778,"hundred yards to the north hid it from my sight, so that a man might have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7148",8778,"drawn somewhat near to us without being seen, came he on the hither side","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7149",8778,"of the river.  So I stood up hastily, and strung my bow, and took a shaft","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7150",8778,"in my fingers, and no sooner was it done than there came a rider round","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7151",8778,"about the aforesaid wood neb.  He was all-armed and had a red surcoat,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7152",8778,"and rode a great shining bay horse.  I kept my eye upon him while I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7153",8778,"stirred the sleeping knight with my foot, and cried to him to wake, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7154",8778,"he scarce moved, and but uttered words without sense.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7155",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7156",8778,"Now the new-comer drew rein for a moment when he saw us, and then moved","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7157",8778,"on a little toward me, but I nocked a shaft and pointed it at him, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7158",8778,"cried out to him to stay.  Then I heard a great rattling laugh come from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7159",8778,"him, and he shouted: Nay, do thou stay, fair wood-wife, and I will risk","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7160",8778,"thy shafts to come at thee.  But why doth not the sluggard at thy feet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7161",8778,"rise up and stand before me, if he be thy loveling?  Or is he dead?  His","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7162",8778,"voice was harsh and big, and I feared him sore; and it was as much","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7163",8778,"because of fear as of hardihood, that I drew and loosed straightway; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7164",8778,"doubtless it was because of fear that I saw my shaft fly an inch or so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7165",8778,"over his right shoulder.  I heard his rattling laugh again, and saw him","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7166",8778,"bend forward as he spurred; I knew that time lacked for drawing another","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7167",8778,"shaft, so I caught up my skirts and ran all I might; but swift-foot as I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7168",8778,"be, it availed me nought, for I was cumbered with my gown, and moreover I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7169",8778,"was confused with not knowing whither to run, since I wotted that in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7170",8778,"water the horse would do better than I.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7171",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7172",8778,"So he was up with me in a twinkling, and reached out his hand and caught","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7173",8778,"hold of me by the hair, and tugged me to him as he reined back his horse.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7174",8778,"Then he laughed again and said: Forsooth she will look better when she is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7175",8778,"no longer reddened and roughened with fleeing; and, by Red Peter! what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7176",8778,"limbs she hath.  Then he let me loose and got off his horse, and shoved","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7177",8778,"me on before him till we came to where the Black One lay still sleeping","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7178",8778,"heavily.  Then the Red Knight stood against me, and looked hard into my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7179",8778,"face; and I saw how huge a man he was, and how a lock of bright red hair","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7180",8778,"came out from under his sallet.  His eyes were green and fierce","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7181",8778,"underneath shaggy red eyebrows; terrible he was to look on.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7182",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7183",8778,"Now he spake fiercely and roughly, and as though he had something against","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7184",8778,"me: Tell me, thou, who thou art and who this is?  I answered nought, for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7185",8778,"fear had frozen my speech.  He stamped his foot on the ground and cried:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7186",8778,"Hah! art thou gone dumb?  Speak! thou wert best!  I said, all quaking: My","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7187",8778,"name is Birdalone; I belong to no one; I have no kindred: as for this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7188",8778,"man, I know not his name.  He said: Comest thou from the Castle of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7189",8778,"Quest?  Art thou the whore of those lily-and-rose champions there?  My","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7190",8778,"heart was hot with anger in spite of my dread, but I spake: I came from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7191",8778,"the Castle of the Quest.  He said: And this man (therewith he turned","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7192",8778,"about and spurned him in the side), where didst thou happen upon him?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7193",8778,"Again I was silent, and he roared out at me: So thou wilt not answer!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7194",8778,"Beware, or I may see how to compel the speech of thee.  Now answer me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7195",8778,"this: Was it in the Black Valley of the Greywethers that ye two came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7196",8778,"together?  Again I knew not how to answer, lest I might do a wrong to him","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7197",8778,"who had repented him of the wrong he had done me.  But the Red Knight","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7198",8778,"burst out a-laughing and said: It shall be remembered against thee,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7199",8778,"first, that thou didst let fly a shaft at me; second, that thou didst run","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7200",8778,"from me; and thirdly, that thou hast been slack in answering my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7201",8778,"questions.  But all this scathes me nought; first, because thy shaft","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7202",8778,"missed me; second, because thy legs failed thee (though they were fair to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7203",8778,"look on, running); and third, because all thou canst tell me I know","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7204",8778,"without thine answering.  Now thee will I tell that this is Friday, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7205",8778,"that ye two first met in the Black Valley on Tuesday; now I will ask this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7206",8778,"last question, and thou mayst answer it or not as thou wilt; for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7207",8778,"presently I shall wake this brisk and stirring knight, and I deem that he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7208",8778,"will tell me the truth of this if of nought else.  Tell me, thou whore of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7209",8778,"the Questing Champions, where and how many times thou hast lain in this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7210",8778,"good knight’s arms since last Tuesday?  Nowhere and never, quoth I.  Thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7211",8778,"liest, I doubt thee, said the Red Knight; howsoever, let us see what this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7212",8778,"doughty one will say.  Hah! thou deemest he shall be hard to wake up,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7213",8778,"dost thou not!  Well, I shall see to that.  He who giveth sleep may take","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7214",8778,"it away again.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7215",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7216",8778,"Therewith he went up to the Black One and stooped adown over his head,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7217",8778,"and spake some words over him, but so softly that I heard not their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7218",8778,"import; and straightway the sleeper rose up so suddenly that he wellnigh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7219",8778,"smote against the Red Knight.  He stood awhile staggering, and blinking","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7220",8778,"at the other one, but somehow got his sword drawn forth, and the Red","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7221",8778,"Knight hindered him nought therein, but spake anon when the other was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7222",8778,"come to himself somewhat: The sele of the day to thee, Sir Thomas, True","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7223",8778,"Thomas!  Fair is thy bed, and most fair thy bedfellow.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7224",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7225",8778,"The Black Knight drew aback from him and was now come awake, wherefore he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7226",8778,"stood on his guard, but said nought.  Then said the Red Knight: Sir","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7227",8778,"Thomas, I have been asking this fair lady a question, but her memory","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7228",8778,"faileth her and she may not answer it; perchance thou mayst do better.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7229",8778,"Tell me where and how many times hast thou bedded her betwixt last","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7230",8778,"Tuesday and this?  Nowhere and never, cried Sir Thomas, knitting his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7231",8778,"brows and handling his sword.  Hah, said the Red Knight, an echo of her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7232",8778,"speech is this.  Lo, the tale ye have made up betwixt you.  But at least,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7233",8778,"having done mine errand, though meseemeth somewhat leisurely, and having","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7234",8778,"gotten the woman for me, thou art now bringing her on to the Red Hold,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7235",8778,"whatever thou hast done with her on the road?  I am not, said my fellow,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7236",8778,"I am leading her away from the Red Hold.  Pity of thee, quoth the other,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7237",8778,"that thou hast fallen in with me, and thou but half-armed.  And he raised","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7238",8778,"aloft his sword; but presently sank it again, and let the point rest on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7239",8778,"the earth.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7240",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7241",8778,"Then he spoke again, not mockingly as erst: A word before we end it,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7242",8778,"Thomas: thou hast hitherto done well by me, as I by thee.  I say thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7243",8778,"hast gotten this woman, and I doubt not that at first thou hadst the mind","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7244",8778,"to bring her to me unminished; but then thou wert overcome by her beauty,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7245",8778,"as forsooth I know thee woman-mad, and thou hadst meant to keep her for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7246",8778,"thyself, as forsooth I marvel not.  But in thy love-making thou hast not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7247",8778,"bethought thee that keep her to thyself thou mayst not while I am above","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7248",8778,"ground, save thou bewray me, and join thee to my foemen and thine.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7249",8778,"Because I am such a man, that what I desire that will I have.  For this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7250",8778,"reason, when I misdoubted me of thee for thy much-tarrying, I cast the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7251",8778,"sleep over thee, and have caught thee.  For what wilt thou do?  Doubt it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7252",8778,"not, that if our swords meet, I shall pay thee for trying to take my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7253",8778,"bedthrall from me by taking from thee no more than thy life.  But now","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7254",8778,"will I forgive thee all if thou wilt ride home quietly with me and this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7255",8778,"damsel-errant to the Red Hold, and let her be mine and not thine so long","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7256",8778,"as I will; and then afterwards, if thou wilt, she shall be thine as long","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7257",8778,"as thou wilt.  Now behold, both this chance and thy life is a mere gift","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7258",8778,"of me to thee, for otherwise thou shalt have neither damsel nor life.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7259",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7260",8778,"Yea, yea, said my friend, I know what thou wouldest: I have been no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7261",8778,"unhandy devil to thee this long while, and thou wouldst fain keep me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7262",8778,"still; but now I will be devil no longer, on this earth at least, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7263",8778,"will die and take my luck of it.  And do thou, God, see to the saving of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7264",8778,"this damsel, since thou hast taken the matter out of my hands.  Farewell,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7265",8778,"dear maiden!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7266",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7267",8778,"Scarce was the word out of his mouth ere his sword was in the air, and he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7268",8778,"smote so fierce and straight that he beat down the huge man’s blade, and,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7269",8778,"ere he could master it again, smote the Red Knight so heavily on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7270",8778,"crest that he fell to his knees; and the heart rose in me, for I deemed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7271",8778,"that he might yet prevail; and in as ’twere a flash I bethought me of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7272",8778,"knife at my girdlestead, and drew it and ran to the Red Knight, and tore","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7273",8778,"aside his mail hood with one hand and thrust the knife into his shoulder","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7274",8778,"with the other; but so mighty was he that he heeded nought the hurt, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7275",8778,"swept his sword back-handed at the Black Knight’s unarmed leg, and smote","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7276",8778,"him so sore a wound that down he fell clattering.  Then arose the Red","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7277",8778,"Knight, and thrust me from him with the left hand, and strode over my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7278",8778,"fellow-farer and thrust his sword through his throat.  Then he turned to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7279",8778,"me, and spake in a braying voice as if a harsh horn were blown:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7280",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7281",8778,"Abide thou; if thou takest one step I will slay thee at once.  So he went","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7282",8778,"and sat down on a bank a little way from the dead man, and wiped his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7283",8778,"sword on the grass and laid it beside him, and so sat pondering a while.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7284",8778,"Thereafter he called me to him, and bade me stand in face of him with my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7285",8778,"hands clasped before me.  Then he spake to me: Thou art my thrall and my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7286",8778,"having, since I had thus doomed it no few days ago; and thou art now in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7287",8778,"my hands for me to do with as I will.  Now instead of being meek and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7288",8778,"obedient to me thou hast rebelled against me, shot an arrow at me, run","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7289",8778,"from me, denied answer to my questions, and thrust a knife into me.  To","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7290",8778,"be short, thou hast made thyself my foe.  Furthermore, it is by thy doing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7291",8778,"that I have lost a right good servant and a trusty fellow, and one that I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7292",8778,"loved; it is thou that hast slain him.  Now have I been pondering what I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7293",8778,"shall do with thee.  I said: If I have deserved the death, then make an","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7294",8778,"end and slay me presently; but bring me not to thine house, I pray thee.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7295",8778,"I pray by the mother that bore thee!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7296",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7297",8778,"Quoth he: Hold thy peace, it is not what thou deservest that I am looking","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7298",8778,"to, but what shall pleasure me.  Now hearken; I say that thou hast made","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7299",8778,"thee my foe, and I have overcome thee; thou art my runaway thrall, and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7300",8778,"have caught thee.  As my foe I might slay thee in any evil way it might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7301",8778,"like me; as my thrall I might well chastise thee as sharply and as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7302",8778,"bitterly as I would.  But it is not my pleasure to slay thee, rather I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7303",8778,"will bring thee to the Red Hold, and there see what we may make of thee;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7304",8778,"whereas I cannot but deem that in thee is the making of somewhat more","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7305",8778,"than a thrall; and if not, then a thrall must thou needs be.  Again as to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7306",8778,"the chastising of thee, that also I forgive thee since I have gotten the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7307",8778,"hope aforesaid.  Yet forsooth some shame must I do thee to pay thee back","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7308",8778,"for the love that was betwixt thee and the slain man.  I will ponder what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7309",8778,"it shall be; but take heed that whatsoever it shall be, it will not avail","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7310",8778,"thee to pray me to forego it, though thy speech be as fair and sweet as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7311",8778,"thy body.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7312",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7313",8778,"Therewith he was silent a while, and I stood there not daring to move,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7314",8778,"and my heart was so downcast that all the sweetness of life seemed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7315",8778,"departed.  Yet I withheld lamentations or prayers, thinking within","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7316",8778,"myself, who knows what occasion may be between this and the Red Hold for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7317",8778,"my escaping; let me keep myself alive for that if it may be.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7318",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7319",8778,"Presently he arose and took his sword, and went up to the slain man’s","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7320",8778,"body and smote the head from off it.  Then he went to the two horses of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7321",8778,"Sir Thomas and of me, and took from them such gear of girths and thongs","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7322",8778,"as he would, and therewith he dight me as ye saw, doing a girth about my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7323",8778,"middle and making me fast to a line wherewith to hold me in tow.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7324",8778,"then he did that other thing which sickens my very soul to tell of, to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7325",8778,"wit, that he took the slain man’s head and tied a lace thereto, and hung","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7326",8778,"it about my neck; and as he did so, he said: This jewel shalt thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7327",8778,"thyself bear to mine house; and there belike shall we lay it in earth,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7328",8778,"since the man was my trusty fellow.  Lo now, this is all the ill I shall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7575",8778,"the north-east, and it came on swiftly with a blue ripple of the lake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7576",8778,"behind it.  Thereat we marvelled, and yet more when we saw that its sail","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7577",8778,"was striped of gold and green and black; next then were we betwixt fear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7689",8778,"which ye had lent to Birdalone; then we did on our armour, and advised us","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7690",8778,"of whereabout on the isle we were, and we saw the orchards and gardens","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7691",8778,"before us, and the great fair house above all, even as ye told us of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7692",8778,"them, Birdalone.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7693",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7694",8778,"Next, then, without more ado, we went our ways up through the orchard and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7695",8778,"the gardens, and when we were well-nigh at the end of them, and in face","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7696",8778,"of those many steps ye spake of, we saw at the foot of them a tall woman","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7697",8778,"clad in red scarlet, standing as if she abode our coming.  When we drew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7698",8778,"nigh we saw that she was strong-looking, well-knit, white-skinned,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7699",8778,"yellow-haired, and blue-eyed, and might have been called a fair woman, as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7700",8778,"to her shaping, save that her face was heavy, yet hard-looking, with thin","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7701",8778,"lips and somewhat flagging cheeks, a face stupid, but proud and cruel.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7702",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7703",8778,"She hailed us as we came up, and said: Men-at-arms, ye be welcome to our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7704",8778,"house, and I bid you to eat and drink and abide here.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7705",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7706",8778,"Then we louted before her, and bade her Hail; and Baudoin said: Lady, thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7707",8778,"bidding will we take; yet have we an errand to declare ere we break bread","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7708",8778,"with thee, lest when it is told we be not so welcome as ye tell us now.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7709",8778,"What is it? said she.  Said Baudoin: This man here is called the Green","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7710",8778,"Knight, and this the Black Squire, and I am the Golden Knight; and now","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7711",8778,"will we ask thee if this isle be called the Isle of Increase Unsought?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7712",8778,"Even so have I called it, quoth she, wherefore I deem none other will","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7713",8778,"dare call it otherwise.  It is well, quoth Baudoin; but we have heard say","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7714",8778,"that hereto had strayed three dear friends of ours, three maidens, who","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7715",8778,"hight Viridis, the friend of the Green Knight, and Atra, who is the Black","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7716",8778,"Squire’s, and Aurea, who is mine own friend, so we have come to take them","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7717",8778,"home with us, since they have been so long away from their land and their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7718",8778,"loves.  Now if they be thy friends thou wilt perchance let them go for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7719",8778,"love’s sake and the eking of friendship; but if they be thy captives,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7720",8778,"then are we well willing to pay thee ransom, not according to their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7721",8778,"worth, for no treasure heaped up might come nigh it, but according to thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7722",8778,"desire, lady.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7723",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7724",8778,"Laughed the proud lady scornfully and said: Big are thy words, Sir","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7725",8778,"Knight: if I had these maidens in my keeping I would give them unto you","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7726",8778,"for nothing, and deem that I had the best of the bargain.  But here are","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7727",8778,"they not.  True it is that I had here three thralls who were hight as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7728",8778,"thou hast said; but a while ago, not many days, they transgressed against","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7729",8778,"me till I chastised them; and then was I weary of them and would be quit","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7730",8778,"of them; for I need no servants here, whereas I myself am enough for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7731",8778,"myself.  Wherefore I sent them away across the water to my sister, who","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7732",8778,"dwells in a fair place hight the House under the Wood; for she needeth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7733",8778,"servants, because the earth there yieldeth nought save to the tiller and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7734",8778,"the herdsman and the hunter, while here all cometh unsought.  With her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7735",8778,"may ye deal, for what I know, and buy the maidens whom ye prize so high;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7736",8778,"though belike ye may have to give her other servants in their place.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7737",8778,"For, indeed, a while ago her thrall fled from her and left her half","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7738",8778,"undone, and it is said that she came hither in her shamelessness: but I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7739",8778,"know not; if she did, she slipped through my fingers, or else I would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7740",8778,"have made her rue her impudence.  Now meseemeth, Sir Knights, here is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7741",8778,"enough of so small and foolish a matter; and again I pray you to enter my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7742",8778,"poor house, and take meat and drink along with me, for ye be none the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7743",8778,"less welcome because of your errand, though it be a foolish one.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7744",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7745",8778,"Now would Sir Baudoin have answered wrathfully, but Arthur plucked at his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7746",8778,"skirt, and he yeasaid the lady’s bidding, though somewhat ungraciously;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7747",8778,"but that she heeded nought; she took Sir Baudoin by the hand and led him","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7748",8778,"up the stately perron, and thence came we into a pillared hall, as fair","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7749",8778,"as might be.  And there on the dais was a table dight with dainty meats","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7750",8778,"and drinks, and the lady bade us thereto, and we sat to it.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7751",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7752",8778,"Thereat was the lady buxom and merry: Baudoin scowled across the board; I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7753",8778,"was wary and silent; but Arthur was as blithe with the lady as she with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7754",8778,"him; nor did I altogether marvel thereat, since I knew him wise of wit.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7755",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7756",8778,"But when we were done with the meal, the lady stood up and said: Now, Sir","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7757",8778,"Knights, I will give you leave; but this house is as your own to roam","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7758",8778,"through all its chambers and pleasure you with its wonders and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7759",8778,"goodliness; and when ye are weary of the house, then is the orchard and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7760",8778,"the garden free to you, and all the isle wheresoever ye will go.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7761",8778,"here in this hall is meat and drink for you whenso ye will; but if ye","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7762",8778,"would see me again to-day, then shall ye meet me where ye first happened","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7763",8778,"on me e’en now, at the foot of the great perron.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7764",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7765",8778,"Then she laid her hand on Arthur’s shoulder, and said: Thy big friend may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7766",8778,"search out every nook in this house, and every bush in the whole island,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7767",8778,"and if he find there the maidens he spake of, one or all of them, then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7768",8778,"are they a gift from me unto him.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7769",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7770",8778,"Therewith she turned, and went out of the hall by a door in the side","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7771",8778,"thereof; and now already meseemed that though the woman was hateful and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7772",8778,"thick-hearted and cruel, yet she was become fairer, or seemed so, than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7773",8778,"when we first came on her; and for my part I pondered on what it might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7774",8778,"grow to, and fear of her came into my soul.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7775",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7776",8778,"Now spake Baudoin: Fellows, let us get out into the garden at least; for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7777",8778,"this place is evil, and meseems it smells and tastes of tears and blood,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7778",8778,"and that evil wights that hate the life of men are lurking in the nooks","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7779",8778,"thereof.  And lo, our very she-friend that was so kind and simple and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7780",8778,"dainty with us, there is, as it were, the image of the dear maiden","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7781",8778,"standing trembling and naked before the stupid malice of this lump of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7782",8778,"flesh.  So spake he, Birdalone.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7783",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7784",8778,"But I said to Arthur in a soft voice: And when shall we slay her?  Said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7785",8778,"he: Not until we have gotten from her all that may be gotten; and that is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7786",8778,"the living bodies of our friends.  But come we forth.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7787",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7788",8778,"So did we, and came down to the orchard and did off our helms, and lay","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7789",8778,"down under a big apple-tree which was clear of cover all round about, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7790",8778,"so fell to our redes; and I asked Arthur what he deemed of the story of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7791",8778,"our loves having been carried to the House under the Wood, and if it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7792",8778,"might not be tried seeking thither; but he laughed and said: Never would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7793",8778,"she have told us thereof had it been sooth: doubtless our friends are","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7794",8778,"here on this isle, but, as I deem, not in the house, else had not the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7795",8778,"witch left all the house free for us to search into.  Yea, said I, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7796",8778,"how if they be in her prison?  Said he: It is not hard to find out which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7797",8778,"is the prison of so dainty a house as is yonder; and when we had found","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7798",8778,"it, soon should we have hit upon a way to break it, since we be three,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7799",8778,"and stout fellows enough.  Nay, I deem that the lovelings be stowed away","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7800",8778,"in some corner of the isle without the house, and that mayhappen we shall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7801",8778,"find them there; and yet I trow not before we have made guile meet guile,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7802",8778,"and overcome the sorceress.  But come now, let us be doing, and begin to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7803",8778,"quarter this little land as the kestrel doth the water-meadow; and leave","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7804",8778,"we our armour, lest we weary us, for we shall have no need for hard","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7805",8778,"strokes.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7806",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7807",8778,"We hung up there on the tree helm and shield and hauberk, and all our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7808",8778,"defences, and went our ways quartering the isle; and the work was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7809",8778,"toilsome, but we rested not till the time was come to keep tryst with the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7810",8778,"lady; and all that while we found no sign of the darling ones: and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7811",8778,"isle was everywhere a meadow as fair as a garden, with little copses of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7812",8778,"sweet-growing trees here and there, and goodly brooks of water, but no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7813",8778,"tillage anywhere: wild things, as hart and buck and roe, we came upon,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7814",8778,"and smaller deer withal, but all unhurtful to man; but of herding was no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7815",8778,"token.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7816",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7817",8778,"Came we then back to that lordly perron, and there, at the foot thereof,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7818",8778,"stood the witch-wife, and received us joyously; clad was she all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7819",8778,"gloriously in red scarlet broidered and begemmed; her arms bare and her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7820",8778,"feet sandalled, and her yellow hair hanging down from under its garland;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7821",8778,"and certainly it was so that she had grown fairer, and was sleek and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7822",8778,"white and well-shapen, and well-haired; yet by all that, the visage of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7823",8778,"her was little bettered, and unto me she was loathsome.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7824",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7825",8778,"Now the feast went much as the earlier meal had done; and Baudoin was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7826",8778,"surly and Arthur blithe and buxom; and nought befell to tell of, save","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7827",8778,"that dishes and meats, and flasks and cups, and all things came upon the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7828",8778,"board as if they were borne thereon by folk unseen; and thereat we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7829",8778,"wondered not much, considering in what wonder-house we were.  But the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7830",8778,"lady-witch looked on us and smiled, and said: Knights, ye marvel at the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7831",8778,"manner of our service, but call to mind that we told you this morning","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7832",8778,"that we were enough for Ourselves, and we have so dight our days here","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7833",8778,"that whoso is our friend on this Isle of Increase shall lack nothing.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7834",8778,"Fear not, therefore, to see aught ugly in our servants as now unseen, if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7835",8778,"their shapes were made manifest unto you.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7836",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7837",8778,"All things were we heedful to note at this banquet; but when it was over,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7838",8778,"then came music into the hall from folk unseen, but not as if the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7839",8778,"musicians were a many, only belike some three or four.  And thereat the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7840",8778,"lady spake, saying: Knights, ye may deem our minstrels but few, but such","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7841",8778,"is our mind that we love not our music overloud, and for the most part","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7842",8778,"only three sing or play unto us at one time.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7843",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7844",8778,"Thereafter the lady brought us to fair chambers, and we slept there in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7845",8778,"all ease, and we arose on the morrow and found the lady still blithe with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7846",8778,"us; yet I noted this, that she seemed to deal with Arthur as if she saw","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7847",8778,"him now for the first time, and much he seemed to be to her liking.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7848",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7849",8778,"Again we fared forth, and were no less diligent in searching the isle","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7850",8778,"than erst, and found nought; and all went that day as before.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7851",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7852",8778,"On the morrow (that is, the third day) the witch seemed to have somewhat","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7853",8778,"more memory of Arthur than erst, and even yet more liking of him, so that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7854",8778,"she reached out her hand for him to kiss, which needs must he do, despite","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7855",8778,"his loathing of her.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7856",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7857",8778,"When we had lain under the apple-tree a little while, Baudoin spake and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7858",8778,"said: Yesterday and the day before we searched the open land and found","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7859",8778,"nought; now to-day let us search the house, and if we find nought, then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7860",8778,"at least it shall lie behind us.  We yeasaid it, and presently went back,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7861",8778,"and from chamber to chamber, and all was fair and goodly as might be, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7862",8778,"we marvelled what would betide to it when the witch was undone and her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7863",8778,"sorcery come to an end.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7865",8778,"To the Wailing Tower we came, and up the stairs, and found the door open","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7866",8778,"of the prison-chamber, and all there as thou hast told us, Birdalone;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7867",8778,"only we opened the great coffer, whence thou didst refrain thee, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7868",8778,"found it full of hideous gear truly, as fetters and chains, and whips and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7869",8778,"rods, and evil tools of the tormentors, and cursed it all and came away;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7870",8778,"and Arthur said: Lo you, this stupid one!  How eager is she to bid us","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7871",8778,"what to do, and to tell us that our ladies are not in this evil house,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7872",8778,"since she leaveth all open to us.  Yet we went about the house without,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7873",8778,"and counted the windows heedfully to see that we had missed no chamber,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7874",8778,"and found nought amiss; and then we went in again and sought as low down","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7875",8778,"as we might, to see if perchance some dungeon there were underground, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7876",8778,"found nought save a very goodly undercroft below the great hall, which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7877",8778,"was little less fair than that which was above it.  So came the evening","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7878",8778,"and the banquet, and the end of that day; but the witch-wife led Arthur","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7879",8778,"by the hand to the board, and afterwards to the chamber ere we slept.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7880",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7881",8778,"On the fourth day and the fifth it was no otherwise than erst; and when I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7882",8778,"fared to bed I felt confused in my head and sick of heart.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7884",8778,"The night of the next day (the sixth), as we went to our chambers, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7885",8778,"the witch-wife and Arthur hand-in-hand, she stayed him a while, and spake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7886",8778,"eagerly to him in a soft voice; and as he came up to me afterwards he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7887",8778,"said: To-night I have escaped it, but there will not be escape for long.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7888",8778,"From what? said I.  He said: From bedding her; for now it has come to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7889",8778,"this, that presently we must slay her at once and have no knowledge of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"7891",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7892",8778,"In such wise passed four more days, and it was the twelfth morning of our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7893",8778,"sojourn there, and we went forth on our search of every mead and every","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7894",8778,"covert of the isle, and all day we found nought to our purpose; but as it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7895",8778,"grew toward sunset, and there grew great clouds in the eastern ort, piled","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7896",8778,"up and copper-coloured, we came over a bent on to a little green dale","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7897",8778,"watered by a clear brook, and as we looked down into it we saw something","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7898",8778,"shine amongst its trees; so we hastened toward that gleam, and lo, amidst","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7899",8778,"the dale, with the brook running through it, a strange garth we saw.  For","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7900",8778,"there was a pavilion done of timber and board, and gaily painted and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7901",8778,"gilded, and out from that house was, as it were, a great cage of thin","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7902",8778,"gilded bars, both walls and roof, just so wide apart as no one","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7903",8778,"full-grown, carl or quean, could thrust through.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7904",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7905",8778,"Thitherward then ran we, shouting, for we saw at once that in the said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7906",8778,"cage were three women whose aspect was that of our sweetlings, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7907",8778,"presently we were standing by the said herse, reaching our hands out to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7908",8778,"them to come to us and tell us their tale, and that we would deliver","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7909",8778,"them.  But they stood together in the midst of the said cage, and though","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7910",8778,"they gazed piteously on us thence, and reached out their hands to us,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7911",8778,"they neither spake nor came to the herse to us; so we deemed that they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7912",8778,"were bewitched, and our joy was dashed.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7913",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7914",8778,"Then we went all about the cage and the pavilion to find ingate, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7915",8778,"found it not; and then the three of us together strove with the bars of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7916",8778,"the herse, and shook and swayed them, but it was all to no purpose.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7917",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7918",8778,"Moreover, while we were at this work the sun seemed to go out, and there","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7919",8778,"came a heavy black mist rolling into the dale, and wrapped us about so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7920",8778,"that we saw not each other’s faces, and the bars of the herse were gone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7921",8778,"from our hands as we stood there.  Then came rain and thunder and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7922",8778,"lightning on to the black night, and by the glare of the lightning we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7923",8778,"could see the leaves and grass of the dale, but neither herse nor house","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7924",8778,"nor woman.  So we abode there in the dark night, and the storm all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7925",8778,"bewildered us, till the rain and clouds drew off and it was calm fair","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7926",8778,"starlight again, but clean gone was the golden cage and they that stood","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7927",8778,"therein; and we turned sadly, and went our ways toward the witch-house.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7928",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7929",8778,"On the way said Arthur: Brethren, this meseemeth is but a-going on with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7930",8778,"the shows which were played us on the water as we came hither; but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7931",8778,"whether she doth this but for to mock and torment us, or that she would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7932",8778,"beguile us into deeming that our friends are verily here, I wot not; but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7933",8778,"to-morrow, meseemeth, I shall can to tell you.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7934",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7935",8778,"Now came we to the perron of the house, and there stood the witch-wife","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7936",8778,"under the stars to meet us.  And when she saw us, she took hold of Arthur","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7937",8778,"by the hand and the arm to caress him, and found that he and we were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7938",8778,"drenched with the rain and the storm, as might well be deemed; then she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7939",8778,"bade us up to our chambers to do on raiment which she had dight for us,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7940",8778,"and we went thither, and found our garments rich and dainty indeed; but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7941",8778,"when we came down into the hall where the witch abode us, we saw that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7942",8778,"Arthur’s raiment was far the richest and daintiest.  But the witch ran to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7943",8778,"him and cast her arms about him, and clipped and kissed him before the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7944",8778,"others, and he suffered it.  So sped the feast again.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7945",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7946",8778,"But when they went to bed, the said witch took Arthur’s hand and spake a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7947",8778,"word unto him, and led him away, and he went with her as one nought loth;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7948",8778,"but we twain were afraid lest she should destroy him when she had had her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7949",8778,"will of him.  Wherefore we waked through the more part of the night with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7950",8778,"our swords ready to hand.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7951",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7952",8778,"But when we were clad in the morn he came unto us, he also clad, and was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7953",8778,"downcast and shamefaced indeed, but safe and sound; and he said: Speak no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7954",8778,"word about our matter till we be out in the open air, for I fear all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7955",8778,"things about us.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7956",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7957",8778,"So when we had gone forth and were under the apple-tree once more, spake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7958",8778,"Arthur: Now, lords, am I shamed for ever, for I have become the leman of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7959",8778,"this evil creature; but I pray ye not to mock me; and that the more as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7960",8778,"the same lot may happen on you both, or either; for I can see for sure","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7961",8778,"that the wretch will weary of me and desire one of you two.  Let it pass.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7962",8778,"Somewhat have I found out from her, but not much; first, that she has","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7963",8778,"forgotten her first lie, to wit, how she sent our ladies to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7964",8778,"sister-witch; for I told her of the golden cage, and how we had missed it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7965",8778,"in the storm; and she said: Though I deem it a folly that ye should seek","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7966",8778,"these thralls, yet would I help you if I might, since ye are now become","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7967",8778,"my dear friends.  Though, forsooth, when ye meet them I deem that ye will","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7968",8778,"find them sore changed to you.  For, as I told you, they fled away from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7969",8778,"me, after I had chastised them for a treason, into the hidden places of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7970",8778,"the isle, whereas they had no keel to sail away hence.  And I cared not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7971",8778,"to follow them, as I myself am queen and lady of all things here, and am","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7972",8778,"enough for myself, save when love constraineth me, dear lord.  Now, my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7973",8778,"rede is that ye seek the golden cage again and yet again, because I deem","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7974",8778,"that these thralls have somehow learned some wisdom, and they have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7975",8778,"enchanted the said cage for a defence against me, from whom they might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7976",8778,"not hide as they did from you; for of me have they stolen their wizardry,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7977",8778,"and I am their mistress therein.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7978",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7979",8778,"This, therefore, is the new lie of her, and my rede is that we heed it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7980",8778,"nought.  For my mind is that she it is that hath made the appearance of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7981",8778,"the cage and the women therein, and that she hath our poor friends","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7982",8778,"somewhere underneath her hand.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7983",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7984",8778,"Now this we deemed most like; yet whereas we had nought to do with the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7985",8778,"time, which, now that we had searched the isle throughly, hung heavy on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7986",8778,"hand, we deemed it good to go to the dale of the golden cage again,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7987",8778,"though we looked not to find the cage there any more.  But this betid,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7988",8778,"that we found the little dale easily enough, and there stood the cage as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7989",8778,"we had seen it yesterday, but nought was there within its bright bars","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7990",8778,"save the grass and the flowers, and the water of the brook a-running.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7991",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7992",8778,"We loitered about that place a while, and went back to the house in due","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7993",8778,"time; and to shorten the tale, I shall tell that for many days it betid","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7994",8778,"that we went every day to seek the golden cage, but after the first three","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7995",8778,"days we saw it no more.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7996",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7997",8778,"Now began sadness and weariness to overcome us as the days and weeks","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"7998",8778,"wore, and belike the witch-wife noted it that we were worse company than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8000",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8001",8778,"And now on a day Arthur bade us note that the said witch was growing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8002",8778,"weary of him, and he bade me look to it; for, said he, she is turning her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8003",8778,"face toward thee, brother.  My heart burned with rage at that word; I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8004",8778,"said nought, but made up my mind that I would try to bring the matter to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8005",8778,"an end.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8006",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8007",8778,"That same night befell what Arthur had threatened; for the feast being","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8008",8778,"done in the evening, the witch drew me aside while the music was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8009",8778,"a-playing, and caressed my hand and my shoulder, and said: I am yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8010",8778,"wondering at you Champions, that ye must needs follow after those three","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8011",8778,"wretched thralls, whom never will ye find, for they. need ye not, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8012",8778,"will flee from you if ye have sight of them, as they did that other day;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8013",8778,"and therein they are scarce in the wrong, whereas they may well think","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8014",8778,"that if ye find them they should fall into my hands; for easily may I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8015",8778,"take them any day that I will, and then I have a case against them, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8016",8778,"may lawfully chastise them according to the law that has been given unto","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8017",8778,"me; and then shall they be in grievous plight.  Wherefore the rede We","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8018",8778,"give unto you three now is the rede of friendliness that ye make","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8019",8778,"yourselves happy in Our Island, and then will We do everything We may for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8023",8778,"pleasure, that also may be gotten for you; for We be not wholly without","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8024",8778,"power in these waters, though We have no keel or ferry upon them.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8025",8778,"now, thou fair lad, We give thee this last word: Ye Champions have been","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8026",8778,"dwelling in Our house a long while, and that while have ever striven to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8027",8778,"thwart Us.  We now counsel you to make an end of it, and it shall be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8033",8778,"else we were all undone; withal I saw somewhat of truth thrusting up","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8034",8778,"through her much lying, and I deemed, even as Arthur did, that she had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8039",8778,"very far from the water we came upon a wood or big thicket which was new","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8040",8778,"to us.  So we entered it, and as we went and noted the wild things of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8041",8778,"wood going hither and thither, we espied afar off the shape of a man","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8042",8778,"going amidst the thicket; wherefore we went warily towards him, lest he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8044",8778,"it was a woman, though she was clad as a hunter, with legs naked to above","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8045",8778,"the knee.  She had a quiver at her back and a bow in her hand, and her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8046",8778,"coat was black of hue.  Belike now she heard our going amongst the dry","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8047",8778,"leaves, for she turned her face to us, and lo! it was the face of Atra.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8048",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8049",8778,"When she saw us, she gave a shrill cry, and fell to running at her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8050",8778,"swiftest away from us, and we followed all we might, but we could not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8051",8778,"over-run her, though we kept her in sight ever, till we had run all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8052",8778,"through the wood, and before us was the sheer side of a rocky hill and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8053",8778,"the mouth of a cave therein, and by the said mouth who should there be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8054",8778,"but Aurea and Viridis, as we thought, clad in gold and in green, but the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8055",8778,"fashion of their raiment not otherwise than Atra’s.  Their bows were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8056",8778,"bended and they had shafts in their hands, and as we came out of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8057",8778,"thicket into the open lawn before the cave, Viridis nocked a shaft and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8058",8778,"aimed at us and drew, and the shaft flew over my head; therewith mocking","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8059",8778,"laughter came from them, and they ran into the cave.  Speedily we ran up","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8060",8778,"to it, but when we came home thither, there was the sheer hillside, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8061",8778,"never a cave nor an opening.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8062",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8063",8778,"Dismayed were we thereat; but more dismayed had we been but that we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8064",8778,"deemed that all this was but a cheat and a painted show put upon us by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8065",8778,"the witch to back up her lying.  Nevertheless we fared the next day to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8066",8778,"seek the wood and the cave in the sheer rock, but nowise might we find","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8067",8778,"either wood or cave.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8068",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8069",8778,"Now it was the night of the day hereafter, as we went to our chambers,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8070",8778,"that the witch-wife took me by the hand and led me apart, and said me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8071",8778,"many soft things of her accursed lust, whereof I will not say one again.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8072",8778,"But the upshot of it all was that she would bring me to her chamber and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8073",8778,"her bed.  And whereas I was determined what to do, and had my war-sword","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8074",8778,"by my side, I naysaid her not, but made her good countenance.  And when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8075",8778,"we came to her chamber, which was full gloriously dight, and fragrant as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8076",8778,"with the scent of the roses and lilies of mid-June, she bade me to lie in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8077",8778,"her bed of gold and ivory and she would be with me anon.  So I unclad","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8078",8778,"myself and laid me down, but I drew forth my sword, and laid the ancient","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8079",8778,"naked blade betwixt my side and her place.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8080",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8081",8778,"Anon she cometh back again unclad, and would step into the bed; but she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8082",8778,"saw the sword and said: What is this, Champion?  Said I: These edges are","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8083",8778,"the token of sundering between us, for there is a spell on me, that with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8084",8778,"no woman may I deal, save with mine only love, but I shall do her mortal","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8085",8778,"scathe; so beware by the token of the grey edges of battle.  She drew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8086",8778,"aback, and was as a spiteful and angry cat, and there was no loveliness","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8087",8778,"in her; and she said: Thou liest, and thou hatest me; see thou to it,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8088",8778,"both for thyself and thy loveling.  And she turned about and strode out","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8089",8778,"of the chamber; but I arose and clad myself in haste, and took my naked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8090",8778,"sword in my hand.  But before I went, I looked around, and espied an","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8091",8778,"ambry fashioned in the wall of the bed-lane, and the door was half open;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8092",8778,"and the said ambry was wrought of the daintiest, all of gold and pearl","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8093",8778,"and gems; and I said to myself: Herein is some treasure, and this is a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8094",8778,"tide of war.  So I opened the ambry, and within it was even more","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8095",8778,"gloriously wrought than without; and there was nought therein, save a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8096",8778,"little flask of crystal done about with bands of gold set with great and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8097",8778,"goodly gems.  So I took the said flask and went my ways hastily to my own","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8098",8778,"chamber, and there I looked at the said flask and took out the stopple;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8099",8778,"and there was a liquor therein, white like to water, but of a spicy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8100",8778,"smell, sweet, fresh, and enheartening.  So I yet thought this was some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8101",8778,"great treasure, and that much hung upon it, could I find out unto what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8102",8778,"use it might be put.  And I said: To-morrow we will put it to the proof.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8103",8778,"Then I put the said flask under my pillow, and laid my sword by my side","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8104",8778,"and slept, and was not ill-content so far.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8105",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8106",8778,"But on the morrow, when I met my fellows, they asked me how I had sped,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8107",8778,"and I told them, Well, and that we would talk the matter over under our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8108",8778,"tree of counsel.  So we went down into the hall, where we met the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8109",8778,"witch-lady; and I looked for it that she would be angry and fierce with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8110",8778,"me; but it went far otherwise; for she was blithe and buxom, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8111",8778,"abounding in endearments more than I could away with.  But this I noted,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8112",8778,"that her eyes wandered, and her speech faltered at whiles, and ever she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8113",8778,"seemed to be seeking somewhat; and withal that her caressing hands were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8114",8778,"seeking if they could aught stowed away in the bosom of my coat.  But all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8115",8778,"was nought, for as we came to the door of the hall I gave Baudoin the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8116",8778,"flask to guard until we should come to our apple-tree of rede.  Wherefore","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8117",8778,"the she-wolf went red and white by turns, and fumed, and fretted her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8118",8778,"bedizenments with unrestful hands, and when she should let us go our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8119",8778,"ways, she lingered and looked back oft, and was loth to depart ere she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8120",8778,"had gotten what she lacked, and that, forsooth, was the said flasket.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8121",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8122",8778,"But when we were without the house, I bade our fellows go with me to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8123",8778,"another place than the wonted apple-tree of rede, and they understood my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8124",8778,"word, and I led them to a little grassy plain without the orchard, where","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8125",8778,"was no covert for a wide space about it, nought but the one linden-tree","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8126",8778,"under which now we sat.  There I told them all the tale of the last night","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8127",8778,"and of the flasket, and put before them all that was in my mind to do","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8128",8778,"that evening at the banquet, and they both of them yeasaid it.  But what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8129",8778,"it was, that shall ye hear anon when we carried the matter through; but I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8130",8778,"bade Baudoin still carry the flasket till the evening.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8131",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8132",8778,"Thereafter we spake of other matters; but soon we had good cause to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8133",8778,"rejoice that we had not talked our talk under the apple-tree (whereas I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8134",8778,"doubted not that the witch would spy upon us there), for not long had we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8135",8778,"been at our talk ere, looking that way, we saw the evil creature by the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8136",8778,"hedge of the orchard and gazing over at us.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8137",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8138",8778,"We arose then, and came to her as if nought had happened; and she bade us","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8139",8778,"walk the garden with her, and we yeasaid it, and went with her, and paced","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8140",8778,"about amidst the flowers and lay on the blossomed grass.  Forsooth, both","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8141",8778,"to her and to us the time hung heavy on hand.  And meseemed that the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8142",8778,"sleekness and fairness of her body was worsened since yesterday, and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8143",8778,"was pale and haggard, and her eyes were wandering and afraid.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8144",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8145",8778,"Now she bade us come a little further into the garden and eat a morsel at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8146",8778,"noon; and we arose, and she brought us to where were vines trellised all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8147",8778,"about and overhead, so that it was like a fair green cloister; and there","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8148",8778,"was a board laid and spread with many dainties of meat and drink.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8149",8778,"she bade us sit.  Verily we had but little stomach to that dinner; and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8150",8778,"said to myself, Poison! poison! and even so my fellows deemed, as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8151",8778,"afterwards they told me.  And I saw Baudoin loosen his sword in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8152",8778,"sheath, and I knew that his mind was to smite at once if he saw aught","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8153",8778,"amiss.  And I, who sat next to the witch, laid my hand on a little dagger","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8154",8778,"which I wore at my girdle.  She also saw this, and turned as pale as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8155",8778,"death, and sat trembling before us; and whatso we ate or drank at that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8156",8778,"board under the rustling vine-leaves, she gave unto us with her own hand;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8157",8778,"and then we wotted full surely that she had meant our deaths there and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8158",8778,"then, but was cowed by the fierce eyes of Baudoin and the threat of my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8159",8778,"hand.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8160",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8161",8778,"Withal it seemed that she might not bear it to sit there long amongst us.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8162",8778,"She rose up and smiled on us as ghastly as a corpse, and gave us leave,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8163",8778,"and went hurrying into the house.  And right glad we were to be at rest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8164",8778,"from her.  Yet as we ourselves durst not go far away from the house, lest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8165",8778,"some new thing might happen, neither could she leave us quite alone, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8166",8778,"thrice again that afternoon at some turn of the garden, or orchard, or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8167",8778,"meadow, we came upon her wan face and eyes full of all hate and staring","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8168",8778,"pride, and she enforced her to smile upon us, and turned away with some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8169",8778,"idle word.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8170",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8171",8778,"At last the sun began to sink, and we went to the perron of the house,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8172",8778,"and found her standing to meet us in her wonted way.  But when we came up","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8173",8778,"she gave no hand to any one of us but went up the stairs before us, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8174",8778,"we followed with no word spoken.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8175",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8176",8778,"There was the hall with the lordly service on the board, and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8177",8778,"wax-candles lighted all about, and the great vault of stone fair and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8178",8778,"stately over it.  We went to the dais and the board and sat down, the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8179",8778,"witch-wife in her gold and ivory chair at the board’s end, and I at her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8180",8778,"right hand and looking down the hall, my two fellows facing me, with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8181",8778,"their backs to the clear of the hall.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8182",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8183",8778,"There we sat, and the meats and drinks were before us as dainty as ever","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8184",8778,"erst; but we put forth no hand to them, but sat staring at each other for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8185",8778,"some two minutes it might be, and the witch looked from one to the other","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8186",8778,"of us, and quaked that her hands shook like palsy.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8187",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8188",8778,"Then I rose up and put my hand to my bosom (for Baudoin had given me the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8189",8778,"flasket ere we came to the perron): I spake in a loud voice, and it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8190",8778,"sounded wild and hard in the goodly hall: My lady, I said, thou art","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8191",8778,"looking but pale now, and sick and downcast.  Drink now to me out of this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8192",8778,"precious flasket, and thou shalt be whole and well.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8193",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8194",8778,"And therewith I held the flasket aloft; but her face changed horribly;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8195",8778,"she sprang up in her chair and reached out her arm to clutch at the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8196",8778,"flasket, screaming like an eagle therewith.  But I thrust her back into","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8197",8778,"the chair with my left hand; and therewith arose Baudoin and Arthur, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8198",8778,"caught her by the shoulders, and bound her fast to the chair with cords","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8199",8778,"that they had gotten thereto.  But when she got her breath she yelled","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8200",8778,"out: Ah, now shall all tumble together, my proudful house and I under it!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8201",8778,"Loose me, traitors! loose me, fools! and give me one draught of the water","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8202",8778,"of might, and then shall I tell you all, and ye shall go free with your","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8203",8778,"thralls if ye will.  Ah! ye will not loose me? ye will not?  Well then,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8204",8778,"at least ye, the fools, shall be under it, and they also, the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8205",8778,"she-traitors, the scourged and tormented fools that might not save","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8206",8778,"themselves from me.  O loose me! loose me! thou in whose arms I have lain","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8207",8778,"so many a night, and give me to drink of the proud water of might!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8208",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8209",8778,"So she yelled; and now had all the fairness gone from her body: flaggy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8210",8778,"and yellow were her limbs, and she looked all over as her face, a lump of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8211",8778,"stupid and cruel pride, and her words lost meaning and changed into mere","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8212",8778,"bestial howling.  But for me, since she so desired that water, I knew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8213",8778,"that it was good for us to drink, and I took out the stopple and drank,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8214",8778,"and it was as if fire ran through all my veins, and I felt my strength","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8215",8778,"three-folded straightway, and most wondrous clear was my sight grown","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8216",8778,"therewith; and I raised my eyes now and looked down the hall, and lo,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8217",8778,"there was Aurea, chained by the ankle to the third pillar from the dais;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8218",8778,"and over against her, Viridis; and next, to the fourth pillar, Atra.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8219",8778,"Then I cried in a loud voice that rang through the witch’s hall: Lo what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8220",8778,"I see!  And I ran round the head of the board, and thrust and dragged","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8221",8778,"Baudoin and Arthur along with me, crying out: Come, come! they are found!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8222",8778,"they are here!  And I came to my sweetling, and found her clad but in her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8223",8778,"white smock, which was flecked with blood all about, and her face was wan","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8224",8778,"and pined, and the tears began to run when she saw me, but no word came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8225",8778,"from her lips though the kissing of them was sweet.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8226",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8227",8778,"Then I turned about to my two fellows, and they stood bewildered, not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8228",8778,"knowing what was toward; and I came to them and made them drink of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8229",8778,"flasket, and their eyes were opened and the strength of giants came to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8230",8778,"them, and they ran each to his sweetling; but Baudoin, before ever he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8231",8778,"kissed Aurea, caught hold of the chain that bound her to the pillar, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8232",8778,"by main force dragged it out.  Wise was that, meseemed, for words were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8233",8778,"again come into the witch’s howls, and I heard her: Ah, long may ye be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8234",8778,"playing with the chains, long! for now the house rumbleth toward its","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8236",8778,"she howled wordless, as both I and Arthur had our loves in our arms, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8237",8778,"fell to following Baudoin out on to the perron and down into the fresh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8239",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8240",8778,"Stood we then aloof from the house, and the rumbling whereof the evil hag","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8242",8778,"walls and gold-adorned roofs fell together, and a great cloud of dust","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8243",8778,"rose under the clear moonlit sky.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8244",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8248",8778,"sort and such wise as I will not tell you.  Then I did the same by Aurea","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8249",8778,"and Atra, and forthwith the speech flowed from them to their friends.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8253",8778,"their bodies had suffered of the foul witch, and made their eyes bright,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8257",8778,"Now when we had stood gazing toward the melting of the beauteous palace","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8258",8778,"for a little, we took our darlings in our arms again, whereas the chains","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8259",8778,"would have hindered their walking, and went down to the lip of the water","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8261",8778,"of need; for we knew not what might betide the isle now its mistress had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8262",8778,"perished.  Then we fell to and sawed off the chains from the dear ankles","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8263",8778,"with our swords, and took Birdalone’s lendings from the mail.  And Aurea","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8264",8778,"had her gown again, and Viridis her smock, and my green surcoat over it,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8266",8778,"feet (for Atra would not have hers dight prouder than her sisters’), we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8287",8778,"the last of you, dear Birdalone, that early morning, we turned back again","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8288",8778,"to the house as speedily and as covertly as we might, lest the witch","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8289",8778,"might espy our disarray and question us thereover.  Then we went to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8290",8778,"wonder-coffer, and gat thereout raiment for that which we had given away,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8291",8778,"which was easy for us to do, whereas the witch-mistress was so slothful","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8292",8778,"that she had given to us the words of might wherewith to compel the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8294",8778,"to move hand or foot in the matter.  So when we were clad, and the time","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8295",8778,"was come, we went into the hall, by no means well assured of our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8297",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8298",8778,"When we came before her, she looked on us in surly wise, as her wont was,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8299",8778,"and said nought for a while; she stared on us and knit her brows, as if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8300",8778,"she strove to call to mind something that ran to and fro in her memory;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8302",8778,"at last: Meseemeth as if there is a woman in the isle besides you three;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8303",8778,"some misdoer that I was minded to punish.  Tell me, you! was there not a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8304",8778,"naked one who came into this hall a while ago, one whom I threatened with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8305",8778,"pining?  Atra, who was the boldest of us, bowed the knee before her, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8306",8778,"said: Nay, our lady, since when do stranger women come naked into thine","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8316",8778,"one whom a while ago ye had stripped and tied to a pillar here, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8320",8778,"thrums of some memory, and then her face became smooth again, and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8321",8778,"spake lightly: All that may well be; so do ye go about your due service,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8322",8778,"and trouble Our rest here no longer; for We love not to look on folk who","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8330",8778,"came before long.  The days wore heavily, nor kept we count of them lest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8331",8778,"we should lose heart for the weariness of waiting.  But on a day as we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8332",8778,"stood on the steps of the perron and served my lady with dainties, of a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8333",8778,"hot afternoon, came two great white doves a-flying, who pitched down","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8334",8778,"right before our mistress’s feet; and each had a gold ring about his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8335",8778,"neck, and a scroll tied thereto, and the witch bade us take the doves and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8336",8778,"take off the scrolls and give them unto her; and she looked on the gold","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8337",8778,"rings which the doves bore, and for a moment on the scrolls, and then she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8338",8778,"said: Take ye the doves and cherish them, lest We have need of them; take","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8339",8778,"also the two scrolls and keep them till to-morrow morning, and then give","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8340",8778,"them into Our hands.  And look ye to this, that if ye give them not unto","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8341",8778,"Us it will be treason against Us, and We shall have a case against you,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8343",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8344",8778,"Then she rose up slowly, and bade me to her that she might lean upon my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8345",8778,"shoulder and be helped upstairs, so slothful a beast as she was; and as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8346",8778,"we went up I heard her say softly to herself: Weary on it, now must I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8347",8778,"drink a sup of the Water of Might, that I may remember and do and desire.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8348",8778,"But dear is my sister, and without doubt she hath matters of import to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8349",8778,"tell me by these doves.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8350",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8351",8778,"So when we were together alone I told the others hereof, and we talked it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8352",8778,"over; and they deemed the tidings ill, even as I did; for we might not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8353",8778,"doubt but that the doves were a sending from the witch-sister who dwelt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8354",8778,"at the House under the Wood; and sore we misdoubted that they were sped","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8355",8778,"to our mistress to tell her of thee, Birdalone, and mayhappen of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8356",8778,"Quest, so wise as we knew she was.  As to the two scrolls, forsooth, they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8357",8778,"were open, and not sealed; but when we looked on them we could make","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8358",8778,"nought of it; for though they were writ fairly in Latin script, so that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8359",8778,"we read them, yet of the words no whit might we understand, so we feared","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8360",8778,"the worst.  But what might we do? we had but two choices, either to cast","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8361",8778,"ourselves into the water, or abide what should befall; and this last one","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8362",8778,"we chose because of the hope of deliverance.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8363",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8364",8778,"Next morning, therefore, we came before our mistress in the hall, and we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8365",8778,"found her pacing up and down before the dais; though her wont was at that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8366",8778,"hour to be sitting in her throne of gold and ivory, lying back on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8367",8778,"cushions half asleep.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8368",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8369",8778,"So Atra went up to her, and knelt before her and gave her the scrolls,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8370",8778,"and she looked on her grimly, and smiled evilly, and said: Kneel there","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8371",8778,"yet; and ye others kneel also, till I see what befitteth you.  So did we,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8372",8778,"and indeed I was fain to kneel, for I might scarce stand up for terror;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8373",8778,"and all of us, our hearts died within us.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8374",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8375",8778,"But the witch read those scrolls to herself, sitting in her throne, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8376",8778,"spake not a long while; then she said: Come hither, and grovel before Us,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8377",8778,"and hearken!  Even so we did; and she said again: Our sister, who hath","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8378",8778,"been so kind unto you, and saved you from so many pains, here telleth Us,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8379",8778,"by the message of the two doves, that ye have betrayed Us and her, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8380",8778,"have stolen her thrall and her Sending Boat, and sent her an errand for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8381",8778,"Our destruction; and therewith she delivereth you into Our hands, and ye","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8382",8778,"are Ours henceforward; nor is it to be thought that ye may escape Us.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8383",8778,"Now, for your treason, some would slay you outright here and now, but We","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8384",8778,"will be merciful, and let you live, and do no more than chastise you","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8385",8778,"sharply now; and thereafter shall ye be Our very thralls to do as We will","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8386",8778,"with: thereafter, that is to say, when they whom ye have sent Our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8387",8778,"sister’s thrall to fetch have come hither (as belike I may scarce stay","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8388",8778,"them), and I have foiled them and used them, and sent them away empty.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8389",8778,"Now I tell you, that meanwhile of their coming shall ye suffer such","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8390",8778,"things as We will; and when they be here We will not forbid you to be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8391",8778,"anigh them; but We shall see that there will be little joy to you in that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8392",8778,"nighness.  Yea, ye shall know now to what market ye have brought your","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8397",8778,"to those three pillars of the hall whereas ye found us chained; and we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8398",8778,"were fed as dogs be, and served as dogs, but we endured all for the sake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8399",8778,"of hope; and when we durst, and deemed the witch would not hear us, we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8400",8778,"spake together and enheartened each other.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8401",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8402",8778,"But on the fourth day of our torment came the witch to us, and gave us to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8403",8778,"drink a certain red water from out of a leaden flasket; and when I drank","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8404",8778,"I deemed it was poison, and was glad, if gladness might be in me at such","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8405",8778,"a tide; and when I had drunk I felt an icy chill go through all my body,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8406",8778,"and all things swam before my eyes, and deadly sickness came over me.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8407",8778,"But that passed away from me presently, and I felt helpless and yet not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8408",8778,"feeble; all sounds heard I clearer than ever yet in my life; also I saw","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8409",8778,"the hall, every arch and pillar and fret, and the gleam on the pavement","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8410",8778,"from the bright sun that might not enter; and the witch I saw walking up","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8411",8778,"and down the hall by the dais; but my sisters I saw not when I looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8412",8778,"across to their pillars.  Moreover, I might not see myself when I reached","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8413",8778,"out my hand or my foot, though I saw the chain which made my ankle fast","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8414",8778,"to the pillar; and withal, when I set my hand on my face, or any other","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8415",8778,"part of my body, or what else I might touch, I felt there what I looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8419",8778,"Now I knew scarce if I were alive or dead, or if I were but beginning to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8420",8778,"be dead; but there came upon me the desire of life, and I strove to cry","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8421",8778,"out to the sisters, but though I formed the words in my mouth, and did","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8422",8778,"with my throat as when one cries out aloud, yet no sound of a voice came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8426",8778,"body felt such fear of her that I knew I was not dead.  Then she came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8427",8778,"before me and said: O shadow of a thrall, whom none can see but them unto","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8428",8778,"whom wisdom hath given eyes to see wonders withal, now have I tidings for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8429",8778,"thee and thy sisters, to wit, that your lovers and seekers are at hand;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8430",8778,"and presently I shall bring them into this hall, and they shall be so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8431",8778,"nigh unto you that ye might touch them if I did not forbid it; but they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8432",8778,"shall not see you, but shall wonder where I have hidden you, and shall go","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8433",8778,"seeking you to-day and many days, and shall find you not at all.  So make","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8434",8778,"ye the most of the sight of them, for in them henceforward ye have no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8436",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8437",8778,"Therewith she spat out at me, and went over to my sisters, and said words","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8438",8778,"of like import to those which she had said unto me.  And presently she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8439",8778,"went out of the hall; and not long afterwards I heard voices speaking on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8440",8778,"the perron, and knew one for the voice of the witch, and the other for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8441",8778,"the voice of my lord Baudoin; and then again wore a little while, and I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8442",8778,"saw the witch come through the great door of the hall leading Sir Arthur","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8443",8778,"by the hand, as if she were his dear friend, and Baudoin and Hugh, my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8444",8778,"man, following them.  And the said witch was clad full fair, and had laid","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8445",8778,"by her sloth and stupid pride, as meseemed; and her limbs were grown","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8446",8778,"rounder and sleeker, and her skin fairer, so that to them that knew her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8447",8778,"not she might well seem to be a goodly woman.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8448",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8449",8778,"Now they sat to meat as my man hath told you, and then departed from the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8450",8778,"hall, and the witch also.  But after a while she came back again and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8451",8778,"loosed us, and grimly bade us go with her, and needs must we, though we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8452",8778,"could not so much as see our own feet upon the floor.  And she set us to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8453",8778,"tasks about the house, and stood by while we toiled for her, and mocked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8454",8778,"us not without stripes, and in all ways was as rough and cruel and hard","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8455",8778,"with us as she had been smooth and debonair to our lords; but after noon","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8456",8778,"she brought us back and chained us to our pillars again.  And when the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8457",8778,"evening came and the banquet was, it was we who were the unseen players","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8458",8778,"of the string-play; and we might play no other melody than what the witch","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8459",8778,"bade us; else belike, could we have held converse, we might have played","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8460",8778,"such tunes as would have smitten the hearts of our loves, and told them","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8461",8778,"that we were anigh.  To make a short story of it, thus did she day by","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8462",8778,"day, and no comfort or converse might we sisters have of each other, or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8463",8778,"of aught else save the sight of our beloved ones, and a glimmer of hope","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8464",8778,"therewith.  And, forsooth, for as grievously as my heart was wrung by the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8465",8778,"yearning of me for my love, yet was it a joy unto me to think that he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8466",8778,"went there desiring me, and that whom he desired was not the poor","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8467",8778,"wretched creature chained there in her nakedness, with her body spoiled","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8468",8778,"by torment and misery, but the glad maiden whom he had so often called","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8469",8778,"fair and lovesome.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8470",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8471",8778,"So passed the days, and at last hope had grown so pale and wan, that she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8472",8778,"was no more to be seen by us than we were by our lords; and now it seemed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8473",8778,"to me that death was coming, so feeble and wretched as I grew.  But the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8474",8778,"witch would not let us die, but sustained us from time to time with some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8475",8778,"little draughts of a witch-drink that revived us.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8476",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8477",8778,"So wore the time till that evening, when came hope together with the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8478",8778,"fulfilment of hope, so that one minute we durst hope for deliverance, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8479",8778,"the next we were delivered.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8480",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8481",8778,"Nor is there more to tell, Birdalone, my dear, save that we came safely","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8482",8778,"to the Isle of the Young and the Old in the full morning-tide; and as our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8483",8778,"ferry drew nigh the green shore, there were the two younglings whereof","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8484",8778,"thou didst tell us awaiting our landing, and when we stepped ashore they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8485",8778,"came to us bearing cakes and fruit in a fair basket, and they made much","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8486",8778,"of us and we of them.  And so we came to the old man, who was exceeding","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8487",8778,"fain of us, and grand and courteous, till he became a little drunk, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8488",8778,"then he was somewhat over-kind to us women.  Nevertheless, there in that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8489",8778,"pleasant isle we rested us for three days, that we might somewhat calm","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8490",8778,"and refresh our spirits with what was small and of little account.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8491",8778,"when we departed, the old man followed us down to the strand, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8492",8778,"lamented our departure, as he had done with our lords erewhile; only this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8493",8778,"time yet greater was his lamentation, and needs must we kiss him, each","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8494",8778,"one of us, or never had he been done.  So he turned up landward,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8495",8778,"bewailing the miss of us, but presently, before we had seen the last of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8496",8778,"him, was cheerful again and singing.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8497",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8498",8778,"So we went on our way; and we also, we maidens, in our turn, saw those","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8499",8778,"woeful images of the Isle of Queens and the Isle of Kings; and we came to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8500",8778,"the Isle of Nothing, and abode warily by our ferry, and so came away","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8501",8778,"safe, and thus, as thou wottest, home to the castle to hear evil tidings","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8525",8778,"men were of the choicest, both of knights and sergeants and archers.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8526",8778,"There then they held a mote without the castle, whereas Arthur the Black","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8530",8778,"Now this while Birdalone had seen but little of Arthur, who was ever busy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8531",8778,"about many matters, and never had she had any privy talk with him, though","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8532",8778,"sore she longed for it; yet indeed it was more by her will than his that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8533",8778,"so it was.  But when it was come to the very last day before the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8534",8778,"departure, she said that she must needs see him before he went, and he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8535",8778,"perchance never to come back again.  So when men were quiet after dinner","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8536",8778,"she went into the hall and found him there, pacing up and down the floor.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8537",8778,"For indeed she had sent a word to him by Leonard the priest that he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8538",8778,"should be there.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8539",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8540",8778,"So she went up to him, and all simply she took him by the hand and led","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8541",8778,"him into a shot-window and set him down by her; and he, all trembling for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8542",8778,"love and fear of her, might not forbear, but kissed her face and her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8543",8778,"mouth many times; and she grew as hot as fire, and somewhat she wept.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8544",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8545",8778,"Then she spake after a while: Dear friend, I had it in my mind to say to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8546",8778,"thee many things that meseems were sage, but now neither will the thought","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8553",8778,"to-morrow as it was when ye were away upon the Quest, and I knew not how","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8554",8778,"to bear myself, so heavy lay all the world and its doings and its fashion","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8555",8778,"upon me?  It will be hard to me, he said; evil and grim will be the days.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8556",8778,"She said: And yet, even now in these last days, when I see thee oft,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8557",8778,"every day my soul is worn with grief, and I know not what to do with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8558",8778,"myself.  I shall come back, he said, and bear my love with me, and then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8559",8778,"belike we shall seek some remedy.  She was silent a while, and then she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8560",8778,"said: Meanwhile of thy coming, and I see thee not at all for many days,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8561",8778,"how will it be with my grief then?  Quoth he: More than enough of grief","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8562",8778,"no soul may bear; for either death comes, or else some dullness of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8563",8778,"pain, and then by little and little the pain weareth.  Then she said: And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8564",8778,"how would it be if thou come not back and I see thee never again, or if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8565",8778,"when thou come back thou find me not, for that I be either dead or gone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8566",8778,"away out of thy reach?  He said: I know not how it would be.  When thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8567",8778,"sayest thou shalt die, dost thou wholly believe it in thy sense or thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8568",8778,"body otherwise than Holy Church would?  I will tell thee, she said, that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8569",8778,"now I am sitting by thee and seeing thy face and hearing thy voice, it is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8570",8778,"that only which I believe in; for I may think of nought else of either","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8571",8778,"grief or joy.  Yea, when I wept e’en now, it was not for sorrow that I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8572",8778,"wept, but for I cannot rightly tell what.  And she took his hand and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8573",8778,"looked fondly upon him.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8576",8778,"twain are grown to be such close friends that I may ask thee what I will,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8577",8778,"and thou be neither angry, nor wonder thereat.  I see on thy finger here","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8578",8778,"the ring that I brought with me from the Isle of Increase, and which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8579",8778,"thereafter thou hadst of me when I gave thee back also the shoon which","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8584",8778,"confusion, and maybe fear.  But now will I answer thee.  For even in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8585",8778,"those hours which we wore on the Isle of the Young and the Old, when all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8587",8778,"or indeed, why do I not say it out, all thereof.  And she spake to me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8588",8778,"such words (for she is both tender and wise and strong of heart) that I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8592",8778,"of my grief for her grief.  See now, love, since I have answered thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8608",8778,"than the witch’s stripes, and I kept thinking to myself: How simple was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8615",8778,"her lips: This, forsooth, was the cause that I looked grim on thee:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8618",8778,"forth of thee to the Black Valley, whereof came the slaying of Baudoin,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8619",8778,"seemed unto me a mere folly, till again I had heard thy tale of that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8620",8778,"also; and then the tale and thy speech overcame me.  But again, though I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"8622",8778,"speedily, but then there was this also which would not let my soul rest,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8623",8778,"to wit, that I feared concerning that slain knight whose head the Red One","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8624",8778,"had hung about thy neck; for how else, methought, might he have been so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"8625",8778,"wroth with him and thee; and meseemed, moreover, that thou wert kind in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9118",8778,"So they rode down into the frank, and entered the gates of the city a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9119",8778,"little after noon, and again was Birdalone in all amaze at the going to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9120",8778,"and fro in the streets and the thronging of the markets, and the divers","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9121",8778,"folk, as chapmen and men-at-arms, and craftsmen and lords, who used the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9122",8778,"said city; and to say sooth, somewhat her heart sank within her, and it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9123",8778,"seemed to her that it would be hard and troublous to have to deal with so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9124",8778,"much folk, and that they must needs go past her on the right hand and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9125",8778,"left without heeding her life.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9126",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9127",8778,"Howsoever, Gerard, who knew the city, brought her to a fair hostel, where","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9128",8778,"she was well lodged, she and her men.  Straightway, then, before she went","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9129",8778,"out into the streets again, she fell to getting together what she had of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9130",8778,"fine broidered work and of fair script, and to finishing what she had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9131",8778,"unfinished.  And she sent forth Gerard and his sons to find out where was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9132",8778,"the market for such goods, and if she would have leave to sell the same","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9133",8778,"therein, or anywhere in the town; and Gerard found the hall of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9134",8778,"embroiderers, and therein the master of the craft, and he received the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9135",8778,"carle courteously when he heard that there was fine work come to town,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9136",8778,"and did him to wit that none in any such craft might have freedom of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9137",8778,"market save by leave of the guild of the craft; but, said he, the guilds","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9138",8778,"were open-handed and courteous, and were nowise wont to refuse the said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9139",8778,"leave, were the work good and true; and he bade Gerard withal tell his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9140",8778,"mistress that she were best to bring samplings of her work to the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9141",8778,"Guildhall so soon as she might.  So the very next day went Birdalone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9142",8778,"thither, and found the master a well-looked tall man of some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9143",8778,"five-and-forty winters, who looked on her from the first as if he deemed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9144",8778,"it were no ill way of wearing the time.  To this man she showed her work,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9145",8778,"and though he found it not easy to take his eyes off Birdalone herself,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9146",8778,"yet when he looked at her handiwork, he found it better than very good,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9147",8778,"and he said to her: Damsel, here is what will be sought for at a great","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9148",8778,"price by the great lords and ladies of the land, and the rich burgesses,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9149",8778,"and especially by the high prelates; and so much of it as thou hast a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9150",8778,"mind to do is so much coined gold unto thee; and now I see thee what thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9151",8778,"art, I were fain that thou gathered good to thee.  But as diligent as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9152",8778,"thou mayst be, thou hast but one pair of hands, wonderful soothly, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9153",8778,"yet but one pair.  He broke off at that word, for he was verily staring","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9154",8778,"at her hands, and longing to see more of her arms than the wrists only,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9155",8778,"so that he scarce knew what he was saying.  Then he turned red and said:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9156",8778,"Soothly I wot that no other hands save thine may do such needlework, or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9157",8778,"make the draughts for them.  But thou wilt need women-servants to help","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9158",8778,"thee, both in dighting the house for thee (for this big old carle here","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9159",8778,"will be scarce meet thereto) and as apprentices to help thee about the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9160",8778,"work itself; and if thou wilt, I shall seek the best ones out for thee.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9161",8778,"Moreover I must tell thee, that though I know for sure how that no woman","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9162",8778,"in the world may work such needlework as thine, yet whiles there cometh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9163",8778,"hither a woman of middle age, a woman worn by troubles, pious, meek, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9164",8778,"kind; and by St. Lucia! now I look on thee again, she might be somewhat","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9165",8778,"like unto thee, were she young and fresh-looking and strong as thou art.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9166",8778,"Now this woman I say, and thereat I marvel, doeth needlework that is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9167",8778,"somewhat after the manner of thine, and which seemed to us excellent till","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9168",8778,"I had seen thine.  Good livelihood she earneth thereby, and is diligent","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9169",8778,"therein; but she hath no heart to get apprentices, or be made one of our","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9170",8778,"guild, both of which were lawful to her as to thee, lovely damsel.  But","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9171",8778,"now I shall counsel her to be made of our guild along with thee, if thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9172",8778,"wilt have it so, and then may ye both have three apprentices each, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9173",8778,"may make in our city a goodly school, so that our guild shall be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9174",8778,"glorified thereby, for there will be none such work in the world.  How","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9175",8778,"sayest thou?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9176",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9177",8778,"She thanked him much, and yeasaid him, and thought in her heart that such","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9178",8778,"work which would keep her hands and her head both busy, would solace the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9179",8778,"grief of her heart, and wear away the time, that she might live till hope","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9180",8778,"might peradventure arise in her.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9181",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9182",8778,"Then said the master: There is one thing else, that is, thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9183",8778,"dwelling-place; and if thou wilt I shall hire thee a house in the street","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9184",8778,"of the Broiderers, a goodly one: sooth to say, that same is mine own, so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9185",8778,"thou mayst deem that I tell thee hereof to mine own gain; and that may be","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9186",8778,"(and he reddened therewith); but there is this in it, that if thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9187",8778,"lackest money I shall let thee live therein without price till thou shalt","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9188",8778,"have earned more than enough to pay me.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9189",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9190",8778,"Birdalone thanked him well, but she did him to wit that she was nowise","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9191",8778,"penniless; and presently she departed well pleased, though she deemed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9192",8778,"that the said master was well-nigh more friendly than might be looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9193",8778,"for.  And the next day he came to her in the hostelry, and without more","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9194",8778,"ado brought her to the house in the street of the Broiderers, and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9195",8778,"found it fair and well plenished, and so she fell to work to get all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9196",8778,"things ready.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9197",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9198",8778,"Now the next week was the day appointed when she should be received into","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9199",8778,"the broiderers’ guild, and the day before came the master aforesaid to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9200",8778,"see Birdalone.  Sooth to say, he had not failed to come to see her every","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9201",8778,"day, on one pretence or another, since the first day they had met, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9202",8778,"ever he did to her with all honour and simply.  But on this day he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9203",8778,"brought with him the woman skilful of her hands, to show her unto","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9204",8778,"Birdalone, who received her gladly, and thereafter Master Jacobus left","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9205",8778,"them alone together.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9206",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9207",8778,"The said woman looked worn and aged indeed, but was not of more than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9208",8778,"five-and-forty winters even by seeming, after the first look at her; she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9209",8778,"was somewhat tall and well-knit, her face well shapen, and her hair yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9210",8778,"goodly.  There was a kind look in the eyes of her, as if she might love","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9211",8778,"anyone with whom she lived that would be kind to her.  Meek, or rather","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9212",8778,"over-meek, of mien she was, and it seemed of her that she had been sore","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9213",8778,"scared and oppressed one while or another.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9214",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9215",8778,"So when Master Jacobus was gone, Birdalone set her down on the settle","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9216",8778,"beside her, and spake to her full sweetly and kindly, and the woman spake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9217",8778,"little in turn save answering simply to her questions.  Birdalone asked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9218",8778,"where she was kinned, and she answered: In Utterhay.  Then said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9219",8778,"Birdalone: Within these last few days I have heard that town named twice","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9220",8778,"or thrice, and never before, as meseemeth; and yet, hearing the name from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9221",8778,"thy mouth, it seemeth to stir something in me, as if I had been there one","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9222",8778,"time and longed to be there again.  Is there aught in the place whereof","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9223",8778,"folk tell wide about, so that I might have heard it told of and not noted","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9224",8778,"it at the time?  Nay, lady, said the dame, save perchance that it is on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9225",8778,"the verge of a very great and very evil wood, otherwise it was once a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9226",8778,"merry town and of much resort from the country-side.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9227",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9228",8778,"Birdalone looked on her, and saw that the tears were coming from her eyes","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9229",8778,"and running down her cheeks as she spake; so she said to her: Why dost","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9230",8778,"thou weep, mother?  Is there aught I may do to assuage thy grief?  Said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9231",8778,"the dame: Thou art so kind to me, and thy voice is so dear and sweet,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9232",8778,"that I cannot choose but weep.  Meseems it is because love of thee hath","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9233",8778,"taken mine heart, and therewith is blended memory of past sorrow of mine.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9234",8778,"Thou askest me if thou mayest do aught to assuage my grief; dear lady, I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9235",8778,"am not grieved now, that has gone by; nay, now I am more than not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9236",8778,"grieved, I am made happy, because I am with thee.  But since thou art so","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9237",8778,"debonair with me, I will ask thee to do somewhat for me; and that is, to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9238",8778,"tell me of thy life gone by; I mean, sweet young damsel, of thy life when","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9239",8778,"thou wert a little child.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9240",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9241",8778,"Then Birdalone kissed her and said: It goes to my heart that thou lovest","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9242",8778,"me; for soon as I set eyes on thee my heart went out to thee; and now","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9243",8778,"belike we shall be dear friends; and that is a thing that shall avail me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9244",8778,"much, to have a friend who is so much older than I, so that nought can","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9245",8778,"come between us, of the love of men and other griefs.  Yea, now, said the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9246",8778,"dame, smiling somewhat sadly; now do I see the water standing in thine","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9247",8778,"eyes, and thy voice quavers.  Is it so, thou lovely kind damsel, that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9248",8778,"thou hast been grieved by love of a man?  Who then may prevail in love if","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9249",8778,"thou prevail not?  And she fell to fondling Birdalone’s hand; but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9250",8778,"Birdalone said: It is over-long to tell of all my life, mother, though I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9251",8778,"be so young; but now I will do as thou badest me, and tell thee somewhat","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9252",8778,"of my days when I was little.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9253",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9254",8778,"And therewith she fell to telling her of her days in the House under the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9255",8778,"Wood, and the witch and her surliness and grimness, and of her love of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9256",8778,"the wild things, and how she waxed there.  And she spake a long while,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9257",8778,"for the memory of those days seemed to lead her along, as though she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9258",8778,"verily were alive now in them; and the woman sat before her, gazing on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9259",8778,"her lovingly, till Birdalone stayed her tale at last and said: Now have I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9260",8778,"told thee more than enough of a simple matter, and a life that was as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9261",8778,"that of a wild creature of the woods.  Now shalt thou, mother, tell me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9262",8778,"somewhat of thee, and what was thy grief of Utterhay: for thou shalt find","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9263",8778,"that the telling thereof shall solace thee.  Ah! so think young folk,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9264",8778,"said the woman sadly, because there are many days left for them to hope","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9265",8778,"in.  But though the telling of my sorrow be a fresh sorrow to me, yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9266",8778,"shalt thou hear it.  It is but of the loss of my babe; but she was of all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9267",8778,"babes the fairest and the sweetest.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9268",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9269",8778,"Then she fell to telling Birdalone all that concerning the witch at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9270",8778,"Utterhay and the poor-wife that ye have heard in the beginning of this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9271",8778,"book, until the time when she left the house to buy meat for the witch;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9272",8778,"for she herself was the said poor-wife.  And then she told how she came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9273",8778,"back again and found her guest gone and the child withal; and though she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9274",8778,"had wept for love of Birdalone, she wept not at telling of this grief,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9275",8778,"but told it as a tale which had befallen some other one.  And she said:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9276",8778,"And so when I had done running up and down like a wild thing, and asking","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9277",8778,"of the neighbours with lack of breath and fierceness of speech who had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9278",8778,"taken my child away from me; and when I had gone up to the wood and even","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9279",8778,"some way into it, and when I had wandered up and down again, and night","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9280",8778,"was falling, I came back at last again to my poor house so weary with my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9281",8778,"woe, that I scarce knew what had befallen me.  And there upon the board","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9282",8778,"lay the victual and drink which I had brought, and the money which the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9283",8778,"witch had given unto me; and despite of grief, hunger flamed up in me at","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9284",8778,"the sight, and I threw myself on to it and ate and drank, and so came to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9285",8778,"myself, that is, to my grief.  But the next day I ran about hither and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9286",8778,"thither, and wearied folk with my asking and my woe; but it was all of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9287",8778,"none avail.  The child was gone away from me.  There is little more to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9288",8778,"tell of me, sweet lady.  If I were to live, needs must I take the poor","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9289",8778,"price of my little one, to wit, the witch’s money, and deal with folk for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9293",8778,"folk to me, that they were good and piteous, and I lacked not work nor","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9294",8778,"due livelihood; but after a while I wearied of Utterhay, where my dear","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9295",8778,"child should have been running about before my feet; and having by this","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9296",8778,"time gotten a little money together, and being exceeding deft in my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9297",8778,"craft, I came on hither to live, and, praise be to St. Ursula! I have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9307",8778,"those I told thee erst.  A woman took me out of a basket and set me on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9308",8778,"the back of an ass, and I looked about, and I was in a grassy lawn of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9309",8778,"woods; and I saw a squirrel run up a tree-trunk before me, and wind round","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9310",8778,"the tree and hide him; and then I stretched out my hands and cried out to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9311",8778,"him; and then came the woman unto me, and gave me wood-strawberries to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9313",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9314",8778,"Brake out the poor-wife thereat, pale and trembling: Tell me now, my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9315",8778,"child, hast thou any memory of what the woman was who set thee on the ass","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9316",8778,"and gave thee the strawberries?  Birdalone looked on her, and scanned her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9317",8778,"face closely, and then shook her head, and said: Nay, it was not thou,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9318",8778,"mother.  Nay, surely; nay, surely, said the woman; but think again.  Said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9319",8778,"Birdalone, speaking slowly: Was it my mistress then?  She was a tall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9320",8778,"woman, somewhat thin and bony, with goodly red hair and white-skinned,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9321",8778,"but thin-lipped.  Quoth the poor-wife: No, no; it is of no use; nought","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9323",8778,"her other shape belike: therein was she a tall woman, dark-haired,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9324",8778,"hook-nosed, and hawk-eyed, as if of thirty summers; a stark woman.  Hast","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9327",8778,"The woman sprang up and cried out, and was like to have fallen, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9330",8778,"to herself and said: My child, thou sayest do I remember her; how shall I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9347",8778,"and lovely thou hast grown; and thou that wert born in a poor man’s","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9348",8778,"house! no wonder that any should covet thee.  And I, I wonder if ever I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9349",8778,"was as fair as thou art; forsooth many called me fair for a little while;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9350",8778,"and now behold me!  Nay, child and darling, let not thy face grow","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9351",8778,"downcast, for now shall I know nought more of fear and grief; and is it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9522",8778,"bright, and the birds singing in the garden of the house, and in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9523",8778,"street was the sound of the early market-folk passing through the street","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9532",8778,"brought to her mind the thought of the meads, and the streams of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9533",8778,"river, and the woodsides beyond the city; and she fell a-longing for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9536",8778,"bosom and her arms; and she stood up and looked on the fairness of her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9537",8778,"body, and a great desire took hold of her heart that it might be loved as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9538",8778,"it deserved by him whom she desired.  And thus she stood there till she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9539",8778,"became ashamed, and hastened to do on her raiment; but even as she was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9540",8778,"about it, it came upon her that what she had will to do was to seek to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9541",8778,"the Castle of the Quest, and find out where was her love if there he were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9542",8778,"not, and so to seek him the world over till she found him.  And such a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9543",8778,"flood of joy possessed her when she thought this, and so eager to begone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9544",8778,"she was, that she deemed every minute wasted till she were on the road.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9546",8778,"Nevertheless, in a while, when her mind was steadied, she knew that she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9547",8778,"had somewhat to do ere she might be gone, and that here, as oft, it would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9549",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9550",8778,"So she abode a little, and then came into her hall duly dight, and found","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9551",8778,"Gerard and his sons there to serve her; and she brake her fast, and bade","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9553",8778,"and that, and Gerard answered lightly again; but the two Gerardsons","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9554",8778,"looked at one another, as though they would speak and ask a question from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9555",8778,"time to time, but forbore because they durst not.  But Gerard looked on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9556",8778,"them, and deemed he wotted what was in their minds; so at last he spake:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9557",8778,"Our lady, both I, and meseemeth my sons also, deem that there is some","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9558",8778,"tidings toward which are great unto thee; for thine eyes sparkle, and the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9559",8778,"red burns in thy cheeks, and thine hands may not be quiet, nor thy feet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9560",8778,"abide in one place; wherefore I see that thou hast something in thy mind","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9561",8778,"which strives to be forth of it.  Now thou wilt pardon us, our dear lady,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9562",8778,"that we ask concerning this, because it is in our love for thee that we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9563",8778,"speak, lest there be some change toward which shall be a grief to some of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9565",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9568",8778,"you that I was fleeing from my friends; now the change hath betid that I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9569",8778,"would seek them again; and needs must I leave the Five Crafts behind to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9570",8778,"do so.  And moreover there is this ill word to be said, which I will say","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9571",8778,"at once, to wit, that when I am but a little way gone from the Five","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9573",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9574",8778,"All those three sat silent and aghast at that word, and the young men","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9575",8778,"grew pale; but after a while spake Gerard: Our lady most well-beloved,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9583",8778,"done you a wrong in sundering our fellowship; but all I may say hereon is","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9584",8778,"to pray you to pardon me, that I needs must go alone on my quest.  And","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9585",8778,"now what I would have you do, is first of all to fetch hither a notary","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9586",8778,"and scrivener, that he may draw up a deed of gift to you, Gerard and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9593",8778,"livelihood by the work.  But the next work is simple; it is to furnish","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9594",8778,"for me the array of a young man, with such armour as I may easily bear,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9598",8778,"rather than any man; but thou shalt get me also a short bow and a quiver","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9599",8778,"of arrows, for verily these be my proper weapons that I can deal with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9600",8778,"deftly.  Now my last command is that, when all is done, maybe to-morrow,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9670",8778,"lighted down from her horse, and they all, and they lay upon the grass","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9706",8778,"me as thou mightest be.  And this hath partly grieved me the more,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9707",8778,"because it hath eked my longing for thee; and yet it hath comforted me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9841",8778,"departed, leaving it ungarnished of men; and we deem that the cause","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9864",8778,"with it, so that at last she stayed some six miles short of the house,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9865",8778,"and craved shelter at a yeoman’s stead there, which was granted her with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9866",8778,"all kindness; and they made much of her, and she told them her vow of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9878",8778,"heart beat quick, and she was like to fall from her horse, for there came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9879",8778,"into her mind what the townsman had said, that the Black Squire had gone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9893",8778,"after what I have been told of yonder house.  Yea, said he, and art thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9894",8778,"going up thither?  Certes, said she, and why not?  Said he: They are","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9895",8778,"gone, and all gone!  How and whither? said she.  But I must full","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9908",8778,"heard before of thy departure, he was heavy of mood and few-spoken, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9909",8778,"wandered about as one who might find no rest; yet was he not stern with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9910",8778,"Atra, who for her part was no less heavy-hearted: soothly a sad company","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9911",8778,"we were, and it was somewhat better when my Lord Arthur went his ways","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9912",8778,"from us; and indeed eager he was to be gone; and it could be seen of him","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9929",8778,"enter, tell me of Sir Geoffrey of Lea, and why it was that they might not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9932",8778,"as biddeth Holy Church in all wise, but prevailed not against them, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9937",8778,"great hall where they mostly betid, and laid me down there, as whiles I","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9967",8778,"departed, she would have the castle waste, and then she sent them,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9968",8778,"wotting that thereby she would rid her of Sir Geoffrey of Lea; while, on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"9982",8778,"priest, who lagged somewhat behind her speedy feet, cried out unto her:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9983",8778,"Whither wilt thou? what chamber wilt thou visit first?  But she stayed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"9984",8778,"not, and spake to him over her shoulder as she went: Follow me if thou","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10512",8778,"smite Otter, but as it befell Birdalone saw him, and turned round sharp","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10513",8778,"upon him and gat hold of his wrist, and therewith Otter turned also, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10514",8778,"caught the old carle by the nape as he turned away, and put a foot before","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10520",8778,"adventure of the dead ladies up yonder.  She hung her head, and said:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10614",8778,"fifteen.  They cried and crowed merrily when they saw her stand up, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10615",8778,"pressed on her to see her the nearer and to touch her hands or her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10616",8778,"raiment.  They were but little clad, and the younger ones not at all, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10617",8778,"were goodly younglings and merry.  So great was the noise they raised,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10626",8778,"rain when need is, I will give thee to eat; for we have both bread and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10630",8778,"concerning her armour and weapons, and of the fashion of battle, and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10647",8778,"wheat comes up, and we reap it in harvest, and make bread of it; and we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10894",8778,"first came up, and had turned from her, fell to their peevish lowing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10900",8778,"lowing now and again.  Once more Birdalone drew nigher, and spake loudly","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10906",8778,"surely she is dead.  And she put forth her hand and touched her face, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10907",8778,"it was stone-cold; and she found that she was dead beyond any question.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10917",8778,"draught of the sweet warm milk, and then arose and went swiftly into the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10918",8778,"house, and saw nought changed or worsened so far as she could see.  There","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10919",8778,"was her own bed in the corner, and the mistress’s, greater and much","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10920",8778,"fairer, over against it; and the hutch by the door wherein the victual","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10921",8778,"was kept: she opened it now, and found three loaves there on the shelf,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10922",8778,"and a meal-tub down below, and she took a loaf and broke it and fell to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10923",8778,"eating it as she walked about the chamber.  There was her bow standing in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10924",8778,"a nook beside the hutch, and the quiver of arrows hanging on the wall","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10925",8778,"above it.  There was the settle lying athwart from the hearth; and she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10926",8778,"smiled, and fitted her wrists to the back of the carven bear which made","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10933",8778,"drew forth both smocks and coat and laid them on the settle.  Then she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10934",8778,"opened another coffer, and therein were gay and gaudy gowns and gear of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10936",8778,"also, her green gown and shoon which her own hands had broidered.  But","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10937",8778,"she said: Nay, ye have been in ill company, I will wear you not, though","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10943",8778,"for to-day’s work.  And she knit her brow withal, and walked with a firm","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10944",8778,"step out-a-doors and stood a while gazing on the dead corpse of her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10951",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10952",8778,"But she told herself that the work was to be done; so she dragged the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10953",8778,"body away thence, and across the brook, and a little way into the meadow,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10954",8778,"and then she went back and fetched mattock and spade from the outhouse,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10955",8778,"where she knew they lay, and so fell to digging a grave for the corpse of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10957",8778,"the work ere night began to fall on her, and she had no mind to go on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10958",8778,"with her digging by night.  Wherefore she went back into the house, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10959",8778,"lighted candles, whereof was no lack, and made her supper of the bread","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10960",8778,"and the milk; and then sat pondering on her life that had been till the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10961",8778,"passion arose in her bosom, and the tears burst out, and long she wept","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"10982",8778,"bread and milk, and it was then about mid-morning.  Thereafter she went","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10983",8778,"about the house, and saw to the baking of bread, and so out to the meadow","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10984",8778,"to see to the kine and the goats, and then stored the milk for making","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"10985",8778,"butter and cheese, and did in all wise as if she were to dwell long in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11011",8778,"voice: Art thou dead then, as thy mistress is dead? was it not so that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11021",8778,"big serpent, mouldy and hairy, grey and brown-flecked, came forth from","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11022",8778,"under the stern and went into the water and up the bank and so into the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11024",8778,"fear, and when her feet felt life in them, she turned and stole away back","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11025",8778,"again into the merry green mead and the low beams of the sun, pondering","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11034",8778,"come to me; wherefore shall the fire burn yet and the candles be lighted,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11072",8778,"together in the shade of the great tree, and the wood-mother made much of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11083",8778,"fairer, and thy flesh sleeker; lovelier art thou in all wise, and such as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11084",8778,"I have thought of thee during these years, save that thy face is grown","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11085",8778,"wiser and sadder than might be looked for.  Mother, she said, I am grown","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11086",8778,"older than I should be by the tale of the years, for I have had joy and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11087",8778,"grief, and grief and joy, and grief again; and now that the years have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11088",8778,"worn, the grief abideth and the joy hath departed, save this joy of thee","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11089",8778,"and the day of the meeting I have so often thought of.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11094",8778,"all thy tale, as much as thou canst; and all thou canst tell to me, who","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11121",8778,"on her, and said at last and laughed out withal: One thing I must needs","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11122",8778,"say, that thou hast not fetched thee raiment of price from the knighthood","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11123",8778,"and the kings’ houses; or have I not seen thy grey coat of old time,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11124",8778,"while thou wert living amidst the witch’s cruelty?  Yea forsooth, said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11125",8778,"Birdalone; thou needest not to ask this.  Verily not, said Habundia, nor","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11133",8778,"off one or other of thy shoulders.  But now am I at least enough thy","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11140",8778,"beside her and kissed her and said: But now forget all save thy tale, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11141",8778,"tell all as closely as thou mayest, for I would lose nought thereof.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11142",8778,"Yea, said Birdalone; and where shall I begin?  Said Habundia: I know","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11143",8778,"nought thereof save the beginning, that thou fledst away naked and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11144",8778,"escaped the witch; and the ending, to wit, that the Sending Boat failed","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11154",8778,"and said: Now I deem thee my daughter again, whereas thou thankest me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11162",8778,"heard it afore.  Yea and many more things than we can set down did she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11163",8778,"tell, for full filled she was with the wisdom of the wood.  And between","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11520",8778,"shaggy over his face.  Close by his side lay a little harp, and further","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11521",8778,"off a short spear roughly hefted with an ash-staff.  He was beating the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11764",8778,"and came back to the wood-wife; then they two sat down together, and ate","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11765",8778,"and drank while the water rippled at their feet.  But when they were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11766",8778,"done, Birdalone gat her into the cave again, and kissed the sleeping man","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11767",8778,"fondly, and came forth lightly and stood a moment before the wood-wife,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11768",8778,"and said: Tell me this at least, mother, when shall he be there?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11769",8778,"To-morrow quoth the wood-wife; and, for my part, I would keep thee within","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11771",8778,"as strong as the strongest.  Birdalone hung down her head and answered","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11772",8778,"not, but said presently: Farewell, wood-mother, and be thou blessed.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11790",8778,"in a voice which was somewhat weak, but wherein was no passion of rage or","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11791",8778,"woodness: Where am I then? and who art thou, dame?  She said: Thou art in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11829",8778,"hast got it and not I.  But I will tell thee this, that I have seen it on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11846",8778,"and kissed the hem of her gown, and wept.  But she drew him up and looked","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11847",8778,"on him with the merry countenance of a kind old woman, and said: Nay,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11857",8778,"much with the withered branch, what wilt thou with the blossom of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11904",8778,"how she had done wrong here and right there, I was driven half mad by it,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11905",8778,"so that I hastened back to the Red Hold, and became the captain of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11906",8778,"Greenford, to hunt down their scattered foemen; for I said to myself that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11909",8778,"ill men were not slain, but all were driven away from the parts of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11910",8778,"Greenford; and sooth to say they durst not come anywhere nigh where they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11911",8778,"heard of me.  Then became each day like every other, and the thought of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11912",8778,"my hope and my despair ate mine heart out, and I was of no avail unto","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11913",8778,"any.  Now it so happened, amidst my many battles and chases, I had hunted","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11914",8778,"the bands of the Red Hold into the northwest marches of the woodland; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11915",8778,"I noted that even they, howsoever hard bestead, and the worst of men to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11916",8778,"boot, would scarce at the first be driven into the thickets thereof,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11917",8778,"though at last, whether or no they have made covenant with the devils,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11918",8778,"there I know not, they have betaken them to the depths of the wood and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11919",8778,"have borne off women from the dwellings and got children on them, and are","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11920",8778,"like to breed an evil folk.  That then I noted that this Evilshaw was a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11921",8778,"dwelling loathed and desert, and little like it was that any would meddle","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11924",8778,"me to the busy devil of folly; and I also deemed that if I sought for her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11925",8778,"I should not find her; and yet more forsooth, that if I found her she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11928",8778,"have aught to say to me.  So I gat me away from the Red Hold, as I had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11929",8778,"from the Castle of the Quest, and I gave out that I would enter into","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11938",8778,"who was fashioned of the minstrel craft by nature, and who forgathered","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11939",8778,"with me specially, till we became friends, and he was a solace to me,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11940",8778,"with his tales and his songs of a rougher people than I had been wont to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"11943",8778,"till I scarce knew what next I should do.  So I fared away yet deeper","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11944",8778,"into the wildwood, taking with me the harp which my friend had given me","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"11945",8778,"before he died.  It was summer, and I wandered about ever deeper into the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12464",8778,"night, stood still and hearkened, deeming that she could hear some noise","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12465",8778,"that was neither the morning wind in the tree-boughs nor the going of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12466",8778,"wild things anear them in the wood.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12467",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12468",8778,"So she did off her helm to hear the better, and stood thus a little; then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12469",8778,"she turned about and stooped down to Arthur, who was yet sleeping, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12470",8778,"put forth a hand to rouse him.  But or ever she touched him, broke forth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12471",8778,"a sound of big and rough voices and laughter, and amidst it two shrieks","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12472",8778,"as of women.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12473",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12474",8778,"Arthur heard it, and was on his feet in a moment, and helmed, and he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12475",8778,"caught up his bended bow and cast on the quiver (for Birdalone was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12476",8778,"already weaponed), and without more words they went forth swiftly up the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12477",8778,"bank and through the thicket till they were looking on the half-blind","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12478",8778,"way, but under cover, and there was nothing before them as yet.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12479",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12480",8778,"There they stayed and hearkened keenly.  There were no more shrieks of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12481",8778,"women, nor heard they any weapon clash, but the talking and laughter of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12482",8778,"men went on; and at last they heard a huge and grim whoop of many men","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12483",8778,"together; and then thereafter was less sound of talking, but came the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12484",8778,"jingle as of arms and harness; and Arthur whispered in Birdalone’s ear:","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12485",8778,"Stand close! they have gotten to horse, and will be coming our way.  Nock","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12488",8778,"Therewith they heard clearly the riding of men, and in less than five","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12489",8778,"minutes’ space they saw three big weaponed men riding together, clad in","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12490",8778,"red surcoats, and they were so nigh that they heard the words of their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12491",8778,"speech.  One said to the other: How long shall the knight hold out, think","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12492",8778,"ye?  Oh, a week maybe, said the other.  Meseems it was scathe that we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12493",8778,"stayed not a while to pine him, said the first man.  Nay, said the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12494",8778,"second, we be over-heavy laden with bed-gear to tarry.  And they all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12495",8778,"laughed thereat, and so went on out of hearing.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12496",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12497",8778,"But then came four on together, whereof one, a gaunt, oldish man, was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12498",8778,"saying: It is not so much how long we shall be getting there, but what","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12499",8778,"shall betide when we get there.  For this is not like lifting a herd of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12510",8778,"that deal passed on.  And next came a bigger rout, a half score or so,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12511",8778,"and they also laughing and jeering; but amidst them, plain to see riding","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12512",8778,"a-straddle, their ankles twisted together under the horses’ bellies,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12513",8778,"their hands bound behind them, first Atra, black-clad as erst; then","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12514",8778,"Aurea, in a gown of wheat-colour; then Viridis, green-clad.  Atra rode","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12515",8778,"upright, and looking straight before her; Aurea hung her head all she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12516",8778,"might, and her long red hair fell about her face; but Viridis had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12517",8778,"swooned, and was held up in the saddle by one of the caitiffs on each","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12518",8778,"side of her.  They were but little disarrayed, save that some felon had","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12519",8778,"torn the bosom of Viridis’ gown, and dragged down the cloth so that her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12521",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12523",8778,"Birdalone at him who went by Viridis, for she wotted whitherward Arthur’s","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12524",8778,"shaft would be turned.  The loose of the two bows made but one sound;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12525",8778,"both men fell stark dead, and the others huddled together a moment, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12526",8778,"then ran toward the thicket on either hand, and they who ran north, two","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12527",8778,"of them saw not Arthur, because of his green armour, ere they felt the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12528",8778,"death which lay in his sword.  And then he brake out amidst them, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12529",8778,"there were three of them on him, yet for no long while, whereas their","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12530",8778,"weapons bit not on the armour of the Faery, and his woodland blade","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12531",8778,"sheared leather and ring-mail to the flesh and the bone: mighty were his","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12532",8778,"strokes, and presently all three were wallowing on the earth.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12534",8778,"Even therewith the seven who had passed on had turned back and were come","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12535",8778,"on him a-horse-back; and hard had it gone with him, despite of his might","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12536",8778,"and his valour and the trustiness of Habundia’s mail.  But meanwhile","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12537",8778,"Birdalone had run to Viridis, who had fallen a dead weight aside of her","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12538",8778,"horse, and lay half hanging by the bonds of her ankles.  Birdalone","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12539",8778,"swiftly cut the cords both of her feet and her hands, and drew her off","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12540",8778,"her horse as best she might, and laid her down on the grass; and then ran","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12541",8778,"to Arthur sword aloft, just as his new battle was at point to begin.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12542",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12543",8778,"But as she ran it came into her mind in a twinkling that her sword would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12544",8778,"be but weak, and the horn hung about her neck.  Then she stayed her feet,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12545",8778,"and set the horn to her lips and blew; and the oliphant gave forth a long","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12546",8778,"singing note which was strange to hear.  But while it was yet at her lips","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12547",8778,"one of the caitiffs was upon her, and he cried out: Hah the witch, the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12548",8778,"accursed green witch! and fetched her a great stroke from his saddle, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12549",8778,"smote her on the helm; and though his sword bit not on that good","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12550",8778,"head-burg, she fell to the ground unwitting.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12551",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12552",8778,"Yet was not the wood-wife’s promise unavailing, for even while the voice","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12553",8778,"of the horn was in the air, the way and thickets were alive with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12554",8778,"men-at-arms, green-clad as those twain, who straightway fell on the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12555",8778,"caitiffs, and with Arthur to help, left not one of them alive.  Then went","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12556",8778,"some to Viridis, and raised her up, and so dealt with her that she came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12557",8778,"to herself again; and the like they did by Birdalone, and she stood, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12558",8778,"looked about confusedly, but yet saw this, that they had gotten the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12559",8778,"victory.  Some went withal to Aurea, and cut her bonds and took her off","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12560",8778,"her horse and set her on the ground; and she was all bewildered, and knew","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12561",8778,"not where she was.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12562",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12563",8778,"But Arthur, when he saw Birdalone on her feet, and unhurt by seeming,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12564",8778,"went to Atra, and cut her bonds and loosed her, and set her on the earth,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12565",8778,"all without a word, and then stood before her shyly.  Came the colour","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12566",8778,"back into her face therewith, and she flushed red, for she knew him","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12567",8778,"despite his outlandish green war-harness, and she reached out her hand to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12568",8778,"him, and he knelt before her and took her hand and kissed it.  But she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12569",8778,"bent over him till her face was anigh his, and he lifted up his face and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12570",8778,"kissed her mouth.  And she drew aback a little, but yet looked on him","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12571",8778,"earnestly, and said: Thou hast saved my life, not from death indeed, but","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12572",8778,"from a loathsome hell; I may well thank thee for that.  And O, if my","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12573",8778,"thanks might be fruitful to thee!  And her bosom heaved, and the sobs","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12574",8778,"came, and the tears began to run down her cheeks.  And he hung his head","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12575",8778,"before her.  But in a while she left weeping, and turned about her face","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12576",8778,"and looked round the field of deed; and she said: Who is yonder slim","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12577",8778,"green warrior who hath even now knelt down by Viridis?  Is it not a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12578",8778,"woman?  Arthur reddened: Yea, said he; it is Birdalone.  Thy love? she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12579",8778,"said.  He said swiftly: Yea, and thy friend, and this time thy deliverer.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12580",8778,"So it is, she said.  It is five years since I beheld her.  My heart","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12581",8778,"yearns for her; I shall rejoice at the meeting of us.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12582",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12583",8778,"She was silent, and he also a while; then she said: But why tarry we here","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12584",8778,"in idle talk when he is yet bound, and in torment of body and soul; he","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12585",8778,"the valiant, and the kind and the dear brother?  Come, tarry for no","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12586",8778,"question.  And she stepped out swiftly along the green road going","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12587",8778,"westward, and Arthur beside her; and as they went by Viridis, lo! Aurea","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12588",8778,"had wandered unto them, and now was Birdalone unhelmed and kissing and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12589",8778,"comforting her.  Then cried out Atra: Keep up thine heart, Viridis! for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12590",8778,"now we go to fetch thee thy man safe and sound.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12591",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12592",8778,"So they went but a little way on the green road ere they came to Sir Hugh","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12593",8778,"bound hard and fast to a tree-bole, and he naked in his shirt, and hard","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12594",8778,"by lay the bodies of two stout carles with their throats cut; for these","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12595",8778,"honest men and the two felons who had betrayed them were all the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12596",8778,"following wherewith the Green Knight had entered Evilshaw.  And as it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12597",8778,"fell, the traitors had been set to watch while the others slept; and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12598",8778,"sleeping the caitiffs found them, and slew the said men-at-arms at once,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12599",8778,"but bound Hugh to a tree that he might be the longer a-dying; since none","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12600",8778,"looked for any but their own folk to pass by that way.  All this they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12601",8778,"heard afterwards of Hugh.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12602",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12603",8778,"But now the said Hugh heard men going, and he opened his eyes, and saw","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12604",8778,"Atra and a man-at-arms with her; and he cried out: Hah, what is this now,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12605",8778,"sister? a rescue?  Yea, she said, and look thou on the face of the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12606",8778,"rescuer; and there is another hard by, and she is a woman.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12607",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12608",8778,"Therewith was Arthur on him and cutting his bonds, and when he was loose","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12609",8778,"they fell into each other’s arms, and Hugh spake: Now then at last doth","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12610",8778,"life begin for me as I willed it!  And hast thou my sweet she-fellow,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12611",8778,"Birdalone, with thee?  Yea, said Arthur.  How good is that! said Hugh.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12612",8778,"And yet, if it might but be that Baudoin were yet alive for us to seek!","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12613",8778,"Then he laughed and said: These be but sorry garments wherewith to wend","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12614",8778,"along with dear and fair ladies, brother!  Nay, said Arthur, that may","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12615",8778,"soon be amended, for yonder, where sword met sword, lieth raiment","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12616",8778,"abundantly on the grass.  Fie on it! said Hugh, laughing; shall I do on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12617",8778,"me the raiment of those lousy traitors?  Not I, by the rood!  Thou must","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12618",8778,"seek further for my array, dear lad!  So they all laughed, and were glad","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12619",8778,"to laugh together.  But Atra said: It is easier even than that, for thine","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12620",8778,"own fair garments and weapons shall we find if we seek them.  Sooth to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12638",8778,"caressed her sweetly; and then he turned to Birdalone, and spared no sign","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12639",8778,"of friendly love to her; and Arthur, for his part, did so much for Aurea","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12640",8778,"and Viridis.  No long tale there was between them for that while, for","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12641",8778,"they would busk them to be gone.  But first they dug a grave for those","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12646",8778,"speedily found Hugh’s raiment, and his pouch, wherein was money good","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12660",8778,"way and fetched down Hugh and Arthur, and brought them to the ladies, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12671",8778,"what there is to tell, but for the others Viridis took up the tale, as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12681",8778,"after much talk hereof, that Hugh left his possessions and his children","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12683",8778,"folk, and took with him Viridis his wife, and Aurea and Atra, and they","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12684",8778,"set out to seek those twain the world over till they should find them.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12685",8778,"And first by the rede of Atra they fared to Greenford, and there tarried","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12686",8778,"a month, and sought tidings of many, and heard a word here and there","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12687",8778,"whereby they deemed that Birdalone had passed therethrough some little","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12688",8778,"time before.  So they went thence to the Castle of the Quest, and found","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12689",8778,"it in such plight as ye have heard, and it went sore to their hearts to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12690",8778,"behold it and to be there.  But therewithal they happed upon Leonard the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12691",8778,"priest, and he was rejoiced beyond measure to see them, and told them all","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12692",8778,"that ye have heard concerning Birdalone’s coming thither and departing","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12694",8778,"the hall of the castle, and that they came to an end the very day that","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12699",8778,"At these tidings they were sore moved, and they talked the matter over","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12703",8778,"the hands of the witch once more, and thereat were they sore downcast;","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12704",8778,"and yet somewhat it was, that they had heard sure tidings of her; though","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12707",8778,"While they talked this over, Atra, who had been somewhat silent, spake","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12708",8778,"and said: Here are we brought to a stop with the first tidings which we","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12709",8778,"have heard, whereas we know no manner of wending the Great Water.  This","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12710",8778,"seemeth evil, but let us not be cast down, or die redeless.  Ye have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12711",8778,"heard of what sayeth Sir Leonard of these hauntings in the hall, and how","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12712",8778,"that they have come back again, wherefore why should we not sleep in the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12714",8778,"note them well, to see if we may draw any avail from them?  How say ye?","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12715",8778,"For my part I will try the adventure, whatever may come of it.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12717",8778,"Now they all yeasaid it, though Aurea was somewhat timorous, albeit she","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12718",8778,"would not be parted from the others; so when night came there they made","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12719",8778,"their beds and lay down; and the end of it was, that a little before","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12720",8778,"midnight Atra waked the others, and did them to wit that by her deeming","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12721",8778,"something was toward; and presently they were all four as wide awake as","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12722",8778,"ever they were in their lives; and next, without any sound that was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12723",8778,"strange, there came the image of a woman on to the dais, clad in green","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12724",8778,"like to an huntress of ancient days, her feet sandalled, her skirts","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12725",8778,"gathered up into her girdle, so that her legs were naked; she had a","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12727",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12728",8778,"Now to all of them save Atra this appearance seemed to be the image of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12730",8778,"to be altogether Birdalone, but rather some other one most like unto her,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12732",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12733",8778,"Gazed the image kindly and sweetly on them, so that they beheld it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12736",8778,"as that the sense of words reached the minds of them.  And this was the","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12737",8778,"tale of it: Ye, who are seeking the lost, have done well to come hither,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12738",8778,"and now shall ye do well to wend the straightest way to the dwelling of","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12740",8778,"forest.  Greenford is on the way.  Way-leaders ye shall get; be wise, yet","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12741",8778,"not prudent, and take them, though they be evil, and your luck may well","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12743",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12744",8778,"Therewith the image vanished away as it had come, and Leonard, who with","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12745",8778,"the others took the appearance for an image of Birdalone, said that it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12746",8778,"was such as he had seen it the three last days.  So they lay not down","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12747",8778,"again, but departed for Greenford without tarrying, and rode the other","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"12749",8778,"would not with them; and Hugh behight him, if he lived and did well, to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12750",8778,"come back somehow to the Castle of the Quest, and so redo it that it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12751",8778,"should be no longer desolate.  So to Greenford they came, and spared not","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12752",8778,"to do folk to wit that they would ride a pilgrimage in Evilshaw, and were","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12753",8778,"fain of way-leaders; and there they dwelt a day or two, and many would","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12754",8778,"let them of that journey, which, said they, was rather deadly than","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12755",8778,"perilous only.  But on the third day came to Sir Hugh two stout carles","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12756",8778,"well weaponed, who said that they knew well all the ways that led to","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12757",8778,"Evilshaw, and the ways that went therethrough, and they offered","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12758",8778,"themselves for a wage to Sir Hugh.  Now these said carles were not over","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12759",8778,"fair of favour, but seemed somewhat of ribalds, nor would Sir Hugh have","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"12760",8778,"taken them to service in his house at home; but he called to mind that it","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"13000",8778,"Hugh and his journey, and how well he should be guarded in the wood both","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"13068",8778,"turned their backs on the Great Water, and came up into the woodland, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13069",8778,"so to the camp in the wood-lawn.  And there had Viridis a joyful meeting","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"13083",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13084",8778,"Said Hugh: Leave ye have, and I shall give you a great reward ere ye go.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13085",8778,"Said the chief of them: Nay, lord, no reward may we take, save a token","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13086",8778,"from thee that thou art content with us.  What token shall it be? said","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13087",8778,"Hugh.  Quoth the way-leader: That each of us kiss the Lady Birdalone on","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13088",8778,"the mouth, for she it is that is verily our mistress under our great","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"13090",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13091",8778,"Laughed Hugh thereat, but the men laughed not; then spake Hugh: This must","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13092",8778,"be at the lady’s own will.  Even so, said they.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"13100",8778,"Now they gather themselves together and go down toward Utterhay, and make","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"13107",8778,"and when he saw this bright company coming forth from the wood, he bade","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13108",8778,"men to him, two score of them, all weaponed, and he did on his armour,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13109",8778,"and rode out-a-gates with them to meet those new-comers; and this he did,","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13110",8778,"not because he did not see them to be but few, but because they came","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13111",8778,"forth out of Evilshaw, and then doubted if they were trustworthy.","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13112",8778,"","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13113",8778,"So he met them two bowshots from the gate, and rode forward till he was","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"13117",8778,"that he had to do with folk of the Faery.  But he spake courteously, and","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
"13118",8778,"said, turning to Hugh, who rode the foremost: Fair sir, would ye tell","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"

"13156",8778,"take me, and if need be, chain me to make surer of me.  And she drew near","The Water of the Wondrous Isles","Morris, William","Fantasy","en"
