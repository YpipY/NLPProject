"1148",903,"sudden scurry of hoofs, and the black man yelled with terror and ran","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"8300",903,"before the other's fiery rush, was upon the very brink, that a general","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"8302",903,"have brought the fight to a bloody end, carried him clear of the edge,","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"8305",903,"through the still green water, sweeping outwards in the swirl of the","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"8306",903,"current. In vain were sword-sheaths, apple-branches and belts linked","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"8307",903,"together thrown out to him by his companions. Alleyne had dropped his","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"8308",903,"shattered sword and was standing, trembling in every limb, with his rage","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"8319",903,"head above water and to make their way out of the current was another","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"8321",903,"last, amid a shout of joy and praise from the bank, they slowly drew","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"14857",903,"even as he hung there another of the hellish stones sang through his","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"14858",903,"curls, and struck a chip from the face of the cliff. Up he clambered","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"14862",903,"swung backwards and forwards until his hand reached the crack, when he","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"14863",903,"left the rope and clung to the face of the cliff. Another stone struck","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"14864",903,"him on the side, and he heard a sound like a breaking stick, with a keen","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"14865",903,"stabbing pain which shot through his chest. Yet it was no time now to","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"14866",903,"think of pain or ache. There was his lord and his eight-score comrades,","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"14869",903,"his weight upon his arms, at others finding some small shelf or tuft","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
"14870",903,"on which to rest his foot. Would he never pass over that fifty feet? He","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"14872",903,"the cliff, his fingers clutching, his feet scraping and feeling for a","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"14874",903,"forever stamped upon his memory. At last, however, his foot came upon","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"

"14899",903,"whirling round, the blood was gushing from his brow, his temple, his","The White Company","Doyle, Arthur Conan","Historical Fiction","en"
