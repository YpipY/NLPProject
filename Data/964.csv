"203",964,"gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts of ale that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"204",964,"he had been quaffing. So, of a sudden, without any warning, he sprang to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"205",964,"his feet, and seized upon his bow and fitted it to a shaft. ""Ay,"" cried","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"206",964,"he, ""and I'll hurry thee anon."" And he sent the arrow whistling after","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"211",964,"arrow whistled within three inches of his head. Then he turned around","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"212",964,"and quickly drew his own bow, and sent an arrow back in return.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"219",964,"the others could gather their wits about them, Robin Hood was gone into","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"220",964,"the depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"226",964,"brightness from everything, for his heart was sick within him, and it","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"227",964,"was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"228",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"238",964,"lasses of sweet Locksley Town; for he was outlawed, not only because he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"239",964,"had killed a man, but also because he had poached upon the King's deer,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"240",964,"and two hundred pounds were set upon his head, as a reward for whoever","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"245",964,"wanted the two hundred pounds, and next, because the forester that Robin","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"247",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"250",964,"other folk for this cause and for that. Some had shot deer in hungry","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"253",964,"been turned out of their inheritance, that their farms might be added to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"254",964,"the King's lands in Sherwood Forest; some had been despoiled by a great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"255",964,"baron or a rich abbot or a powerful esquire--all, for one cause or","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"263",964,"or land rents, or in wrongful fines. But to the poor folk they would","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"264",964,"give a helping hand in need and trouble, and would return to them that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"265",964,"which had been unjustly taken from them. Besides this, they swore never","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"266",964,"to harm a child nor to wrong a woman, be she maid, wife, or widow; so","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"272",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"275",964,"washing his head and hands in the cold brown brook that leaped laughing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"276",964,"from stone to stone. Then said Robin, ""For fourteen days have we seen no","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"284",964,"through highway and byway, through dingly dell and forest skirts. Now he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"285",964,"met a fair buxom lass in a shady lane, and each gave the other a merry","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"286",964,"word and passed their way; now he saw a fair lady upon an ambling pad,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"287",964,"to whom he doffed his cap, and who bowed sedately in return to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2359",964,"long-legged fellow in scarlet! Broad are thy shoulders and thick thy","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2360",964,"head; is not thy lass fair enough for thee to take cudgel in hand for","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2361",964,"her sake? In truth, I believe that Nottingham men do turn to bone and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2362",964,"sinew, for neither heart nor courage have they! Now, thou great lout,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2363",964,"wilt thou not twirl staff for Nottingham?""","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2365",964,"""Ay,"" quoth Little John, ""had I but mine own good staff here, it would","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2366",964,"pleasure me hugely to crack thy knave's pate, thou saucy braggart! I wot","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2367",964,"it would be well for thee an thy cock's comb were cut!"" Thus he spoke,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2368",964,"slowly at first, for he was slow to move; but his wrath gathered headway","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2369",964,"like a great stone rolling down a hill, so that at the end he was full","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2370",964,"of anger.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2371",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2372",964,"Then Eric o' Lincoln laughed aloud. ""Well spoken for one who fears to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2373",964,"meet me fairly, man to man,"" said he. ""Saucy art thou thine own self,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2374",964,"and if thou puttest foot upon these boards, I will make thy saucy tongue","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2377",964,"""Now,"" quoth Little John, ""is there never a man here that will lend me","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2378",964,"a good stout staff till I try the mettle of yon fellow?"" At this, half a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2379",964,"score reached him their staves, and he took the stoutest and heaviest of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2380",964,"them all. Then, looking up and down the cudgel, he said, ""Now, I have in","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2381",964,"my hand but a splint of wood--a barley straw, as it were--yet I trow it","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2382",964,"will have to serve me, so here goeth."" Thereupon he cast the cudgel","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2383",964,"upon the stand and, leaping lightly after it, snatched it up in his hand","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2384",964,"again.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2385",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2386",964,"Then each man stood in his place and measured the other with fell looks","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2388",964,"forth, each grasping his staff tightly in the middle. Then those that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2389",964,"stood around saw the stoutest game of quarterstaff that e'er Nottingham","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2390",964,"Town beheld. At first Eric o' Lincoln thought that he would gain an easy","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2391",964,"advantage, so he came forth as if he would say, ""Watch, good people, how","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2392",964,"that I carve you this cockerel right speedily;"" but he presently found","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2393",964,"it to be no such speedy matter. Right deftly he struck, and with great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2394",964,"skill of fence, but he had found his match in Little John. Once, twice,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2395",964,"thrice, he struck, and three times Little John turned the blows to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2396",964,"left hand and to the right. Then quickly and with a dainty backhanded","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2397",964,"blow, he rapped Eric beneath his guard so shrewdly that it made his head","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2398",964,"ring again. Then Eric stepped back to gather his wits, while a great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2399",964,"shout went up and all were glad that Nottingham had cracked Lincoln's","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2400",964,"crown; and thus ended the first bout of the game.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2402",964,"Then presently the director of the sport cried, ""Play!"" and they came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2403",964,"together again; but now Eric played warily, for he found his man was of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2404",964,"right good mettle, and also he had no sweet memory of the blow that he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2405",964,"had got; so this bout neither Little John nor the Lincoln man caught","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2406",964,"a stroke within his guard. Then, after a while, they parted again, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2409",964,"Then for the third time they came together, and at first Eric strove to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2410",964,"be wary, as he had been before; but, growing mad at finding himself so","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2411",964,"foiled, he lost his wits and began to rain blows so fiercely and so fast","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2412",964,"that they rattled like hail on penthouse roof; but, in spite of all, he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2413",964,"did not reach within Little John's guard. Then at last Little John saw","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2414",964,"his chance and seized it right cleverly. Once more, with a quick blow,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2415",964,"he rapped Eric beside the head, and ere he could regain himself, Little","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2416",964,"John slipped his right hand down to his left and, with a swinging blow,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2417",964,"smote the other so sorely upon the crown that down he fell as though he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2422",964,"gave the staff back to him that had lent it to him. And thus ended the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2426",964,"were to take their places, so the people began flocking to the butts","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2427",964,"where the shooting was to be. Near the target, in a good place, sat the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2428",964,"Sheriff upon a raised dais, with many gentlefolk around him. When the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2429",964,"archers had taken their places, the herald came forward and proclaimed","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"2430",964,"the rules of the game, and how each should shoot three shots, and to him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2437",964,"the people talked among themselves, until at last it reached even the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2520",964,"heard, faint and far away, a distant bugle note sounding thin and clear.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"2524",964,"from its sluggishness, and his memory brought back to him all the merry","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3204",964,"overnight with merry company at the Blue Boar Inn, instead of going","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3205",964,"straight to Ancaster. So, being vexed to his heart by this, he set forth","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3219",964,"right-hand man was in some danger of his life. So cautiously he made his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3220",964,"way through the thickets whence the voices came, and, pushing aside the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"3242",964,"for nigh a half an hour, until the ground was all plowed up with the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"3243",964,"digging of their heels, and their breathing grew labored like the ox in","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"4345",964,"passed along the dusty road in the glare of the sun: now it was a bevy","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"4346",964,"of chattering damsels merrily tripping along; now it was a plodding","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5110",964,"splashing in the shoal, and breaking all the smooth surface into","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5201",964,"out of his mouth, and, gathering his scattered wits together, saw the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5202",964,"stout Friar standing on the bank and laughing. Then, I wot, was Robin","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5225",964,"hour or more, pausing every now and then to rest, at which times each","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5226",964,"looked at the other with wonder, and thought that never had he seen so","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5501",964,"church, where the old friar was still laboring with the great key, the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5504",964,"""Hilloa, brother,"" quoth Tuck, ""let me aid thee."" So saying, he took the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5505",964,"key from the other's hand and quickly opened the door with a turn of it.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5507",964,"""Who art thou, good brother?"" asked the old friar, in a high, wheezing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5508",964,"voice. ""Whence comest thou, and whither art thou going?"" And he winked","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5509",964,"and blinked at stout Friar Tuck like an owl at the sun.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5510",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5511",964,"""Thus do I answer thy questions, brother,"" said the other. ""My name is","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5513",964,"stay while this same wedding is going forward. I come from Fountain Dale","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5515",964,"cell beside the fountain blessed by that holy Saint Ethelrada. But, if","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5516",964,"I understand aught, there is to be a gay wedding here today; so, if thou","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5520",964,"""Truly, thou art welcome, brother,"" said the old man, leading the way","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5521",964,"within. Meantime, Robin Hood, in his guise of harper, together with","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5522",964,"Little John and Will Stutely, had come to the church. Robin sat him down","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5523",964,"on a bench beside the door, but Little John, carrying the two bags of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5524",964,"gold, went within, as did Will Stutely.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5525",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5526",964,"So Robin sat by the door, looking up the road and down the road to see","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5527",964,"who might come, till, after a time, he saw six horsemen come riding","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5528",964,"sedately and slowly, as became them, for they were churchmen in high","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5529",964,"orders. Then, when they had come nearer, Robin saw who they were, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5530",964,"knew them. The first was the Bishop of Hereford, and a fine figure he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5531",964,"cut, I wot. His vestments were of the richest silk, and around his neck","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5532",964,"was a fair chain of beaten gold. The cap that hid his tonsure was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5533",964,"of black velvet, and around the edges of it were rows of jewels that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5534",964,"flashed in the sunlight, each stone being set in gold. His hose were","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5535",964,"of flame-colored silk, and his shoes of black velvet, the long, pointed","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5536",964,"toes being turned up and fastened to his knees, and on either instep was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5537",964,"embroidered a cross in gold thread. Beside the Bishop rode the Prior of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5538",964,"Emmet upon a mincing palfrey. Rich were his clothes also, but not so gay","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5539",964,"as the stout Bishop's. Behind these were two of the higher brethren of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5540",964,"Emmet, and behind these again two retainers belonging to the Bishop; for","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5541",964,"the Lord Bishop of Hereford strove to be as like the great barons as was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5543",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5544",964,"When Robin saw this train drawing near, with flash of jewels and silk","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5545",964,"and jingle of silver bells on the trappings of the nags, he looked","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5546",964,"sourly upon them. Quoth he to himself, ""Yon Bishop is overgaudy for","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5547",964,"a holy man. I do wonder whether his patron, who, methinks, was Saint","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5548",964,"Thomas, was given to wearing golden chains about his neck, silk clothing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5549",964,"upon his body, and pointed shoes upon his feet; the money for all of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5550",964,"which, God wot, hath been wrung from the sweat of poor tenants. Bishop,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5552",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5553",964,"So the holy men came to the church; the Bishop and the Prior jesting and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5554",964,"laughing between themselves about certain fair dames, their words more","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5555",964,"befitting the lips of laymen, methinks, than holy clerks. Then they","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5556",964,"dismounted, and the Bishop, looking around, presently caught sight of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5557",964,"Robin standing in the doorway. ""Hilloa, good fellow,"" quoth he in a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5562",964,"Truly, good Lord Bishop, many a knight and burgher, clerk and layman,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5583",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5584",964,"And now, around the bend of the highroad, came others, riding upon","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5585",964,"horses. The first of all was a tall, thin man, of knightly bearing,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5586",964,"dressed all in black silk, with a black velvet cap upon his head,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5587",964,"turned up with scarlet. Robin looked, and had no doubt that this was Sir","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5588",964,"Stephen, both because of his knightly carriage and of his gray hairs.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5589",964,"Beside him rode a stout Saxon franklin, Ellen's father, Edward of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5590",964,"Deirwold; behind those two came a litter borne by two horses, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5591",964,"therein was a maiden whom Robin knew must be Ellen. Behind this litter","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5592",964,"rode six men-at-arms, the sunlight flashing on their steel caps as they","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5594",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5595",964,"So these also came to the church, and there Sir Stephen leaped from his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5596",964,"horse and, coming to the litter, handed fair Ellen out therefrom. Then","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5597",964,"Robin Hood looked at her, and could wonder no longer how it came about","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5598",964,"that so proud a knight as Sir Stephen of Trent wished to marry a common","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5599",964,"franklin's daughter; nor did he wonder that no ado was made about the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5600",964,"matter, for she was the fairest maiden that ever he had beheld. Now,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5601",964,"however, she was all pale and drooping, like a fair white lily snapped","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5618",964,"hounds on her haunch. Then, in all his fluttering tags and ribbons of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5619",964,"red and yellow, Robin Hood strode forward. Three steps he took from the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"5630",964,"everyone looked at Robin as though they had been changed to stone, he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5631",964,"clapped his bugle horn to his lips and blew three blasts so loud and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5632",964,"clear, they echoed from floor to rafter as though they were sounded by","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5633",964,"the trump of doom. Then straightway Little John and Will Stutely came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"5634",964,"leaping and stood upon either side of Robin Hood, and quickly drew their","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"7060",964,"the forest path until they came to the highway, and then along the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"7061",964,"highway till it split in twain, leading on one hand to Blyth and on the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8408",964,"distant from the mark from which the archers were to shoot stood ten","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8409",964,"fair targets, each target marked by a flag of the color belonging to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8410",964,"band that was to shoot thereat. So all was ready for the coming of the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8416",964,"stout King Henry upon a dapple-gray stallion, with his Queen beside him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8417",964,"upon a milk-white palfrey. On either side of them walked the yeomen of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8418",964,"the guard, the bright sunlight flashing from the polished blades of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8419",964,"the steel halberds they carried. Behind these came the Court in a great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8420",964,"crowd, so that presently all the lawn was alive with bright colors, with","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8421",964,"silk and velvet, with waving plumes and gleaming gold, with flashing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8423",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8424",964,"Then all the people arose and shouted, so that their voices sounded like","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8425",964,"the storm upon the Cornish coast, when the dark waves run upon the shore","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8426",964,"and leap and break, surging amid the rocks; so, amid the roaring and the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8427",964,"surging of the people, and the waving of scarfs and kerchiefs, the King","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8428",964,"and Queen came to their place, and, getting down from their horses,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8429",964,"mounted the broad stairs that led to the raised platform, and there","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8430",964,"took their seats on two thrones bedecked with purple silks and cloths of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8433",964,"When all was quiet a bugle sounded, and straightway the archers came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8435",964,"stalwart a band of yeomen as could be found in all the wide world. So","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8436",964,"they came in orderly fashion and stood in front of the dais where King","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8437",964,"Henry and his Queen sat. King Henry looked up and down their ranks right","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8438",964,"proudly, for his heart warmed within him at the sight of such a gallant","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8439",964,"band of yeomen. Then he bade his herald Sir Hugh de Mowbray stand forth","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8440",964,"and proclaim the rules governing the game. So Sir Hugh stepped to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8441",964,"edge of the platform and spoke in a loud clear voice, and thus he said:","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8442",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8443",964,"That each man should shoot seven arrows at the target that belonged to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8444",964,"his band, and, of the fourscore yeomen of each band, the three that shot","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8445",964,"the best should be chosen. These three should shoot three arrows apiece,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8446",964,"and the one that shot the best should again be chosen. Then each of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8447",964,"these should again shoot three arrows apiece, and the one that shot the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8448",964,"best should have the first prize, the one that shot the next best should","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8449",964,"have the second, and the one that shot the next best should have the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8450",964,"third prize. Each of the others should have fourscore silver pennies for","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8451",964,"his shooting. The first prize was to be twoscore and ten golden pounds,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8452",964,"a silver bugle horn inlaid with gold, and a quiver with ten white arrows","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8453",964,"tipped with gold and feathered with the white swan's-wing therein. The","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8454",964,"second prize was to be fivescore of the fattest bucks that run on Dallen","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8455",964,"Lea, to be shot when the yeoman that won them chose. The third prize was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8461",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8462",964,"And now the shooting began, the captains first taking stand and speeding","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8463",964,"their shafts and then making room for the men who shot, each in turn,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8464",964,"after them. Two hundred and eighty score shafts were shot in all, and so","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8465",964,"deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done each target looked","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8466",964,"like the back of a hedgehog when the farm dog snuffs at it. A long","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8467",964,"time was taken in this shooting, and when it was over the judges came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8468",964,"forward, looked carefully at the targets, and proclaimed in a loud voice","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8469",964,"which three had shot the best from the separate bands. Then a great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8470",964,"hubbub of voices arose, each man among the crowd that looked on calling","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8471",964,"for his favorite archer. Then ten fresh targets were brought forward,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8472",964,"and every sound was hushed as the archers took their places once more.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8474",964,"This time the shooting was more speedily done, for only nine shafts","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8478",964,"judges came forward again, and looking at the targets, called aloud the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"8479",964,"names of the archer chosen as the best bowman of each band. Of these","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8575",964,"carefully each man shot his shafts, and so deep was the silence that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"8988",964,"eating, though it seemed as though they never would have ended, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9072",964,"Lincolnshire, to the good town of Gainsborough. Then, striking to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9086",964,"days it took him to journey thus far, and then he thought he had gotten","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9087",964,"far enough to the north, so, turning toward the eastward, shunning the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9088",964,"main roads, and choosing byways and grassy lanes, he went, by way of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9089",964,"Litchfield and Ashby de la Zouch, toward Sherwood, until he came to a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9092",964,"snuff the spicy air of the woodlands once again. But there is many a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9093",964,"slip betwixt the cup and the lip, and this Robin was to find. For thus","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9096",964,"When the King's men found themselves foiled at Saint Albans, and that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9097",964,"Robin and his men were not to be found high nor low, they knew not what","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9098",964,"to do. Presently another band of horsemen came, and another, until all","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9099",964,"the moonlit streets were full of armed men. Betwixt midnight and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9100",964,"dawn another band came to the town, and with them came the Bishop of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9101",964,"Hereford. When he heard that Robin Hood had once more slipped out of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9102",964,"the trap, he stayed not a minute, but, gathering his bands together, he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9103",964,"pushed forward to the northward with speed, leaving orders for all the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9104",964,"troops that came to Saint Albans to follow after him without tarrying.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9105",964,"On the evening of the fourth day he reached Nottingham Town, and there","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9106",964,"straightway divided his men into bands of six or seven, and sent them","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9107",964,"all through the countryside, blocking every highway and byway to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9108",964,"eastward and the southward and the westward of Sherwood. The Sheriff","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9109",964,"of Nottingham called forth all his men likewise, and joined with the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9110",964,"Bishop, for he saw that this was the best chance that had ever befallen","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9111",964,"of paying back his score in full to Robin Hood. Will Scarlet and Little","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9112",964,"John and Allan a Dale had just missed the King's men to the eastward,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9117",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9118",964,"But of all this Robin knew not a whit; so he whistled merrily as he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9119",964,"trudged along the road beyond Stanton, with his heart as free from care","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9120",964,"as the yolk of an egg is from cobwebs. At last he came to where a little","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9121",964,"stream spread across the road in a shallow sheet, tinkling and sparkling","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9122",964,"as it fretted over its bed of golden gravel. Here Robin stopped, being","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9123",964,"athirst, and, kneeling down, he made a cup of the palms of his hands,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9124",964,"and began to drink. On either side of the road, for a long distance,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9125",964,"stood tangled thickets of bushes and young trees, and it pleased Robin's","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9126",964,"heart to hear the little birds singing therein, for it made him think","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9127",964,"of Sherwood, and it seemed as though it had been a lifetime since he had","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9128",964,"breathed the air of the woodlands. But of a sudden, as he thus stooped,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9129",964,"drinking, something hissed past his ear, and struck with a splash into","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9130",964,"the gravel and water beside him. Quick as a wink Robin sprang to his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9131",964,"feet, and, at one bound, crossed the stream and the roadside, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9132",964,"plunged headlong into the thicket, without looking around, for he knew","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9133",964,"right well that that which had hissed so venomously beside his ear was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9134",964,"a gray goose shaft, and that to tarry so much as a moment meant death.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9135",964,"Even as he leaped into the thicket six more arrows rattled among the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9136",964,"branches after him, one of which pierced his doublet, and would have","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9137",964,"struck deeply into his side but for the tough coat of steel that he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9138",964,"wore. Then up the road came riding some of the King's men at headlong","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9139",964,"speed. They leaped from their horses and plunged straightway into the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9140",964,"thicket after Robin. But Robin knew the ground better than they did,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9141",964,"so crawling here, stooping there, and, anon, running across some little","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9142",964,"open, he soon left them far behind, coming out, at last, upon another","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9143",964,"road about eight hundred paces distant from the one he had left. Here he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9144",964,"stood for a moment, listening to the distant shouts of the seven men","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9145",964,"as they beat up and down in the thickets like hounds that had lost the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9146",964,"scent of the quarry. Then, buckling his belt more tightly around his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9147",964,"waist, he ran fleetly down the road toward the eastward and Sherwood.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9148",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9149",964,"But Robin had not gone more than three furlongs in that direction when","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9150",964,"he came suddenly to the brow of a hill, and saw beneath him another band","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9151",964,"of the King's men seated in the shade along the roadside in the valley","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9152",964,"beneath. Then he paused not a moment, but, seeing that they had not","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9153",964,"caught sight of him, he turned and ran back whence he had come, knowing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9154",964,"that it was better to run the chance of escaping those fellows that were","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9155",964,"yet in the thickets than to rush into the arms of those in the valley.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9156",964,"So back he ran with all speed, and had gotten safely past the thickets,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9157",964,"when the seven men came forth into the open road. They raised a great","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9158",964,"shout when they saw him, such as the hunter gives when the deer breaks","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9159",964,"cover, but Robin was then a quarter of a mile and more away from them,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9160",964,"coursing over the ground like a greyhound. He never slackened his pace,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9161",964,"but ran along, mile after mile, till he had come nigh to Mackworth, over","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9162",964,"beyond the Derwent River, nigh to Derby Town. Here, seeing that he was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9163",964,"out of present danger, he slackened in his running, and at last sat him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9164",964,"down beneath a hedge where the grass was the longest and the shade the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9165",964,"coolest, there to rest and catch his wind. ""By my soul, Robin,"" quoth he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9166",964,"to himself, ""that was the narrowest miss that e'er thou hadst in all","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9360",964,"sleekness of his robes and the richness of his rosary. He called to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9361",964,"landlord, and bade him first have his mule well fed and bedded in the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9382",964,"fellow as you could find in all England, nevertheless there was nothing","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9384",964,"he went off, grumbling like the now distant thunder. When he came to the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9387",964,"rough, dirty-bearded fellow, he beheld as fresh and clean a lad as one","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9388",964,"could find in a week of Sundays; so, slipping off his clothes, he also","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9389",964,"huddled into the bed, where Robin, grunting and grumbling in his sleep,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9398",964,"gaped and how he stared, for there beside him lay one all shaven and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9399",964,"shorn, so that he knew that it must be a fellow in holy orders. He","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9400",964,"pinched himself sharply, but, finding he was awake, sat up in bed, while","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9401",964,"the other slumbered as peacefully as though he were safe and sound at","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9404",964,"softly, so as not to waken the other, and looking about the room he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9405",964,"espied the friar's clothes lying upon a bench near the wall. First he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9406",964,"looked at the clothes, with his head on one side, and then he looked","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9407",964,"at the friar and slowly winked one eye. Quoth he, ""Good Brother","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9412",964,"stableman that was up and about the stables opened his eyes as though he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9413",964,"saw a green mouse before him, for such men as the friars of Emmet were","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9414",964,"not wont to be early risers; but the man bottled his thoughts, and only","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9415",964,"asked Robin whether he wanted his mule brought from the stable.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9424",964,"purse with ten golden pounds in it, and nought was left but patched","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9425",964,"clothes and a leathern apron. He raged and swore like any layman, but as","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9739",964,"been befouled long enough by thee, thou vile beast! This day, Our Lady","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9740",964,"willing, thou diest--I am Robin Hood."" So saying, he flashed forth his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9743",964,"For a time Guy of Gisbourne stared upon Robin as though bereft of wits;","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9744",964,"but his wonder quickly passed to a wild rage. ""Art thou indeed Robin","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9745",964,"Hood?"" cried he. ""Now I am glad to meet thee, thou poor wretch! Shrive","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9746",964,"thyself, for thou wilt have no time for shriving when I am done with","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9749",964,"And now came the fiercest fight that ever Sherwood saw; for each man","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9750",964,"knew that either he or the other must die, and that no mercy was to be","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9751",964,"had in this battle. Up and down they fought, till all the sweet green","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9752",964,"grass was crushed and ground beneath the trampling of their heels. More","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9753",964,"than once the point of Robin Hood's sword felt the softness of flesh,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9754",964,"and presently the ground began to be sprinkled with bright red drops,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9755",964,"albeit not one of them came from Robin's veins. At last Guy of Gisbourne","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9756",964,"made a fierce and deadly thrust at Robin Hood, from which he leaped back","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9757",964,"lightly, but in so leaping he caught his heel in a root and fell heavily","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9758",964,"upon his back. ""Now, Holy Mary aid me!"" muttered he, as the other leaped","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9759",964,"at him, with a grin of rage upon his face. Fiercely Guy of Gisbourne","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9760",964,"stabbed at the other with his great sword, but Robin caught the blade in","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9761",964,"his naked hand, and, though it cut his palm, he turned the point away so","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9762",964,"that it plunged deep into the ground close beside him; then, ere a blow","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9763",964,"could be struck again, he leaped to his feet, with his good sword in","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9764",964,"his hand. And now despair fell upon Guy of Gisbourne's heart in a black","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9765",964,"cloud, and he looked around him wildly, like a wounded hawk. Seeing that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9766",964,"his strength was going from him, Robin leaped forward, and, quick as a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9767",964,"flash, struck a back-handed blow beneath the sword arm. Down fell","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9768",964,"the sword from Guy of Gisbourne's grasp, and back he staggered at the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9769",964,"stroke, and, ere he could regain himself, Robin's sword passed through","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9770",964,"and through his body. Round he spun upon his heel, and, flinging his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9771",964,"hands aloft with a shrill, wild cry, fell prone upon his face upon the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9788",964,"hand, together with the two bows of yew, he drew the cowl of horse's","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9789",964,"hide over his face, so that none could tell who he was, and set forth","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9790",964,"from the forest, turning his steps toward the eastward and Nottingham","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9801",964,"to the highroad and to where a little thatched cottage stood back of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9802",964,"a cluster of twisted crab trees, with flowers in front of it. Here he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9803",964,"stopped of a sudden, for he thought that he heard the sound of someone","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9804",964,"in sorrow. He listened, and found that it came from the cottage; so,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9805",964,"turning his footsteps thither, he pushed open the wicket and entered","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"9806",964,"the place. There he saw a gray-haired dame sitting beside a cold","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"9861",964,"Sheriff's men sat upon the bench before the door, quaffing ale, or lay","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10873",964,"and now, with the yearning, came a great longing to sound his bugle once","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10881",964,"along, sunk in meditation, the faint, clear notes of a distant bugle","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10887",964,"yearning, of joy, and yet of grief, and, putting down his head, he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10888",964,"dashed into the thicket. Onward he plunged, crackling and rending, as","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10889",964,"the wild boar rushes through the underbrush. Little recked he of thorns","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10919",964,"he swore both loud and deep, and took a solemn vow that he would not","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10920",964,"rest until he had Robin Hood in his power, dead or alive. Now there","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10921",964,"was present at court a certain knight, Sir William Dale, as gallant a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10922",964,"soldier as ever donned harness. Sir William Dale was well acquainted","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10923",964,"with Sherwood Forest, for he was head keeper over that part of it that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10924",964,"lay nigh to good Mansfield Town; so to him the King turned, and bade him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10925",964,"take an army of men and go straightway to seek Robin Hood. Likewise the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10926",964,"King gave Sir William his signet ring to show to the Sheriff, that he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10927",964,"might raise all his armed men to aid the others in their chase of Robin.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10928",964,"So Sir William and the Sheriff set forth to do the King's bidding and to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10929",964,"search for Robin Hood; and for seven days they hunted up and down, yet","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10934",964,"had fought for years under King Richard, and was changed from what he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10935",964,"used to be. It galled his pride to thus flee away before those sent","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10936",964,"against him, as a chased fox flees from the hounds; so thus it came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10937",964,"about, at last, that Robin Hood and his yeomen met Sir William and the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10938",964,"Sheriff and their men in the forest, and a bloody fight followed. The","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10939",964,"first man slain in that fight was the Sheriff of Nottingham, for he fell","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10940",964,"from his horse with an arrow in his brain ere half a score of shafts had","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10941",964,"been sped. Many a better man than the Sheriff kissed the sod that day,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10942",964,"but at last, Sir William Dale being wounded and most of his men slain,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10943",964,"he withdrew, beaten, and left the forest. But scores of good fellows","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10944",964,"were left behind him, stretched out all stiff beneath the sweet green","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10945",964,"boughs.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10948",964,"this lay heavily upon his mind, so that he brooded over it until a fever","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10949",964,"seized upon him. For three days it held him, and though he strove to","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10950",964,"fight it off, he was forced to yield at last. Thus it came that, on the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10951",964,"morning of the fourth day, he called Little John to him, and told him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10952",964,"that he could not shake the fever from him, and that he would go to his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10953",964,"cousin, the prioress of the nunnery near Kirklees, in Yorkshire, who was","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10954",964,"a skillful leech, and he would have her open a vein in his arm and take","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10955",964,"a little blood from him, for the bettering of his health. Then he bade","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10956",964,"Little John make ready to go also, for he might perchance need aid in","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10957",964,"his journeying. So Little John and he took their leave of the others,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10958",964,"and Robin Hood bade Will Stutely be the captain of the band until they","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10959",964,"should come back. Thus they came by easy stages and slow journeying","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10960",964,"until they reached the Nunnery of Kirklees.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10961",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10962",964,"Now Robin had done much to aid this cousin of his; for it was through","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10963",964,"King Richard's love of him that she had been made prioress of the place.","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10965",964,"when the Prioress of Kirklees had heard how her cousin, the Earl of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10967",964,"she was vexed to the soul, and feared lest her cousinship with him","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10968",964,"should bring the King's wrath upon her also. Thus it happened that when","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10969",964,"Robin came to her and told her how he wished her services as leech, she","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10970",964,"began plotting ill against him in her mind, thinking that by doing evil","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10971",964,"to him she might find favor with his enemies. Nevertheless, she kept","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10972",964,"this well to herself and received Robin with seeming kindness. She led","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10973",964,"him up the winding stone stair to a room which was just beneath the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10974",964,"eaves of a high, round tower; but she would not let Little John come","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10976",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10977",964,"So the poor yeoman turned his feet away from the door of the nunnery,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10978",964,"and left his master in the hands of the women. But, though he did not","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10979",964,"come in, neither did he go far away; for he laid him down in a little","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10980",964,"glade near by, where he could watch the place that Robin abided, like","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10984",964,"After the women had gotten Robin Hood to the room beneath the eaves, the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10985",964,"Prioress sent all of the others away; then, taking a little cord, she","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10986",964,"tied it tightly about Robin's arm, as though she were about to bleed","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10987",964,"him. And so she did bleed him, but the vein she opened was not one of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10988",964,"those that lie close and blue beneath the skin; deeper she cut than","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10989",964,"that, for she opened one of those veins through which the bright red","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10990",964,"blood runs leaping from the heart. Of this Robin knew not; for, though","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10991",964,"he saw the blood flow, it did not come fast enough to make him think","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"10993",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10994",964,"Having done this vile deed, the Prioress turned and left her cousin,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10995",964,"locking the door behind her. All that livelong day the blood ran from","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10996",964,"Robin Hood's arm, nor could he check it, though he strove in every way","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10997",964,"to do so. Again and again he called for help, but no help came, for his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10998",964,"cousin had betrayed him, and Little John was too far away to hear his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"10999",964,"voice. So he bled and bled until he felt his strength slipping away from","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11001",964,"his hands against the wall, he reached his bugle horn at last. Thrice","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11002",964,"he sounded it, but weakly and faintly, for his breath was fluttering","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11003",964,"through sickness and loss of strength; nevertheless, Little John heard","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11004",964,"it where he lay in the glade, and, with a heart all sick with dread, he","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11005",964,"came running and leaping toward the nunnery. Loudly he knocked at the","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11006",964,"door, and in a loud voice shouted for them to let him in, but the door","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11007",964,"was of massive oak, strongly barred, and studded with spikes, so they","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11012",964,"mortar, such as three men could not lift nowadays. Little John took","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11013",964,"three steps forward, and, bending his back, heaved the stone mortar up","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11014",964,"from where it stood deeply rooted. Staggering under its weight, he came","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11015",964,"forward and hurled it crashing against the door. In burst the door, and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11016",964,"away fled the frightened nuns, shrieking, at his coming. Then Little","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11021",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11053",964,"But Robin Hood took Little John's rough, brown fist in his white hands,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11054",964,"and chid him softly in his low, weak voice, asking him since what time","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11055",964,"Little John had thought of doing harm to women, even in vengeance. Thus","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11056",964,"he talked till, at last, the other promised, in a choking voice, that no","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11057",964,"ill should fall upon the place, no matter what happened. Then a silence","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11058",964,"fell, and Little John sat with Robin Hood's hand in his, gazing out of","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11059",964,"the open window, ever and anon swallowing a great lump that came in his","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11064",964,"Robin Hood's head lay on his friend's shoulder. Long he gazed, with a","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11065",964,"wide, lingering look, while the other sat with bowed head, the hot tears","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11066",964,"rolling one after another from his eyes, and dripping upon his bosom,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11067",964,"for he felt that the time of parting was near at hand. Then, presently,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11068",964,"Robin Hood bade him string his stout bow for him, and choose a smooth","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11070",964,"disturbing his master or rising from where he sat. Robin Hood's fingers","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11081",964,"His old strength seemed to come back to him, and, drawing the bowstring","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11082",964,"to his ear, he sped the arrow out of the open casement. As the shaft","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11083",964,"flew, his hand sank slowly with the bow till it lay across his knees,","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11087",964,"","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11088",964,"For some minutes Little John sat motionless, but presently he laid that","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11089",964,"which he held gently down, then, folding the hands upon the breast and","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
"11090",964,"covering up the face, he turned upon his heel and left the room without","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"

"11098",964,"turned and left them, and they presently saw him running rapidly across","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","Pyle, Howard","Fantasy","en"
