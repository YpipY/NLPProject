"29",966,"trout-stream, and in the midst of woodland coverts, abounding with","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"30",966,"excellent game. The bride, with her father and attendant maidens,","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"31",966,"entered the chapel; but the earl had not arrived. The baron was amazed,","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"32",966,"and the bridemaidens were disconcerted. Matilda feared that some evil","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"33",966,"had befallen her lover, but felt no diminution of her confidence in his","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"37",966,"the first that caught the glitter of snowy plumes, and the light of","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"565",966,"Saxon cavaliers all on a row. The very excess of the baron's internal","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"566",966,"rage on the preceding day had smothered its external manifestation: he","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"567",966,"was so equally angry with both parties, that he knew not on which to","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"568",966,"vent his wrath. He was enraged with the earl for having brought himself","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"569",966,"into such a dilemma without his privily; and he was no less enraged with","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"570",966,"the king's men for their very unseasonable intrusion. He could willingly","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"571",966,"have fallen upon both parties, but, he must necessarily have begun with","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"572",966,"one; and he felt that on whichever side he should strike the first blow,","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"573",966,"his retainers would immediately join battle. He had therefore contented","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"575",966,"the course of the evening he had received intelligence that the earl's","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"577",966,"detached by Sir Ralph Montfaucon to seize on it during the earl's","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"578",966,"absence. The baron inferred from this that the earl's case was","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"581",966,"feelings how quickly and completely the whole moral being of the earl","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"583",966,"to require in his daughter's mind the same summary revolution that had","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"2941",966,"coherent in his replies to her questions, that the lady fell implicitly","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"2954",966,"time and war, which he weighed with a comparison of the lady's age,","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"2962",966,"","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2963",966,"As they passed over the drawbridge, they met Sir Ralph Montfaucon and","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"2966",966,"countenances struck Sir Ralph with a kind of imperfect recognition,","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2967",966,"which would never have been matured, but that the eyes of Marian, as","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2968",966,"she passed him, encountered his, and the images of those stars of beauty","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2969",966,"continued involuntarily twinkling in his sensorium to the exclusion of","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2970",966,"all other ideas, till memory, love, and hope concurred with imagination","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"2972",966,"Those eyes, he thought, were certainly the eyes of Matilda Fitzwater;","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"2974",966,"consecutive, that the rest of the body they belonged to was hers also.","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2975",966,"Now, if it were really Matilda Fitzwater, who were her two companions?","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2976",966,"The baron? Aye, and the elder pilgrim was something like him. And the","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2977",966,"earl of Huntingdon? Very probably. The earl and the baron might be good","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2978",966,"friends again, now that they were both in disgrace together. While he","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2979",966,"was revolving these cogitations, he was introduced to the lady, and","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2980",966,"after claiming and receiving the promise of hospitality, he inquired","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2981",966,"what she knew of the pilgrims who had just departed? The lady told him","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2982",966,"they were newly returned from Palestine, having been long in the Holy","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2983",966,"Land. The knight expressed some scepticism on this point. The lady","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2984",966,"replied, that they had given her so minute a detail of her lord's","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2985",966,"proceedings, and so accurate a description of his person, that she could","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2986",966,"not be deceived in them. This staggered the knight's confidence in","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2987",966,"his own penetration; and if it had not been a heresy in knighthood to","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2988",966,"suppose for a moment that there could be in rerum natura such another","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2989",966,"pair of eyes as those of his mistress, he would have acquiesced","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2990",966,"implicitly in the lady's judgment. But while the lady and the knight","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2991",966,"were conversing, the warder blew his bugle-horn, and presently entered","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"2992",966,"a confidential messenger from Palestine, who gave her to understand","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"3014",966,"which rose high above them in a thick rampart of foliage, and descended","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"3016",966,"dashing in its rocky channel, and saw its white foam gleaming at","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"3017",966,"intervals in the last faint glimmerings of twilight. In a short time all","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"3018",966,"was dark, and the rising voice of the wind foretold a coming storm. They","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"3019",966,"turned a point of the valley, and saw a light below them in the depth","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"3020",966,"of the hollow, shining through a cottage-casement and dancing in its","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"3021",966,"reflection on the restless stream. Robin blew his horn, which was","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"3023",966,"torch, ascended the steep, showed tokens of great delight at meeting","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"3024",966,"with Robin, and lighted them down a flight of steps rudely cut in the","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
"3025",966,"rock, and over a series of rugged stepping-stones, that crossed","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"

"3027",966,"neatness, comfort, and plenty, being amply enriched with pots, pans,","Maid Marian","Peacock, Thomas Love","Historical Fiction","en"
