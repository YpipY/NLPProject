"954",989,"methodically, I will show that prophecies varied, not only according to","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"963",989,"truth, such as is implied in every clear and distinct idea, but requires","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"965",989,"cannot afford certainty, and the prophets were assured of God's revelation","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"966",989,"by some sign, and not by the fact of revelation, as we may see from Abraham,","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1551",989,"power of God, by which alone all things happen and are determined, it","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"1552",989,"follows that whatsoever man, as a part of nature, provides himself with to","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"1842",989,"concludes that since God is the God of all nations, that is, is equally","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"2565",989,"(47) Lastly, as obedience consists in acting at the bidding of external","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"2566",989,"authority, it would have no place in a state where the government is vested","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"2645",989,"are so bound. (65) Examining this question by the aid of natural reason, I","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"

"2647",989,"","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
"2648",989,"(66) If anyone wishes to persuade his fellows for or against anything which","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1","Spinoza, Benedictus de","Philosophy","en"
